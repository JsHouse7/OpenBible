## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Headless UI
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- A Supabase account
- A Vercel account (for deployment)

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd OpenBible
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=OpenBible
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The literature library reads `public.works` with the anon key. Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` have to be present. If either is missing, `/api/literature/list` and `/api/literature/load` respond with HTTP 503 and code `SUPABASE_NOT_CONFIGURED`. The library then says the server is not configured. It does not describe that failure as an empty search.

`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only. Do not prefix it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, and do not use it to bypass row-level security for catalog reads. Works remain publicly readable under the existing policy. Signed-out readers can open the catalog; saving an account preference still requires a session and returns 401 without one. That 401 is not a catalog error.

On Vercel, set the two public variables for every environment that should show books. This repository does not change those production values.

### 3. Supabase Setup

1. **Create a new Supabase project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Get your credentials** from Settings > API
3. **Run the database schema**:
   - Go to SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
   - Run the script to create all tables and sample data

### 4. Migrate Bible Data
```bash
npm run migrate:bible
```
This will transfer all Bible verses from JSON files to your Supabase database.

### 5. Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your app running!

### 6. Authentication
- Visit `/auth` to test the authentication system
- Create a new account or sign in
- All user data (notes, bookmarks, highlights) will be saved to your account

## 📊 Database Schema

The app uses the following main tables:

- **`bible_verses`** - Bible text content (KJV included)
- **`user_notes`** - Personal study notes linked to verses
- **`user_bookmarks`** - Saved favorite verses
- **`user_highlights`** - Highlighted verses with colors
- **`reading_progress`** - Track reading progress per book
- **`authors`** - Christian authors (for future literature feature)
- **`works`** - Christian literature works (for future feature)
