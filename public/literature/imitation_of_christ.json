          "content": "INTRODUCTORY NOTE\nThe treatise “Of the Imitation of Christ” appears to have been\noriginally written in Latin early in the fifteenth century. Its exact\ndate and its authorship are still a matter of debate. Manuscripts of\nthe Latin version survive in considerable numbers all over Western\nEurope, and they, with the vast list of translations and of printed\neditions, testify to its almost unparalleled popularity. One scribe\nattributes it to St. Bernard of Clairvaux; but the fact that it\ncontains a quotation from St. Francis of Assisi, who was born thirty\nyears after the death of St. Bernard, disposes of this theory. In\nEngland there exist many manuscripts of the first three books, called\n“Musica Ecclesiastica,” frequently ascribed to the English mystic\nWalter Hilton. But Hilton seems to have died in 1395, and there is no\nevidence of the existence of the work before 1400. Many manuscripts\nscattered throughout Europe ascribe the book to Jean le Charlier de\nGerson, the great Chancellor of the University of Paris, who was a\nleading figure in the Church in the earlier part of the fifteenth\ncentury. The most probable author, however, especially when the\ninternal evidence is considered, is Thomas Haemmerlein, known also as\nThomas à Kempis, from his native town of Kempen, near the Rhine, about\nforty miles north of Cologne. Haemmerlein, who was born in 1379 or\n1380, was a member of the order of the Brothers of Common Life, and\nspent the last seventy years of his life at Mount St. Agnes, a\nmonastery of Augustinian canons in the diocese of Utrecht. Here he died\non July 26, 1471, after an uneventful life spent in copying\nmanuscripts, reading, and composing, and in the peaceful routine of\nmonastic piety.\nWith the exception of the Bible, no Christian writing has had so wide a\nvogue or so sustained a popularity as this. And yet, in one sense, it\nis hardly an original work at all. Its structure it owes largely to the\nwritings of the medieval mystics, and its ideas and phrases are a\nmosaic from the Bible and the Fathers of the early Church. But these\nelements are interwoven with such delicate skill and a religious\nfeeling at once so ardent and so sound, that it promises to remain,\nwhat it has been for five hundred years, the supreme call and guide to\nspiritual aspiration.\nTHE IMITATION OF CHRIST"

Let it be our most earnest\nstudy, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ.\n2. His teaching surpasseth all teaching of holy men, and such as have\nHis Spirit find therein the hidden manna.(2) But there are many who,\nthough they frequently hear the Gospel, yet feel but little longing\nafter it, because they have not the mind of Christ. He, therefore, that\nwill fully and with true wisdom understand the words of Christ, let him\nstrive to conform his whole life to that mind of Christ.\n3. What doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussion concerning\nthe Holy Trinity, if thou lack humility, and be thus displeasing to the\nTrinity? For verily it is not deep words that make a man holy and\nupright; it is a good life which maketh a man dear to God. I had rather\nfeel contrition than be skilful in the definition thereof. If thou\nknewest the whole Bible, and the sayings of all the philosophers, what\nshould all this profit thee without the love and grace of God? Vanity\nof vanities, all is vanity, save to love God, and Him only to serve.\nThat is the highest wisdom, to cast the world behind us, and to reach\nforward to the heavenly kingdom.\n4. It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches that\nshall perish. It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and to lift up\nourselves on high. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh and\nbe led by them, for this shall bring misery at the last. It is vanity\nto desire a long life, and to have little care for a good life. It is\nvanity to take thought only for the life which now is, and not to look\nforward to the things which shall be hereafter. It is vanity to love\nthat which quickly passeth away, and not to hasten where eternal joy\nabideth.\n5. Be ofttimes mindful of the saying,(3) The eye is not satisfied with\nseeing, nor the ear with hearing. Strive, therefore, to turn away thy\nheart from the love of the things that are seen, and to set it upon the\nthings that are not seen. For they who follow after their own fleshly\nlusts, defile the conscience, and destroy the grace of God.\n(1) John viii. 12. (2) Revelations ii. 17. (3) Ecclesiastes i. 8."

Better of a surety is a lowly\npeasant who serveth God, than a proud philosopher who watcheth the\nstars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself. He who knoweth himself\nwell is vile in his own sight; neither regardeth he the praises of men.\nIf I knew all the things that are in the world, and were not in\ncharity, what should it help me before God, who is to judge me\naccording to my deeds?\n2. Rest from inordinate desire of knowledge, for therein is found much\ndistraction and deceit. Those who have knowledge desire to appear\nlearned, and to be called wise. Many things there are to know which\nprofiteth little or nothing to the soul. And foolish out of measure is\nhe who attendeth upon other things rather than those which serve to his\nsoul’s health. Many words satisfy not the soul, but a good life\nrefresheth the mind, and a pure conscience giveth great confidence\ntowards God.\n3. The greater and more complete thy knowledge, the more severely shalt\nthou be judged, unless thou hast lived holily. Therefore be not lifted\nup by any skill or knowledge that thou hast; but rather fear concerning\nthe knowledge which is given to thee. If it seemeth to thee that thou\nknowest many things, and understandest them well, know also that there\nare many more things which thou knowest not. Be not high-minded, but\nrather confess thine ignorance. Why desirest thou to lift thyself above\nanother, when there are found many more learned and more skilled in the\nScripture than thou? If thou wilt know and learn anything with profit,\nlove to be thyself unknown and to be counted for nothing.\n4. That is the highest and most profitable lesson, when a man truly\nknoweth and judgeth lowly of himself. To account nothing of one’s self,\nand to think always kindly and highly of others, this is great and\nperfect wisdom. Even shouldest thou see thy neighbor sin openly or\ngrievously, yet thou oughtest not to reckon thyself better than he, for\nthou knowest not how long thou shalt keep thine integrity.

What\ndoth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which\nwe shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them\nnot? Oh, grievous folly, to neglect the things which are profitable and\nnecessary, and to give our minds to things which are curious and\nhurtful! Having eyes, we see not.\n2. And what have we to do with talk about genus and species! He to whom\nthe Eternal Word speaketh is free from multiplied questionings. From\nthis One Word are all things, and all things speak of Him; and this is\nthe Beginning which also speaketh unto us.(2) No man without Him\nunderstandeth or rightly judgeth. The man to whom all things are one,\nwho bringeth all things to one, who seeth all things in one, he is able\nto remain steadfast of spirit, and at rest in God. O God, who art the\nTruth, make me one with Thee in everlasting love. It wearieth me\noftentimes to read and listen to many things; in Thee is all that I\nwish for and desire. Let all the doctors hold their peace; let all\ncreation keep silence before Thee: speak Thou alone to me.\n3. The more a man hath unity and simplicity in himself, the more things\nand the deeper things he understandeth; and that without labour,\nbecause he receiveth the light of understanding from above. The spirit\nwhich is pure, sincere, and steadfast, is not distracted though it hath\nmany works to do, because it doth all things to the honour of God, and\nstriveth to be free from all thoughts of self-seeking. Who is so full\nof hindrance and annoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined heart? A\nman who is good and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own heart\nthe works which he hath to do abroad; and so is not drawn away by the\ndesires of his evil will, but subjecteth everything to the judgment of\nright reason. Who hath a harder battle to fight than he who striveth\nfor self-mastery? And this should be our endeavour, even to master\nself, and thus daily to grow stronger than self, and go on unto\nperfection.\n4. All perfection hath some imperfection joined to it in this life, and\nall our power of sight is not without some darkness. A lowly knowledge\nof thyself is a surer way to God than the deep searching of man’s\nlearning. Not that learning is to be blamed, nor the taking account of\nanything that is good; but a good conscience and a holy life is better\nthan all. And because many seek knowledge rather than good living,\ntherefore they go astray, and bear little or no fruit.\n5. O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of vice and\nthe planting of virtue which they give unto vain questionings: there\nhad not been so many evil doings and stumbling-blocks among the laity,\nnor such ill living among houses of religion. Of a surety, at the Day\nof Judgment it will be demanded of us, not what we have read, but what\nwe have done; not how well we have spoken, but how holily we have\nlived. Tell me, where now are all those masters and teachers, whom thou\nknewest well, whilst they were yet with you, and flourished in\nlearning? Their stalls are now filled by others, who perhaps never have\none thought concerning them. Whilst they lived they seemed to be\nsomewhat, but now no one speaks of them.\n6. Oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away! Would that their\nlife and knowledge had agreed together! For then would they have read\nand inquired unto good purpose. How many perish through empty learning\nin this world, who care little for serving God. And because they love\nto be great more than to be humble, therefore they “have become vain in\ntheir imaginations.” He only is truly great, who hath great charity. He\nis truly great who deemeth himself small, and counteth all height of\nhonour as nothing. He is the truly wise man, who counteth all earthly\nthings as dung that he may win Christ. And he is the truly learned man,\nwho doeth the will of God, and forsaketh his own will.\n(1) Psalm xciv. 12; Numbers xii. 8. (2) John viii. 25 (Vulg.)."

Wherefore it is written in Job, The life of man upon the earth\nis a trial.(1) And therefore ought each of us to give heed concerning\ntrials and temptations, and watch unto prayer, lest the devil find\noccasion to deceive; for he never sleepeth, but goeth about seeking\nwhom he may devour. No man is so perfect in holiness that he hath never\ntemptations, nor can we ever be wholly free from them.\n2. Yet, notwithstanding, temptations turn greatly unto our profit, even\nthough they be great and hard to bear; for through them we are humbled,\npurified, instructed. All Saints have passed through much tribulation\nand temptation, and have profited thereby. And they who endured not\ntemptation became reprobate and fell away. There is no position so\nsacred, no place so secret, that it is without temptations and\nadversities.\n3. There is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he liveth,\nbecause we have the root of temptation within ourselves, in that we are\nborn in concupiscence. One temptation or sorrow passeth, and another\ncometh; and always we shall have somewhat to suffer, for we have fallen\nfrom perfect happiness. Many who seek to fly from temptations fall yet\nmore deeply into them. By flight alone we cannot overcome, but by\nendurance and true humility we are made stronger than all our enemies.\n4. He who only resisteth outwardly and pulleth not up by the root,\nshall profit little; nay, rather temptations will return to him the\nmore quickly, and will be the more terrible. Little by little, through\npatience and long-suffering, thou shalt conquer by the help of God,\nrather than by violence and thine own strength of will. In the midst of\ntemptation often seek counsel; and deal not hardly with one who is\ntempted, but comfort and strengthen him as thou wouldest have done unto\nthyself.\n5. The beginning of all temptations to evil is instability of temper\nand want of trust in God; for even as a ship without a helm is tossed\nabout by the waves, so is a man who is careless and infirm of purpose\ntempted, now on this side, now on that. As fire testeth iron, so doth\ntemptation the upright man. Oftentimes we know not what strength we\nhave; but temptation revealeth to us what we are. Nevertheless, we must\nwatch, especially in the beginnings of temptation; for then is the foe\nthe more easily mastered, when he is not suffered to enter within the\nmind, but is met outside the door as soon as he hath knocked. Wherefore\none saith,\nCheck the beginnings; once thou might’st have cured,\nBut now ’tis past thy skill, too long hath it endured.\nFor first cometh to the mind the simple suggestion, then the strong\nimagination, afterwards pleasure, evil affection, assent. And so little\nby little the enemy entereth in altogether, because he was not resisted\nat the beginning. And the longer a man delayeth his resistance, the\nweaker he groweth, and the stronger groweth the enemy against him.\n6. Some men suffer their most grievous temptations in the beginning of\ntheir conversion, some at the end. Some are sorely tried their whole\nlife long. Some there are who are tempted but lightly, according to the\nwisdom and justice of the ordering of God, who knoweth the character\nand circumstances of men, and ordereth all things for the welfare of\nHis elect.\n7. Therefore we ought not to despair when we are tempted, but the more\nfervently should cry unto God, that He will vouchsafe to help us in all\nour tribulation; and that He will, as St. Paul saith, with the\ntemptation make a way to escape that we may be able to bear it.(2) Let\nus therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God in all\ntemptation and trouble, for He will save and exalt such as are of an\nhumble spirit.\n8. In temptations and troubles a man is proved, what progress he hath\nmade, and therein is his reward the greater, and his virtue doth the\nmore appear. Nor is it a great thing if a man be devout and zealous so\nlong as he suffereth no affliction; but if he behave himself patiently\nin the time of adversity, then is there hope of great progress. Some\nare kept safe from great temptations, but are overtaken in those which\nare little and common, that the humiliation may teach them not to trust\nto themselves in great things, being weak in small things.\n(1) Job vii. 1 (Vulg.).

Bethink thee that\nperhaps it is better for thy trial and patience, without which our\nmerits are but little worth. Nevertheless thou oughtest, when thou\nfindeth such impediments, to beseech God that He would vouchsafe to\nsustain thee, that thou be able to bear them with a good will.\n2. If one who is once or twice admonished refuse to hearken, strive not\nwith him, but commit all to God, that His will may be done and His\nhonour be shown in His servants, for He knoweth well how to convert the\nevil unto good. Endeavour to be patient in bearing with other men’s\nfaults and infirmities whatsoever they be, for thou thyself also hast\nmany things which have need to be borne with by others. If thou canst\nnot make thine own self what thou desireth, how shalt thou be able to\nfashion another to thine own liking. We are ready to see others made\nperfect, and yet we do not amend our own shortcomings.\n3. We will that others be straitly corrected, but we will not be\ncorrected ourselves. The freedom of others displeaseth us, but we are\ndissatisfied that our own wishes shall be denied us. We desire rules to\nbe made restraining others, but by no means will we suffer ourselves to\nbe restrained. Thus therefore doth it plainly appear how seldom we\nweigh our neighbour in the same balance with ourselves. If all men were\nperfect, what then should we have to suffer from others for God?\n4. But now hath God thus ordained, that we may learn to bear one\nanother’s burdens, because none is without defect, none without a\nburden, none sufficient of himself, none wise enough of himself; but it\nbehoveth us to bear with one another, to comfort one another, to help,\ninstruct, admonish one another. How much strength each man hath is best\nproved by occasions of adversity: for such occasions do not make a man\nfrail, but show of what temper he is."

Ah! What is our life when compared\nto theirs? They, saints and friends of Christ as they were, served the\nLord in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness, in labour and\nweariness, in watchings and fastings, in prayer and holy meditations,\nin persecutions and much rebuke.\n2. O how many and grievous tribulations did the Apostles, Martyrs,\nConfessors, Virgins, endure; and all others who would walk in the\nfootsteps of Christ. For they hated their souls in this world that they\nmight keep them unto life eternal. O how strict and retired a life was\nthat of the holy fathers who dwelt in the desert! what long and\ngrievous temptations they did suffer! how often were they assaulted by\nthe enemy! what frequent and fervid prayers did they offer unto God!\nwhat strict fasts did they endure! what fervent zeal and desire after\nspiritual profit did they manifest! how bravely did they fight that\ntheir vices might not gain the mastery! how entirely and steadfastly\ndid they reach after God! By day they laboured, and at night they gave\nthemselves ofttimes unto prayer; yea, even when they were labouring\nthey ceased not from mental prayer.\n3. They spent their whole time profitably; every hour seemed short for\nretirement with God; and through the great sweetness of contemplation,\neven the need of bodily refreshment was forgotten. They renounced all\nriches, dignities, honours, friends, kinsmen; they desired nothing from\nthe world; they ate the bare necessaries of life; they were unwilling\nto minister to the body even in necessity. Thus were they poor in\nearthly things, but rich above measure in grace and virtue. Though poor\nto the outer eye, within they were filled with grace and heavenly\nbenedictions.\n4. They were strangers to the world, but unto God they were as kinsmen\nand friends. They seemed unto themselves as of no reputation, and in\nthe world’s eyes contemptible; but in the sight of God they were\nprecious and beloved. They stood fast in true humility, they lived in\nsimple obedience, they walked in love and patience; and thus they waxed\nstrong in spirit, and obtained great favour before God. To all\nreligious men they were given as an example, and they ought more to\nprovoke us unto good livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth\nto carelessness of life.\n5. O how great was the love of all religious persons at the beginning\nof this sacred institution! O what devoutness of prayer! what rivalry\nin holiness! what strict discipline was observed! what reverence and\nobedience under the rule of the master showed they in all things! The\ntraces of them that remain until now testify that they were truly holy\nand perfect men, who fighting so bravely trod the world underfoot. Now\na man is counted great if only he be not a transgressor, and if he can\nonly endure with patience what he hath undertaken.\n6. O the coldness and negligence of our times, that we so quickly\ndecline from the former love, and it is become a weariness to live,\nbecause of sloth and lukewarmness. May progress in holiness not wholly\nfall asleep in thee, who many times hast seen so many examples of\ndevout men!"

          "content": "Of the exercises of a religious man\nThe life of a Christian ought to be adorned with all virtues, that he\nmay be inwardly what he outwardly appeareth unto men. And verily it\nshould be yet better within than without, for God is a discerner of our\nheart, Whom we must reverence with all our hearts wheresoever we are,\nand walk pure in His presence as do the angels. We ought daily to renew\nour vows, and to kindle our hearts to zeal, as if each day were the\nfirst day of our conversion, and to say, “Help me, O God, in my good\nresolutions, and in Thy holy service, and grant that this day I may\nmake a good beginning, for hitherto I have done nothing!”\n2. According to our resolution so is the rate of our progress, and much\ndiligence is needful for him who would make good progress. For if he\nwho resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short, how shall it be with\nhim who resolveth rarely or feebly? But manifold causes bring about\nabandonment of our resolution, yet a trivial omission of holy exercises\ncan hardly be made without some loss to us. The resolution of the\nrighteous dependeth more upon the grace of God than upon their own\nwisdom; for in Him they always put their trust, whatsoever they take in\nhand. For man proposeth, but God disposeth; and the way of a man is not\nin himself.(1)\n3. If a holy exercise be sometimes omitted for the sake of some act of\npiety, or of some brotherly kindness, it can easily be taken up\nafterwards; but if it be neglected through distaste or slothfulness,\nthen is it sinful, and the mischief will be felt. Strive as earnestly\nas we may, we shall still fall short in many things. Always should some\ndistinct resolution be made by us; and, most of all, we must strive\nagainst those sins which most easily beset us. Both our outer and inner\nlife should be straitly examined and ruled by us, because both have to\ndo with our progress.\n4. If thou canst not be always examining thyself, thou canst at certain\nseasons, and at least twice in the day, at evening and at morning. In\nthe morning make thy resolves, and in the evening inquire into thy\nlife, how thou hast sped to-day in word, deed, and thought; for in\nthese ways thou hast often perchance offended God and thy neighbour.\nGird up thy lions like a man against the assaults of the devil; bridle\nthine appetite, and thou wilt soon be able to bridle every inclination\nof the flesh. Be thou never without something to do; be reading, or\nwriting, or praying, or meditating, or doing something that is useful\nto the community. Bodily exercises, however, must be undertaken with\ndiscretion, nor are they to be used by all alike.\n5. The duties which are not common to all must not be done openly, but\nare safest carried on in secret. But take heed that thou be not\ncareless in the common duties, and more devout in the secret; but\nfaithfully and honestly discharge the duties and commands which lie\nupon thee, then afterwards, if thou hast still leisure, give thyself to\nthyself as thy devotion leadeth thee. All cannot have one exercise, but\none suiteth better to this man and another to that. Even for the\ndiversity of season different exercises are needed, some suit better\nfor feasts, some for fasts. We need one kind in time of temptations and\nothers in time of peace and quietness. Some are suitable to our times\nof sadness, and others when we are joyful in the Lord.\n6. When we draw near the time of the great feasts, good exercises\nshould be renewed, and the prayers of holy men more fervently besought.\nWe ought to make our resolutions from one Feast to another, as if each\nwere the period of our departure from this world, and of entering into\nthe eternal feast. So ought we to prepare ourselves earnestly at solemn\nseasons, and the more solemnly to live, and to keep straightest watch\nupon each holy observance, as though we were soon to receive the reward\nof our labours at the hand of God.\n7. And if this be deferred, let us believe ourselves to be as yet\nill-prepared, and unworthy as yet of the glory which shall be revealed\nin us at the appointed season; and let us study to prepare ourselves\nthe better for our end. Blessed is that servant, as the Evangelist Luke\nhath it, whom, when the Lord cometh He shall find watching. Verily I\nsay unto you He will make him ruler over all that He hath.(2)\n(1) Jeremiah x. 23. (2) Luke xii. 43, 44."

          "content": "Of the love of solitude and silence\nSeek a suitable time for thy meditation, and think frequently of the\nmercies of God to thee. Leave curious questions. Study such matters as\nbring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement. If thou withdraw\nthyself from trifling conversation and idle goings about, as well as\nfrom novelties and gossip, thou shalt find thy time sufficient and apt\nfor good meditation. The greatest saints used to avoid as far as they\ncould the company of men, and chose to live in secret with God.\n2. One hath said, “As oft as I have gone among men, so oft have I\nreturned less a man.” This is what we often experience when we have\nbeen long time in conversation. For it is easier to be altogether\nsilent than it is not to exceed in word. It is easier to remain hidden\nat home than to keep sufficient guard upon thyself out of doors. He,\ntherefore, that seeketh to reach that which is hidden and spiritual,\nmust go with Jesus “apart from the multitude.” No man safely goeth\nabroad who loveth not to rest at home. No man safely talketh but he who\nloveth to hold his peace. No man safely ruleth but he who loveth to be\nsubject. No man safely commandeth but he who loveth to obey.\n3. No man safely rejoiceth but he who hath the testimony of a good\nconscience within himself. The boldness of the Saints was always full\nof the fear of God. Nor were they the less earnest and humble in\nthemselves, because they shone forth with great virtues and grace. But\nthe boldness of wicked men springeth from pride and presumption, and at\nthe last turneth to their own confusion. Never promise thyself security\nin this life, howsoever good a monk or devout a solitary thou seemest.\n4. Often those who stand highest in the esteem of men, fall the more\ngrievously because of their over great confidence. Wherefore it is very\nprofitable unto many that they should not be without inward temptation,\nbut should be frequently assaulted, lest they be over confident, lest\nthey be indeed lifted up into pride, or else lean too freely upon the\nconsolations of the world. O how good a conscience should that man\nkeep, who never sought a joy that passeth away, who never became\nentangled with the world! O how great peace and quiet should he\npossess, who would cast off all vain care, and think only of healthful\nand divine things, and build his whole hope upon God!\n5. No man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath diligently\nexercised himself in holy compunction. If thou wilt feel compunction\nwithin thy heart, enter into thy chamber and shut out the tumults of\nthe world, as it is written, Commune with your own heart in your own\nchamber and be still.(1) In retirement thou shalt find what often thou\nwilt lose abroad. Retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth sweet,\nbut if thou keep not in it, begetteth weariness. If in the beginning of\nthy conversation thou dwell in it and keep it well, it shall afterwards\nbe to thee a dear friend, and a most pleasant solace.\n6. In silence and quiet the devout soul goeth forward and learneth the\nhidden things of the Scriptures. Therein findeth she a fountain of\ntears, wherein to wash and cleanse herself each night, that she may\ngrow the more dear to her Maker as she dwelleth the further from all\nworldly distraction. To him who withdraweth himself from his\nacquaintance and friends God with his holy angels will draw nigh. It is\nbetter to be unknown and take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself\nand work wonders. It is praiseworthy for a religious man to go seldom\nabroad, to fly from being seen, to have no desire to see men.\n7. Why wouldest thou see what thou mayest not have? The world passeth\naway and the lust thereof. The desires of sensuality draw thee abroad,\nbut when an hour is past, what dost thou bring home, but a weight upon\nthy conscience and distraction of heart? A merry going forth bringeth\noften a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning? So\ndoth all carnal joy begin pleasantly, but in the end it gnaweth away\nand destroyeth. What canst thou see abroad which thou seest not at\nhome? Behold the heaven and the earth and the elements, for out of\nthese are all things made.\n8. What canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the sun?\nThou believest perchance that thou shalt be satisfied, but thou wilt\nnever be able to attain unto this. If thou shouldest see all things\nbefore thee at once, what would it be but a vain vision? Lift up thine\neyes to God on high, and pray that thy sins and negligences may be\nforgiven. Leave vain things to vain men, and mind thou the things which\nGod hath commanded thee. Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto thyself\nJesus thy beloved. Remain with Him in thy chamber, for thou shalt not\nelsewhere find so great peace. If thou hadst not gone forth nor\nlistened to vain talk, thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace.\nBut because it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things, thou must\ntherefore suffer trouble of heart.\n(1) Psalm iv. 4."

Give thyself to compunction\nof heart and thou shalt find devotion. Compunction openeth the way for\nmany good things, which dissoluteness is wont quickly to lose. It is\nwonderful that any man can ever rejoice heartily in this life who\nconsidereth and weigheth his banishment, and the manifold dangers which\nbeset his soul.\n2. Through lightness of heart and neglect of our shortcomings we feel\nnot the sorrows of our soul, but often vainly laugh when we have good\ncause to weep. There is no true liberty nor real joy, save in the fear\nof God with a good conscience. Happy is he who can cast away every\ncause of distraction and bring himself to the one purpose of holy\ncompunction. Happy is he who putteth away from him whatsoever may stain\nor burden his conscience. Strive manfully; custom is overcome by\ncustom. If thou knowest how to let men alone, they will gladly let thee\nalone to do thine own works.\n3. Busy not thyself with the affairs of others, nor entangle thyself\nwith the business of great men. Keep always thine eye upon thyself\nfirst of all, and give advice to thyself specially before all thy\ndearest friends. If thou hast not the favour of men, be not thereby\ncast down, but let thy concern be that thou holdest not thyself so well\nand circumspectly, as becometh a servant of God and a devout monk. It\nis often better and safer for a man not to have many comforts in this\nlife, especially those which concern the flesh. But that we lack divine\ncomforts or feel them rarely is to our own blame, because we seek not\ncompunction of heart, nor utterly cast away those comforts which are\nvain and worldly.\n4. Know thyself to be unworthy of divine consolation, and worthy rather\nof much tribulation. When a man hath perfect compunction, then all the\nworld is burdensome and bitter to him. A good man will find sufficient\ncause for mourning and weeping; for whether he considereth himself, or\npondereth concerning his neighbour, he knoweth that no man liveth here\nwithout tribulation, and the more thoroughly he considereth himself,\nthe more thoroughly he grieveth. Grounds for just grief and inward\ncompunction there are in our sins and vices, wherein we lie so\nentangled that we are but seldom able to contemplate heavenly things.\n5. If thou thoughtest upon thy death more often than how long thy life\nshould be, thou wouldest doubtless strive more earnestly to improve.\nAnd if thou didst seriously consider the future pains of hell, I\nbelieve thou wouldest willingly endure toil or pain and fear not\ndiscipline. But because these things reach not the heart, and we still\nlove pleasant things, therefore we remain cold and miserably\nindifferent.\n6. Oftentimes it is from poverty of spirit that the wretched body is so\neasily led to complain. Pray therefore humbly unto the Lord that He\nwill give thee the spirit of compunction and say in the language of the\nprophet, _Feed me, O Lord, with bread of tears, and give me\nplenteousness of tears to drink_.(1)\n(1) Psalm lxxx. 5."

Why art thou disquieted because\nit happeneth not to thee according to thy wishes and desires? Who is he\nthat hath everything according to his will? Neither I, nor thou, nor\nany man upon the earth. There is no man in the world free from trouble\nor anguish, though he were King or Pope. Who is he who hath the\nhappiest lot? Even he who is strong to suffer somewhat for God.\n2. There are many foolish and unstable men who say, “See what a\nprosperous life that man hath, how rich and how great he is, how\npowerful, how exalted.” But lift up thine eyes to the good things of\nheaven, and thou shalt see that all these worldly things are nothing,\nthey are utterly uncertain, yea, they are wearisome, because they are\nnever possessed without care and fear. The happiness of man lieth not\nin the abundance of temporal things but a moderate portion sufficeth\nhim. Our life upon the earth is verily wretchedness. The more a man\ndesireth to be spiritual, the more bitter doth the present life become\nto him; because he the better understandeth and seeth the defects of\nhuman corruption. For to eat, to drink, to watch, to sleep, to rest, to\nlabour, and to be subject to the other necessities of nature, is truly\na great wretchedness and affliction to a devout man, who would fain be\nreleased and free from all sin.\n3. For the inner man is heavily burdened with the necessities of the\nbody in this world. Wherefore the prophet devoutly prayeth to be freed\nfrom them, saying, Deliver me from my necessities, O Lord.(1) But woe\nto those who know not their own misery, and yet greater woe to those\nwho love this miserable and corruptible life. For to such a degree do\nsome cling to it (even though by labouring or begging they scarce\nprocure what is necessary for subsistence) that if they might live here\nalways, they would care nothing for the Kingdom of God.\n4. Oh foolish and faithless of heart, who lie buried so deep in worldly\nthings, that they relish nothing save the things of the flesh!\nMiserable ones! they will too sadly find out at the last, how vile and\nworthless was that which they loved. The saints of God and all loyal\nfriends of Christ held as nothing the things which pleased the flesh,\nor those which flourished in this life, but their whole hope and\naffection aspired to the things which are above. Their whole desire was\nborne upwards to everlasting and invisible things, lest they should be\ndrawn downwards by the love of things visible.\n5. Lose not, brother, thy loyal desire of progress to things spiritual.\nThere is yet time, the hour is not past. Why wilt thou put off thy\nresolution? Arise, begin this very moment, and say, “Now is the time to\ndo: now is the time to fight, now is the proper time for amendment.”\nWhen thou art ill at ease and troubled, then is the time when thou art\nnearest unto blessing. Thou must go through fire and water that God may\nbring thee into a wealthy place. Unless thou put force upon thyself,\nthou wilt not conquer thy faults. So long as we carry about with us\nthis frail body, we cannot be without sin, we cannot live without\nweariness and trouble. Gladly would we have rest from all misery; but\nbecause through sin we have lost innocence, we have lost also the true\nhappiness. Therefore must we be patient, and wait for the mercy of God,\nuntil this tyranny be overpast, and this mortality be swallowed up of\nlife.\n6. O how great is the frailty of man, which is ever prone to evil!\nTo-day thou confessest thy sins, and to-morrow thou committest again\nthe sins thou didst confess. Now dost thou resolve to avoid a fault,\nand within an hour thou behavest thyself as if thou hadst never\nresolved at all. Good cause have we therefore to humble ourselves, and\nnever to think highly of ourselves, seeing that we are so frail and\nunstable. And quickly may that be lost by our negligence, which by much\nlabour was hardly attained through grace.\n7. What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are\nlukewarm and idle? Woe unto us, if we choose to rest, as though it were\na time of peace and security, while as yet no sign appeareth in our\nlife of true holiness. Rather had we need that we might begin yet\nafresh, like good novices, to be instructed unto good living, if haply\nthere might be hope of some future amendment and greater spiritual\nincrease.\n(1) Psalm xxv. 17."

O the dulness and hardness of man’s heart, which\nthinketh only of the present, and looketh not forward to the future.\nThou oughtest in every deed and thought so to order thyself, as if thou\nwert to die this day. If thou hadst a good conscience thou wouldst not\ngreatly fear death. It were better for thee to watch against sin, than\nto fly from death. If to-day thou art not ready, how shalt thou be\nready to-morrow? To-morrow is an uncertain day; and how knowest thou\nthat thou shalt have a to-morrow?\n2. What doth it profit to live long, when we amend so little? Ah! long\nlife doth not always amend, but often the more increaseth guilt. Oh\nthat we might spend a single day in this world as it ought to be spent!\nMany there are who reckon the years since they were converted, and yet\noftentimes how little is the fruit thereof. If it is a fearful thing to\ndie, it may be perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long.

It is better for thee now to provide in time, and to send\nsome good before thee, than to trust to the help of others. If thou art\nnot anxious for thyself now, who, thinkest thou, will be anxious for\nthee afterwards? Now the time is most precious. Now is the accepted\ntime, now is the day of salvation. But alas! that thou spendest not\nwell this time, wherein thou mightest lay up treasure which should\nprofit thee everlastingly. The hour will come when thou shalt desire\none day, yea, one hour, for amendment of life, and I know not whether\nthou shalt obtain.\n6. Oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free thyself,\nfrom what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live in fear, and in\nexpectation of death! Strive now to live in such wise that in the hour\nof death thou mayest rather rejoice than fear. Learn now to die to the\nworld, so shalt thou begin to live with Christ. Learn now to contemn\nall earthly things, and then mayest thou freely go unto Christ. Keep\nunder thy body by penitence, and then shalt thou be able to have a sure\nconfidence.\n7. Ah, foolish one! why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long, when\nthou art not sure of a single day? How many have been deceived, and\nsuddenly have been snatched away from the body! How many times hast\nthou heard how one was slain by the sword, another was drowned, another\nfalling from on high broke his neck, another died at the table, another\nwhilst at play! One died by fire, another by the sword, another by the\npestilence, another by the robber. Thus cometh death to all, and the\nlife of men swiftly passeth away like a shadow.\n8. Who will remember thee after thy death? And who will entreat for\nthee? Work, work now, oh dearly beloved, work all that thou canst. For\nthou knowest not when thou shalt die, nor what shall happen unto thee\nafter death. While thou hast time, lay up for thyself undying riches.\nThink of nought but of thy salvation; care only for the things of God.\nMake to thyself friends, by venerating the saints of God and walking in\ntheir steps, that when thou failest, thou mayest be received into\neverlasting habitations.(2)\n9.

What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins? The more\nthou sparest thyself and followest the flesh, the more heavy shall thy\npunishment be, and the more fuel art thou heaping up for the burning.\nFor wherein a man hath sinned, therein shall he be the more heavily\npunished. There shall the slothful be pricked forward with burning\ngoads, and the gluttons be tormented with intolerable hunger and\nthirst. There shall the luxurious and the lovers of pleasure be plunged\ninto burning pitch and stinking brimstone, and the envious shall howl\nlike mad dogs for very grief.\n4. No sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own proper\npunishment. The proud shall be filled with utter confusion, and the\ncovetous shall be pinched with miserable poverty. An hour’s pain there\nshall be more grievous than a hundred years here of the bitterest\npenitence. No quiet shall be there, no comfort for the lost, though\nhere sometimes there is respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace\nof friends. Be thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the\nday of judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed. For then\nshall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such\nas have afflicted him and made no account of his labours.(1) Then shall\nhe stand up to judge, he who now submitteth himself in humility to the\njudgments of men. Then shall the poor and humble man have great\nconfidence, while the proud is taken with fear on every side.\n5. Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world who\nlearned to be a fool and despised for Christ. Then shall all\ntribulation patiently borne delight us, while the mouth of the ungodly\nshall be stopped. Then shall every godly man rejoice, and every profane\nman shall mourn. Then the afflicted flesh shall more rejoice than if it\nhad been alway nourished in delights. Then the humble garment shall put\non beauty, and the precious robe shall hide itself as vile. Then the\nlittle poor cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace.\nThen enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the\nworld. Then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than all\nworldly wisdom.\n6. Then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than learned\nphilosophy. Then contempt of riches shall have more weight than all the\ntreasure of the children of this world. Then shalt thou find more\ncomfort in having prayed devoutly than in having fared sumptuously.\nThen thou wilt rather rejoice in having kept silence than in having\nmade long speech. Then holy deeds shall be far stronger than many fine\nwords. Then a strict life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper\npleasure than all earthly delight. Learn now to suffer a little, that\nthen thou mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings. Prove first\nhere, what thou art able to endure hereafter. If now thou art able to\nbear so little, how wilt thou be able to endure eternal torments? If\nnow a little suffering maketh thee so impatient, what shall hell-fire\ndo then? Behold of a surety thou art not able to have two Paradises, to\ntake thy fill or delight here in this world, and to reign with Christ\nhereafter.\n7. If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and\npleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to thee\nin an instant? All therefore is vanity, save to love God and to serve\nHim only. For he who loveth God with all his heart feareth not death,\nnor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell, because perfect love giveth\nsure access to God. But he who still delighteth in sin, no marvel if he\nis afraid of death and judgment. Nevertheless it is a good thing, if\nlove as yet cannot restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of\nhell should hold thee back. But he who putteth aside the fear of God\ncannot long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of\nthe devil.\n(1) Wisd. v. 1."

          "content": "Of the zealous amendment of our whole life\nBe thou watchful and diligent in God’s service, and bethink thee often\nwhy thou hast renounced the world. Was it not that thou mightest live\nto God and become a spiritual man? Be zealous, therefore, for thy\nspiritual profit, for thou shalt receive shortly the reward of thy\nlabours, and neither fear nor sorrow shall come any more into thy\nborders. Now shalt thou labour a little, and thou shalt find great\nrest, yea everlasting joy. If thou shalt remain faithful and zealous in\nlabour, doubt not that God shall be faithful and bountiful in rewarding\nthee. It is thy duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the\nvictory, but thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful\nor lifted up.\n2. A certain man being in anxiety of mind, continually tossed about\nbetween hope and fear, and being on a certain day overwhelmed with\ngrief, cast himself down in prayer before the altar in a church, and\nmeditated within himself, saying, “Oh! if I but knew that I should\nstill persevere,” and presently heard within him a voice from God, “And\nif thou didst know it, what wouldst thou do? Do now what thou wouldst\ndo then, and thou shalt be very secure.” And straightway being\ncomforted and strengthened, he committed himself to the will of God and\nthe perturbation of spirit ceased, neither had he a mind any more to\nsearch curiously to know what should befall him hereafter, but studied\nrather to inquire what was the good and acceptable will of God, for the\nbeginning and perfecting of every good work.\n3. Hope in the Lord and be doing good, saith the Prophet; dwell in the\nland and thou shalt be fed(1) with its riches. One thing there is which\nholdeth back many from progress and fervent amendment, even the dread\nof difficulty, or the labour of the conflict. Nevertheless they advance\nabove all others in virtue who strive manfully to conquer those things\nwhich are most grievous and contrary to them, for there a man profiteth\nmost and meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and\nmortifieth himself in spirit.\n4. But all men have not the same passions to conquer and to mortify,\nyet he who is diligent shall attain more profit, although he have\nstronger passions, than another who is more temperate of disposition,\nbut is withal less fervent in the pursuit of virtue. Two things\nspecially avail unto improvement in holiness, namely firmness to\nwithdraw ourselves from the sin to which by nature we are most\ninclined, and earnest zeal for that good in which we are most lacking.\nAnd strive also very earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults\nwhich displease thee most frequently in others.\n5. Gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art, and wherever thou\nseest or hearest good examples, stir thyself to follow them, but where\nthou seest anything which is blameworthy, take heed that thou do not\nthe same; or if at any time thou hast done it, strive quickly to amend\nthyself. As thine eye observeth others, so again are the eyes of others\nupon thee. How sweet and pleasant is it to see zealous and godly\nbrethren temperate and of good discipline; and how sad is it and\ngrievous to see them walking disorderly, not practising the duties to\nwhich they are called. How hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose\nof their calling, and turn their inclinations to things which are none\nof their business.\n6. Be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken, and set always\nbefore thee the remembrance of the Crucified. Truly oughtest thou to be\nashamed as thou lookest upon the life of Jesus Christ, because thou\nhast not yet endeavoured to conform thyself more unto Him, though thou\nhast been a long time in the way of God. A religious man who exercises\nhimself seriously and devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our\nLord shall find there abundantly all things that are profitable and\nnecessary for him, neither is there need that he shall seek anything\nbetter beyond Jesus. Oh! if Jesus crucified would come into our hearts,\nhow quickly, and completely should we have learned all that we need to\nknow!\n7. He who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that are\nlaid upon him. He who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble upon\ntrouble, and suffereth anguish upon every side, because he is without\ninward consolation, and is forbidden to seek that which is outward. He\nwho is living without discipline is exposed to grievous ruin. He who\nseeketh easier and lighter discipline shall always be in distress,\nbecause one thing or another will give him displeasure.\n8. O! if no other duty lay upon us but to praise the Lord our God with\nour whole heart and voice! Oh! if thou never hadst need to eat or\ndrink, or sleep, but wert always able to praise God, and to give\nthyself to spiritual exercises alone; then shouldst thou be far happier\nthan now, when for so many necessities thou must serve the flesh. O!\nthat these necessities were not, but only the spiritual refreshments of\nthe soul, which alas we taste too seldom.\n9. When a man hath come to this, that he seeketh comfort from no\ncreated thing, then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy God, then also\nwill he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto him. Then\nwill he neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for little, but he\ncommitteth himself altogether and with full trust unto God, who is all\nin all to him, to whom nothing perisheth nor dieth, but all things live\nto Him and obey His every word without delay.\n10. Remember always thine end, and how the time which is lost returneth\nnot. Without care and diligence thou shalt never get virtue. If thou\nbeginnest to grow cold, it shall begin to go ill with thee, but if thou\ngivest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find much peace, and shalt find thy\nlabour the lighter because of the grace of God and the love of virtue.\nA zealous and diligent man is ready for all things. It is greater\nlabour to resist sins and passions than to toil in bodily labours. He\nwho shunneth not small faults falleth little by little into greater. At\neventide thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day profitably.\nWatch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself, and howsoever it\nbe with others, neglect not thyself. The more violence thou dost unto\nthyself, the more thou shall profit. Amen.\n(1) Psalm xxxvii. 3."

Turn thee with all\nthine heart to the Lord and forsake this miserable world, and thou\nshalt find rest unto thy soul. Learn to despise outward things and to\ngive thyself to things inward, and thou shalt see the kingdom of God\ncome within thee. For the kingdom of God is peace and joy in the Holy\nGhost, and it is not given to the wicked. Christ will come to thee, and\nshow thee His consolation, if thou prepare a worthy mansion for Him\nwithin thee. All His glory and beauty is from within, and there it\npleaseth Him to dwell. He often visiteth the inward man and holdeth\nwith him sweet discourse, giving him soothing consolation, much peace,\nfriendship exceeding wonderful.\n2. Go to, faithful soul, prepare thy heart for this bridegroom that he\nmay vouchsafe to come to thee and dwell within thee, for so He saith,\nif any man loveth me he will keep my words: and my Father will love\nhim, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.(2) Give,\ntherefore, place to Christ and refuse entrance to all others. When thou\nhast Christ, thou art rich, and hast sufficient. He shall be thy\nprovider and faithful watchman in all things, so that thou hast no need\nto trust in men, for men soon change and swiftly pass away, but Christ\nremaineth for ever and standeth by us firmly even to the end.\n3. There is no great trust to be placed in a frail and mortal man, even\nthough he be useful and dear to us, neither should much sorrow arise\nwithin us if sometimes he oppose and contradict us. They who are on thy\nside to-day, may to-morrow be against thee, and often are they turned\nround like the wind. Put thy whole trust in God and let Him be thy fear\nand thy love, He will answer for thee Himself, and will do for thee\nwhat is best. Here hast thou no continuing city,(3) and wheresoever\nthou art, thou art a stranger and a pilgrim, and thou shalt never have\nrest unless thou art closely united to Christ within thee.\n4. Why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither, since this is not\nthe place of thy rest? In heaven ought thy habitation to be, and all\nearthly things should be looked upon as it were in the passing by. All\nthings pass away and thou equally with them. Look that thou cleave not\nto them lest thou be taken with them and perish. Let thy contemplation\nbe on the Most High, and let thy supplication be directed unto Christ\nwithout ceasing. If thou canst not behold high and heavenly things,\nrest thou in the passion of Christ and dwell willingly in His sacred\nwounds. For if thou devoutly fly to the wounds of Jesus, and the\nprecious marks of the nails and the spear, thou shalt find great\ncomfort in tribulation, nor will the slights of men trouble thee much,\nand thou wilt easily bear their unkind words.\n5. Christ also, when He was in the world, was despised and rejected of\nmen, and in His greatest necessity was left by His acquaintance and\nfriends to bear these reproaches. Christ was willing to suffer and be\ndespised, and darest thou complain of any? Christ had adversaries and\ngainsayers, and dost thou wish to have all men thy friends and\nbenefactors? Whence shall thy patience attain her crown if no adversity\nbefall thee? If thou art unwilling to suffer any adversity, how shalt\nthou be the friend of Christ? Sustain thyself with Christ and for\nChrist if thou wilt reign with Christ.\n6. If thou hadst once entered into the mind of Jesus, and hadst tasted\nyea even a little of his tender love, then wouldst thou care nought for\nthine own convenience or inconvenience, but wouldst rather rejoice at\ntrouble brought upon thee, because the love of Jesus maketh a man to\ndespise himself. He who loveth Jesus, and is inwardly true and free\nfrom inordinate affections, is able to turn himself readily unto God,\nand to rise above himself in spirit, and to enjoy fruitful peace.\n7. He who knoweth things as they are and not as they are said or seem\nto be, he truly is wise, and is taught of God more than of men. He who\nknoweth how to walk from within, and to set little value upon outward\nthings, requireth not places nor waiteth for seasons, for holding his\nintercourse with God. The inward man quickly recollecteth himself,\nbecause he is never entirely given up to outward things. No outward\nlabour and no necessary occupations stand in his way, but as events\nfall out, so doth he fit himself to them. He who is rightly disposed\nand ordered within careth not for the strange and perverse conduct of\nmen. A man is hindered and distracted in so far as he is moved by\noutward things.\n8. If it were well with thee, and thou wert purified from evil, all\nthings would work together for thy good and profiting. For this cause\ndo many things displease thee and often trouble thee, that thou art not\nyet perfectly dead to thyself nor separated from all earthly things.\nNothing so defileth and entangleth the heart of man as impure love\ntowards created things. If thou rejectest outward comfort thou wilt be\nable to contemplate heavenly things and frequently to be joyful\ninwardly.\n(1) Luke xvii. 21. (2) John xiv. 23. (3) Hebrews xiii. 14."

If thou knowest\nhow to hold thy peace and to suffer, without doubt thou shalt see the\nhelp of the Lord. He knoweth the time and the way to deliver thee,\ntherefore must thou resign thyself to Him. To God it belongeth to help\nand to deliver from all confusion. Oftentimes it is very profitable for\nkeeping us in greater humility, that others know and rebuke our faults.\n2. When a man humbleth himself for his defects, he then easily\npacifieth others and quickly satisfieth those that are angered against\nhim. God protecteth and delivereth the humble man, He loveth and\ncomforteth the humble man, to the humble man He inclineth Himself, on\nthe humble He bestoweth great grace, and when he is cast down He\nraiseth him to glory: to the humble He revealeth His secrets, and\nsweetly draweth and inviteth him to Himself.

He often saith\nwhat he ought not to say, and omitteth what it were more expedient for\nhim to do. He considereth to what duties others are bound, and\nneglecteth those to which he is bound himself. Therefore be zealous\nfirst over thyself, and then mayest thou righteously be zealous\nconcerning thy neighbour.\n2. Thou knowest well how to excuse and to colour thine own deeds, but\nthou wilt not accept the excuses of others. It would be more just to\naccuse thyself and excuse thy brother. If thou wilt that others bear\nwith thee, bear thou with others. Behold how far thou art as yet from\nthe true charity and humility which knows not how to be angry or\nindignant against any save self alone. It is no great thing to mingle\nwith the good and the meek, for this is naturally pleasing to all, and\nevery one of us willingly enjoyeth peace and liketh best those who\nthink with us: but to be able to live peaceably with the hard and\nperverse, or with the disorderly, or those who oppose us, this is a\ngreat grace and a thing much to be commended and most worthy of a man.\n3. There are who keep themselves in peace and keep peace also with\nothers, and there are who neither have peace nor suffer others to have\npeace; they are troublesome to others, but always more troublesome to\nthemselves. And there are who hold themselves in peace, and study to\nbring others unto peace; nevertheless, all our peace in this sad life\nlieth in humble suffering rather than in not feeling adversities. He\nwho best knoweth how to suffer shall possess the most peace; that man\nis conqueror of himself and lord of the world, the friend of Christ,\nand the inheritor of heaven."

No good action will be distasteful to thee if thou be free\nwithin from inordinate affection. If thou reachest after and seekest,\nnothing but the will of God and the benefit of thy neighbour, thou wilt\nentirely enjoy inward liberty. If thine heart were right, then should\nevery creature be a mirror of life and a book of holy doctrine. There\nis no creature so small and vile but that it showeth us the goodness of\nGod.\n2. If thou wert good and pure within, then wouldst thou look upon all\nthings without hurt and understand them aright. A pure heart seeth the\nvery depths of heaven and hell. Such as each one is inwardly, so\njudgeth he outwardly.

For when the grace of God cometh to a man, then he\nbecometh able to do all things, and when it departeth then he will be\npoor and weak and given up unto troubles. In these thou art not to be\ncast down nor to despair, but to rest with calm mind on the will of\nGod, and to bear all things which come upon thee unto the praise of\nJesus Christ; for after winter cometh summer, after night returneth\nday, after the tempest a great calm.\n(1) John xi. 28."

          "content": "Of the lack of all comfort\nIt is no hard thing to despise human comfort when divine is present. It\nis a great thing, yea very great, to be able to bear the loss both of\nhuman and divine comfort; and for the love of God willingly to bear\nexile of heart, and in nought to seek oneself, nor to look to one’s own\nmerit. What great matter is it, if thou be cheerful of heart and devout\nwhen favour cometh to thee? That is an hour wherein all rejoice.\nPleasantly enough doth he ride whom the grace of God carrieth. And what\nmarvel, if he feeleth no burden who is carried by the Almighty, and is\nled onwards by the Guide from on high?\n2. We are willing to accept anything for comfort, and it is difficult\nfor a man to be freed from himself. The holy martyr Laurence overcame\nthe love of the world and even of his priestly master, because he\ndespised everything in the world which seemed to be pleasant; and for\nthe love of Christ he calmly suffered even God’s chief priest, Sixtus,\nwhom he dearly loved, to be taken from him. Thus by the love of the\nCreator he overcame the love of man, and instead of human comfort he\nchose rather God’s good pleasure. So also learn thou to resign any near\nand beloved friend for the love of God. Nor take it amiss when thou\nhast been deserted by a friend, knowing that we must all be parted from\none another at last.\n3. Mightily and long must a man strive within himself before he learn\naltogether to overcome himself, and to draw his whole affection towards\nGod. When a man resteth upon himself, he easily slippeth away unto\nhuman comforts. But a true lover of Christ, and a diligent seeker after\nvirtue, falleth not back upon those comforts, nor seeketh such\nsweetness as may be tasted and handled, but desireth rather hard\nexercises, and to undertake severe labours for Christ.\n4. When, therefore, spiritual comfort is given by God, receive it with\ngiving of thanks, and know that it is the gift of God, not thy desert.\nBe not lifted up, rejoice not overmuch nor foolishly presume, but\nrather be more humble for the gift, more wary and more careful in all\nthy doings; for that hour will pass away, and temptation will follow.\nWhen comfort is taken from thee, do not straightway despair, but wait\nfor the heavenly visitation with humility and patience, for God is able\nto give thee back greater favour and consolation. This is not new nor\nstrange to those who have made trial of the way of God, for with the\ngreat saints and the ancient prophets there was often this manner of\nchange.\n5. Wherefore one said when the favour of God was present with him, I\nsaid in my prosperity I shall never be moved,(1) but he goeth on to say\nwhat he felt within himself when the favour departed: Thou didst turn\nThy face from me, and I was troubled. In spite whereof he in no wise\ndespaireth, but the more instantly entreateth God, and saith, Unto\nThee, O Lord, will I cry, and will pray unto my God; and then he\nreceiveth the fruit of his prayer, and testifieth how he hath been\nheard, saying, The Lord heard me and had mercy upon me, the Lord was my\nhelper. But wherein? Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy, Thou hast\nput off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness. If it was thus with\nthe great saints, we who are poor and needy ought not to despair if we\nare sometimes in the warmth and sometimes in the cold, for the Spirit\ncometh and goeth according to the good pleasure of His will. Wherefore\nholy Job saith, Thou dost visit him in the morning, and suddenly Thou\ndost prove him.(2)\n6. Whereupon then can I hope, or wherein may I trust, save only in the\ngreat mercy of God, and the hope of heavenly grace? For whether good\nmen are with me, godly brethren or faithful friends, whether holy books\nor beautiful discourses, whether sweet hymns and songs, all these help\nbut little, and have but little savour when I am deserted by God’s\nfavour and left to mine own poverty. There is no better remedy, then,\nthan patience and denial of self, and an abiding in the will of God.\n7. I have never found any man so religious and godly, but that he felt\nsometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour, and lack of fervour. No\nsaint was ever so filled with rapture, so enlightened, but that sooner\nor later he was tempted. For he is not worthy of the great vision of\nGod, who, for God’s sake, hath not been exercised by some temptation.\nFor temptation is wont to go before as a sign of the comfort which\nshall follow, and heavenly comfort is promised to those who are proved\nby temptation. As it is written, To him that overcometh I will give to\neat of the tree of life.(3)\n8. Divine comfort is given that a man may be stronger to bear\nadversities. And temptation followeth, lest he be lifted up because of\nthe benefit. The devil sleepeth not; thy flesh is not yet dead;\ntherefore, cease thou not to make thyself ready unto the battle, for\nenemies stand on thy right hand and on thy left, and they are never at\nrest.\n(1) Psalm xxx. 6. (2) Job vii. 18. (3) Revelation ii. 7."

          "content": "Of gratitude for the Grace of God\nWhy seekest thou rest when thou art born to labour? Prepare thyself for\npatience more than for comforts, and for bearing the cross more than\nfor joy. For who among the men of this world would not gladly receive\nconsolation and spiritual joy if he might always have it? For spiritual\ncomforts exceed all the delights of the world, and all the pleasures of\nthe flesh. For all worldly delights are either empty or unclean, whilst\nspiritual delights alone are pleasant and honourable, the offspring of\nvirtue, and poured forth by God into pure minds. But no man can always\nenjoy these divine comforts at his own will, because the season of\ntemptation ceaseth not for long.\n2. Great is the difference between a visitation from above and false\nliberty of spirit and great confidence in self. God doeth well in\ngiving us the grace of comfort, but man doeth ill in not immediately\ngiving God thanks thereof. And thus the gifts of grace are not able to\nflow unto us, because we are ungrateful to the Author of them, and\nreturn them not wholly to the Fountain whence they flow. For grace ever\nbecometh the portion of him who is grateful and that is taken away from\nthe proud, which is wont to be given to the humble.\n3. I desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction, I\nlove no contemplation which leadeth to pride. For all that is high is\nnot holy, nor is everything that is sweet good; every desire is not\npure; nor is everything that is dear to us pleasing unto God. Willingly\ndo I accept that grace whereby I am made humbler and more wary and more\nready to renounce myself. He who is made learned by the gift of grace\nand taught wisdom by the stroke of the withdrawal thereof, will not\ndare to claim any good thing for himself, but will rather confess that\nhe is poor and needy. Give unto God the thing which is God’s,(1) and\nascribe to thyself that which is thine; that is, give thanks unto God\nfor His grace, but for thyself alone confess thy fault, and that thy\npunishment is deserved for thy fault.\n4. Sit thou down always in the lowest room and thou shalt be given the\nhighest place.(2) For the highest cannot be without the lowest. For the\nhighest saints of God are least in their own sight, and the more\nglorious they are, so much the lowlier are they in themselves; full of\ngrace and heavenly glory, they are not desirous of vain-glory; resting\non God and strong in His might, they cannot be lifted up in any wise.\nAnd they who ascribe unto God all the good which they have received,\n“seek not glory one of another, but the glory which cometh from God\nonly,” and they desire that God shall be praised in Himself and in all\nHis Saints above all things, and they are always striving for this very\nthing.\n5. Be thankful, therefore, for the least benefit and thou shalt be\nworthy to receive greater. Let the least be unto thee even as the\ngreatest, and let that which is of little account be unto thee as a\nspecial gift. If the majesty of the Giver be considered, nothing that\nis given shall seem small and of no worth, for that is not a small\nthing which is given by the Most High God. Yea, though He gave\npunishment and stripes, we ought to be thankful, because He ever doth\nfor our profit whatever He suffereth to come upon us. He who seeketh to\nretain the favour of God, let him be thankful for the favour which is\ngiven, and patient in respect of that which is taken away. Let him pray\nthat it may return; let him be wary and humble that he lose it not.\n(1) Matthew xxii. 21. (2) Luke xiv. 10."

          "content": "Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus\nJesus hath many lovers of His heavenly kingdom, but few bearers of His\nCross. He hath many seekers of comfort, but few of tribulation. He\nfindeth many companions of His table, but few of His fasting. All\ndesire to rejoice with Him, few are willing to undergo anything for His\nsake. Many follow Jesus that they may eat of His loaves, but few that\nthey may drink of the cup of His passion. Many are astonished at His\nMiracles, few follow after the shame of His Cross. Many love Jesus so\nlong as no adversities happen to them. Many praise Him and bless Him,\nso long as they receive any comforts from Him. But if Jesus hide\nHimself and withdraw from them a little while, they fall either into\ncomplaining or into too great dejection of mind.\n2. But they who love Jesus for Jesus’ sake, and not for any consolation\nof their own, bless Him in all tribulation and anguish of heart as in\nthe highest consolation. And if He should never give them consolation,\nnevertheless they would always praise Him and always give Him thanks.\n3. Oh what power hath the pure love of Jesus, unmixed with any gain or\nlove of self! Should not all they be called mercenary who are always\nseeking consolations? Do they not prove themselves lovers of self more\nthan of Christ who are always seeking their own gain and advantage?\nWhere shall be found one who is willing to serve God altogether for\nnought?\n4. Rarely is any one found so spiritual as to be stripped of all\nselfish thoughts, for who shall find a man truly poor in spirit and\nfree of all created things? “His value is from afar, yea from the ends\nof the earth.” A man may give away all his goods, yet that is nothing;\nand if he do many deeds of penitence, yet that is a small thing; and\nthough he understand all knowledge, yet that is afar off; and if he\nhave great virtue and zealous devotion, yet much is lacking unto him,\nyea, one thing which is the most necessary to him of all. What is it\nthen? That having given up all things besides, he give up himself and\ngo forth from himself utterly, and retain nothing of self-love; and\nhaving done all things which he knoweth to be his duty to do, that he\nfeel that he hath done nothing. Let him not reckon that much which\nmight be much esteemed, but let him pronounce himself to be in truth an\nunprofitable servant, as the Truth Himself saith, When ye have done all\nthings that are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants.(1)\nThen may he be truly poor and naked in spirit, and be able to say with\nthe Prophet, As for me, I am poor and needy.(2) Nevertheless, no man is\nricher than he, no man stronger, no man freer. For he knoweth both how\nto give up himself and all things, and how to be lowly in his own eyes.\n(1) Luke xvii. 10. (2) Psalm xxv. 16."

          "content": "Of the royal way of the Holy Cross\nThat seemeth a hard saying to many, If any man will come after Me, let\nhim deny himself and take up his Cross and follow Me.(1) But it will be\nmuch harder to hear that last sentence, Depart from me, ye wicked, into\neternal fire.(2) For they who now willingly hear the word of the Cross\nand follow it, shall not then fear the hearing of eternal damnation.\nThis sign of the Cross shall be in heaven when the Lord cometh to\nJudgment. Then all servants of the Cross, who in life have conformed\nthemselves to the Crucified, shall draw nigh unto Christ the Judge with\ngreat boldness.\n2. Why fearest thou then to take up the cross which leadeth to a\nkingdom? In the Cross is health, in the Cross is life, in the Cross is\nprotection from enemies, in the Cross is heavenly sweetness, in the\nCross strength of mind, in the Cross joy of the spirit, in the Cross\nthe height of virtue, in the Cross perfection of holiness. There is no\nhealth of the soul, no hope of eternal life, save in the Cross. Take up\ntherefore, thy cross and follow Jesus and thou shalt go into eternal\nlife. He went before thee bearing His Cross and died for thee upon the\nCross, that thou also mayest bear thy cross and mayest love to be\ncrucified upon it. For if thou be dead with Him, thou shalt also live\nwith Him, and if thou be a partaker of His sufferings thou shalt be\nalso of His glory.\n3. Behold everything dependeth upon the Cross, and everything lieth in\ndying; and there is none other way unto life and to true inward peace,\nexcept the way of the Holy Cross and of daily mortification. Go where\nthou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt, and thou shalt find no higher way\nabove nor safer way below, than the way of the Holy Cross. Dispose and\norder all things according to thine own will and judgment, and thou\nshalt ever find something to suffer either willingly or unwillingly,\nand thus thou shalt ever find thy cross. For thou shalt either feel\npain of body, or tribulation of spirit within thy soul.\n4. Sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of God, sometimes thou wilt be tried\nby thy neighbour, and which is more, thou wilt often be wearisome to\nthyself. And still thou canst not be delivered nor eased by any remedy\nor consolation, but must bear so long as God will. For God will have\nthee learn to suffer tribulation without consolation, and to submit\nthyself fully to it, and by tribulation be made more humble. No man\nunderstandeth the Passion of Christ in his heart so well as he who hath\nhad somewhat of the like suffering himself. The Cross therefore is\nalways ready, and every where waiteth for thee. Thou canst not flee\nfrom it whithersoever thou hurriest, for whithersoever thou comest,\nthou bearest thyself with thee, and shalt ever find thyself. Turn thee\nabove, turn thee below, turn thee without, turn thee within, and in\nthem all thou shalt find the Cross; and needful is it that thou\neverywhere possess patience if thou wilt have internal peace and gain\nthe everlasting crown.\n5. If thou willingly bear the Cross, it will bear thee, and will bring\nthee to the end which thou seekest, even where there shall be the end\nof suffering; though it shall not be here. If thou bear it unwillingly,\nthou makest a burden for thyself and greatly increaseth thy load, and\nyet thou must bear it. If thou cast away one cross, without doubt thou\nshalt find another and perchance a heavier.\n6. Thinketh thou to escape what no mortal hath been able to avoid?\nWhich of the saints in the world hath been without the cross and\ntribulation? For not even Jesus Christ our Lord was one hour without\nthe anguish of His Passion, so long as He lived. It behooved, He said,\nChrist to suffer and to rise from the dead, and so enter into his\nglory.(3) And how dost thou seek another way than this royal way, which\nis the way of the Holy Cross?\n7. The whole life of Christ was a cross and martyrdom, and dost thou\nseek for thyself rest and joy? Thou art wrong, thou art wrong, if thou\nseekest aught but to suffer tribulations, for this whole mortal life is\nfull of miseries, and set round with crosses. And the higher a man hath\nadvanced in the spirit, the heavier crosses he will often find, because\nthe sorrow of his banishment increaseth with the strength of his love.\n8. But yet the man who is thus in so many wise afflicted, is not\nwithout refreshment of consolation, because he feeleth abundant fruit\nto be growing within him out of the bearing of his cross. For whilst he\nwillingly submitteth himself to it, every burden of tribulation is\nturned into an assurance of divine comfort, and the more the flesh is\nwasted by affliction, the more is the spirit strengthened mightily by\ninward grace. And ofttimes so greatly is he comforted by the desire for\ntribulation and adversity, through love of conformity to the Cross of\nChrist, that he would not be without sorrow and tribulation; for he\nbelieveth that he shall be the more acceptable to God, the more and the\nheavier burdens he is able to bear for His sake. This is not the virtue\nof man, but the grace of Christ which hath such power and energy in the\nweak flesh, that what it naturally hateth and fleeth from, this it\ndraweth to and loveth through fervour of spirit.\n9. It is not in the nature of man to bear the cross, to love the cross,\nto keep under the body and to bring it into subjection, to fly from\nhonours, to bear reproaches meekly, to despise self and desire to be\ndespised, to bear all adversities and losses, and to desire no\nprosperity in this world. If thou lookest to thyself, thou wilt of\nthyself be able to do none of this; but if thou trustest in the Lord,\nendurance shall be given thee from heaven, and the world and the flesh\nshall be made subject to thy command. Yea, thou shalt not even fear\nthine adversary the devil, if thou be armed with faith and signed with\nthe Cross of Christ.\n10. Set thyself, therefore, like a good and faithful servant of Christ,\nto the manful bearing of the Cross of thy Lord, who out of love was\ncrucified for thee. Prepare thyself for the bearing many adversities\nand manifold troubles in this wretched life; because so it shall be\nwith thee wheresoever thou art, and so in very deed thou shalt find it,\nwherever thou hide thyself. This it must be; and there is no means of\nescaping from tribulation and sorrow, except to bear them patiently.\nDrink thou lovingly thy Lord’s cup if thou desirest to be His friend\nand to have thy lot with Him. Leave consolations to God, let Him do as\nseemeth best to Him concerning them. But do thou set thyself to endure\ntribulations, and reckon them the best consolations; for the sufferings\nof this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which\nshall be revealed in us,(4) nor would they be even if thou wert to\nendure them all.\n11. When thou hast come to this, that tribulation is sweet and pleasant\nto thee for Christ’s sake, then reckon that it is well with thee,\nbecause thou hast found paradise on earth. So long as it is hard to\nthee to suffer and thou desirest to escape, so long it will not be well\nwith thee, and tribulations will follow thee everywhere.\n12. If thou settest thyself to that thou oughtest, namely, to suffer\nand to die, it shall soon go better with thee, and thou shalt find\npeace. Though thou shouldest be caught up with Paul unto the third\nheaven,(5) thou art not on that account secure from suffering evil. I\nwill show him, saith Jesus, what great things he must suffer for My\nName’s sake.(6) It remaineth, therefore, to thee to suffer, if thou\nwilt love Jesus and serve Him continually.\n13. Oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of Jesus,\nhow great glory should await thee, what rejoicing among all the saints\nof God, what bright example also to thy neighbour! For all men commend\npatience, although few be willing to practise it. Thou oughtest surely\nto suffer a little for Christ when many suffer heavier things for the\nworld.\n14. Know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of a\ndying man. And the more a man dieth to himself, the more he beginneth\nto live towards God. None is fit for the understanding of heavenly\nthings, unless he hath submitted himself to bearing adversities for\nChrist. Nothing more acceptable to God, nothing more healthful for\nthyself in this world, than to suffer willingly for Christ. And if it\nwere thine to choose, thou oughtest rather to wish to suffer\nadversities for Christ, than to be refreshed with manifold\nconsolations, for thou wouldest be more like Christ and more conformed\nto all saints. For our worthiness and growth in grace lieth not in many\ndelights and consolations, but rather in bearing many troubles and\nadversities.\n15. If indeed there had been anything better and more profitable to the\nhealth of men than to suffer, Christ would surely have shown it by word\nand example. For both the disciples who followed Him, and all who\ndesire to follow Him, He plainly exhorteth to bear their cross, and\nsaith, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up\nhis cross, and follow Me.(7) So now that we have thoroughly read and\nstudied all things, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. We\nmust through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.(8)\n(1) Matthew xvi. 24. (2) Matthew xxv. 41. (3) Luke xxiv. 46. (4) Romans\nviii. 18. (5) 2 Corinthians xii. 2. (6) Acts ix. 16.

If the truth shall make thee free, thou\nshalt be free indeed, and shalt not care for the vain words of men.”\n2. Lord, it is true as Thou sayest; let it, I pray Thee, be so with me;\nlet Thy truth teach me, let it keep me and preserve me safe unto the\nend. Let it free me from all evil and inordinate affection, and I will\nwalk before Thee in great freedom of heart.\n3. “I will teach thee,” saith the Truth, “the things which are right\nand pleasing before Me. Think upon thy sins with great displeasure and\nsorrow, and never think thyself anything because of thy good works.\nVerily thou art a sinner, liable to many passions, yea, tied and bound\nwith them. Of thyself thou always tendest unto nothing, thou wilt\nquickly fall, quickly be conquered, quickly disturbed, quickly undone.\nThou hast nought whereof to glory, but many reasons why thou shouldest\nreckon thyself vile, for thou art far weaker than thou art able to\ncomprehend.\n4. “Let, therefore, nothing which thou doest seem to thee great; let\nnothing be grand, nothing of value or beauty, nothing worthy of honour,\nnothing lofty, nothing praiseworthy or desirable, save what is eternal.\nLet the eternal truth please thee above all things, let thine own great\nvileness displease thee continually. Fear, denounce, flee nothing so\nmuch as thine own faults and sins, which ought to be more displeasing\nto thee than any loss whatsoever of goods. There are some who walk not\nsincerely before me, but being led by curiosity and pride, they desire\nto know my secret things and to understand the deep things of God,\nwhilst they neglect themselves and their salvation. These often fall\ninto great temptations and sins because of their pride and curiosity,\nfor I am against them.\n5. “Fear thou the judgments of God, fear greatly the wrath of the\nAlmighty. Shrink from debating upon the works of the Most High, but\nsearch narrowly thine own iniquities into what great sins thou hast\nfallen, and how many good things thou hast neglected. There are some\nwho carry their devotion only in books, some in pictures, some in\noutward signs and figures; some have Me in their mouths, but little in\ntheir hearts. Others there are who, being enlightened in their\nunderstanding and purged in their affections, continually long after\neternal things, hear of earthly things with unwillingness, obey the\nnecessities of nature with sorrow. And these understand what the Spirit\nof truth speaketh in them; for He teacheth them to despise earthly\nthings and to love heavenly; to neglect the world and to desire heaven\nall the day and night.”"

O, Father of\nMercies and God of all comfort,(1) I give thanks unto Thee, who\nrefreshest me sometimes with thine own comfort, when I am unworthy of\nany comfort. I bless and glorify Thee continually, with thine only\nbegotten Son and the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, for ever and ever. O\nLord God, Holy lover of my soul, when Thou shalt come into my heart,\nall my inward parts shall rejoice. Thou art my glory and the joy of my\nheart. Thou art my hope and my refuge in the day of my trouble.\n2. But because I am still weak in love and imperfect in virtue, I need\nto be strengthened and comforted by Thee; therefore visit Thou me often\nand instruct me with Thy holy ways of discipline. Deliver me from evil\npassions, and cleanse my heart from all inordinate affections, that,\nbeing healed and altogether cleansed within, I may be made ready to\nlove, strong to suffer, steadfast to endure.\n3. Love is a great thing, a good above all others, which alone maketh\nevery heavy burden light, and equaliseth every inequality. For it\nbeareth the burden and maketh it no burden, it maketh every bitter\nthing to be sweet and of good taste. The surpassing love of Jesus\nimpelleth to great works, and exciteth to the continual desiring of\ngreater perfection. Love willeth to be raised up, and not to be held\ndown by any mean thing. Love willeth to be free and aloof from all\nworldly affection, lest its inward power of vision be hindered, lest it\nbe entangled by any worldly prosperity or overcome by adversity.\nNothing is sweeter than love, nothing stronger, nothing loftier,\nnothing broader, nothing pleasanter, nothing fuller or better in heaven\nnor on earth, for love was born of God and cannot rest save in God\nabove all created things.\n4. He who loveth flyeth, runneth, and is glad; he is free and not\nhindered. He giveth all things for all things, and hath all things in\nall things, because he resteth in One who is high above all, from whom\nevery good floweth and proceedeth. He looketh not for gifts, but\nturneth himself to the Giver above all good things. Love oftentimes\nknoweth no measure, but breaketh out above all measure; love feeleth no\nburden, reckoneth not labours, striveth after more than it is able to\ndo, pleadeth not impossibility, because it judgeth all things which are\nlawful for it to be possible. It is strong therefore for all things,\nand it fulfilleth many things, and is successful where he who loveth\nnot faileth and lieth down.\n5. Love is watchful, and whilst sleeping still keepeth watch; though\nfatigued it is not weary, though pressed it is not forced, though\nalarmed it is not terrified, but like the living flame and the burning\ntorch, it breaketh forth on high and securely triumpheth. If a man\nloveth, he knoweth what this voice crieth. For the ardent affection of\nthe soul is a great clamour in the ears of God, and it saith: My God,\nmy Beloved! Thou art all mine, and I am all Thine.\n6. Enlarge Thou me in love, that I may learn to taste with the\ninnermost mouth of my heart how sweet it is to love, to be dissolved,\nand to swim in love. Let me be holden by love, mounting above myself\nthrough exceeding fervour and admiration. Let me sing the song of love,\nlet me follow Thee my Beloved on high, let my soul exhaust itself in\nThy praise, exulting with love. Let me love Thee more than myself, not\nloving myself except for Thy sake, and all men in Thee who truly love\nThee, as the law of love commandeth which shineth forth from Thee.\n7. Love is swift, sincere, pious, pleasant, gentle, strong, patient,\nfaithful, prudent, long-suffering, manly, and never seeking her own;\nfor wheresoever a man seeketh his own, there he falleth from love. Love\nis circumspect, humble, and upright; not weak, not fickle, nor intent\non vain things; sober, chaste, steadfast, quiet, and guarded in all the\nsenses. Love is subject and obedient to all that are in authority, vile\nand lowly in its own sight, devout and grateful towards God, faithful\nand always trusting in Him even when God hideth His face, for without\nsorrow we cannot live in love.\n8. He who is not ready to suffer all things, and to conform to the will\nof the Beloved, is not worthy to be called a lover of God. It behoveth\nhim who loveth to embrace willingly all hard and bitter things for the\nBeloved’s sake, and not to be drawn away from Him because of any\ncontrary accidents.\n(1) 2 Corinthians i. 3."

Wherefore, O my Lord?\n3. “Because for a little opposition thou fallest away from thy\nundertakings, and too eagerly seekest after consolation. The strong\nlover standeth fast in temptations, and believeth not the evil\npersuasions of the enemy. As in prosperity I please him, so in\nadversity I do not displease.\n4. “The prudent lover considereth not the gift of the lover so much as\nthe love of the giver. He looketh for the affection more than the\nvalue, and setteth all gifts lower than the Beloved. The noble lover\nresteth not in the gift, but in Me above every gift.\n5. “All is not lost, though thou sometimes think of Me or of My saints,\nless than thou shouldest desire. That good and sweet affection which\nthou sometimes perceivest is the effect of present grace and some\nforetaste of the heavenly country; but hereon thou must not too much\ndepend, for it goeth and cometh. But to strive against the evil motions\nof the mind which come to us, and to resist the suggestions of the\ndevil, is a token of virtue and great merit.\n6. “Therefore let not strange fancies disturb thee, whencesoever they\narise. Bravely observe thy purpose and thy upright intentions towards\nGod. It is not an illusion when thou art sometimes suddenly carried\naway into rapture, and then suddenly art brought back to the wonted\nvanities of thy heart. For thou dost rather unwillingly undergo them\nthan cause them; and so long as they displease thee and thou strivest\nagainst them, it is a merit and no loss.\n7. “Know thou that thine old enemy altogether striveth to hinder thy\npursuit after good, and to deter thee from every godly exercise, to\nwit, the contemplation of the Saints, the pious remembrance of My\npassion, the profitable recollection of sin, the keeping of thy own\nheart, and the steadfast purpose to grow in virtue. He suggesteth to\nthee many evil thoughts, that he may work in thee weariness and terror,\nand so draw thee away from prayer and holy reading. Humble confession\ndispleaseth him, and if he were able he would make thee to cease from\nCommunion. Believe him not, nor heed him, though many a time he hath\nlaid for thee the snares of deceit. Account it to be from him, when he\nsuggesteth evil and unclean thoughts. Say unto him, ‘Depart unclean\nspirit; put on shame, miserable one; horribly unclean art thou, who\nbringest such things to mine ears. Depart from me, detestable deceiver;\nthou shalt have no part in me; but Jesus shall be with me, as a strong\nwarrior, and thou shalt stand confounded. Rather would I die and bear\nall suffering, than consent unto thee. Hold thy peace and be dumb; I\nwill not hear thee more, though thou plottest more snares against me.\nThe Lord is my light and my salvation: whom then shall I fear? Though a\nhost of men should rise up against me, yet shall not my heart be\nafraid. The Lord is my strength and my Redeemer.’(1)\n8. “Strive thou like a good soldier; and if sometimes thou fail through\nweakness, put on thy strength more bravely than before, trusting in My\nmore abundant grace, and take thou much heed of vain confidence and\npride. Because of it many are led into error, and sometimes fall into\nblindness well-nigh irremediable. Let this ruin of the proud, who\nfoolishly lift themselves up, be to thee for a warning and a continual\nexhortation to humility.”\n(1) Psalms xxvii. 1-3; xix. 14."

          "content": "Of hiding our grace under the guard of humility\n“My Son, it is better and safer for thee to hide the grace of devotion,\nand not to lift thyself up on high, nor to speak much thereof, nor to\nvalue it greatly; but rather to despise thyself, and to fear as though\nthis grace were given to one unworthy thereof. Nor must thou depend too\nmuch upon this feeling, for it can very quickly be turned into its\nopposite. Think when thou art in a state of grace how miserable and\npoor thou art wont to be without grace. Nor is there advance in\nspiritual life in this alone, that thou hast the grace of consolation,\nbut that thou humbly and unselfishly and patiently takest the\nwithdrawal thereof; so that thou cease not from the exercise of prayer,\nnor suffer thy other common duties to be in anywise neglected; rather\ndo thy task more readily, as though thou hadst gained more strength and\nknowledge; and do not altogether neglect thyself because of the dearth\nand anxiety of spirit which thou feelest.\n2. “For there are many who, when things have not gone prosperous with\nthem, become forthwith impatient or slothful. For the way of a man is\nnot in himself,(1) but it is God’s to give and to console, when He\nwill, and as much as He will, and whom He will, as it shall please Him,\nand no further. Some who were presumptuous because of the grace of\ndevotion within them, have destroyed themselves, because they would do\nmore than they were able, not considering the measure of their own\nlittleness, but rather following the impulse of the heart than the\njudgment of the reason. And because they presumed beyond what was\nwell-pleasing unto God, therefore they quickly lost grace. They became\npoor and were left vile, who had built for themselves their nest in\nheaven; so that being humbled and stricken with poverty, they might\nlearn not to fly with their own wings, but to put their trust under My\nfeathers. They who are as yet new and unskilled in the way of the Lord,\nunless they rule themselves after the counsel of the wise, may easily\nbe deceived and led away.\n3. “But if they wish to follow their own fancies rather than trust the\nexperience of others, the result will be very dangerous to them if they\nstill refuse to be drawn away from their own notion. Those who are wise\nin their own conceits, seldom patiently endure to be ruled by others.\nIt is better to have a small portion of wisdom with humility, and a\nslender understanding, than great treasures of sciences with vain\nself-esteem. It is better for thee to have less than much of what may\nmake thee proud. He doeth not very discreetly who giveth up himself\nentirely to joy, forgetting his former helplessness and the chaste fear\nof the Lord, which feareth to lose the grace offered. Nor is he very\nwise, after a manly sort, who in time of adversity, or any trouble\nwhatsoever, beareth himself too despairingly, and feeleth concerning Me\nless trustfully than he ought.\n4. “He who in time of peace willeth to be oversecure shall be often\nfound in time of war overdispirited and full of fears. If thou knewest\nalways how to continue humble and moderate in thyself, and to guide and\nrule thine own spirit well, thou wouldest not so quickly fall into\ndanger and mischief. It is good counsel that when fervour of spirit is\nkindled, thou shouldest meditate how it will be with thee when the\nlight is taken away. Which when it doth happen, remember that still the\nlight may return again, which I have taken away for a time for a\nwarning to thee, and also for mine own glory. Such a trial is often\nmore useful than if thou hadst always things prosperous according to\nthine own will.\n5. “For merits are not to be reckoned by this, that a man hath many\nvisions or consolations, or that he is skilled in the Scriptures, or\nthat he is placed in a high situation; but that he is grounded upon\ntrue humility and filled with divine charity, that he always purely and\nuprightly seeketh the honour of God, that he setteth not by himself,\nbut unfeignedly despiseth himself, and even rejoiceth to be despised\nand humbled by others more than to be honoured.”\n(1) Jeremiah x. 23."

No purity is secure, if Thou\nprotect it not. No self-keeping availeth, if Thy holy watching be not\nthere. For when we are left alone we are swallowed up and perish, but\nwhen we are visited, we are raised up, and we live. For indeed we are\nunstable, but are made strong through Thee; we grow cold, but are\nrekindled by Thee.\n3. Oh, how humbly and abjectly must I reckon of myself, how must I\nweigh it as nothing, if I seem to have nothing good! Oh, how profoundly\nought I to submit myself to Thy unfathomable judgments, O Lord, when I\nfind myself nothing else save nothing, and again nothing! Oh weight\nunmeasurable, oh ocean which cannot be crossed over, where I find\nnothing of myself save nothing altogether! Where, then, is the\nhiding-place of glory, where the confidence begotten of virtue? All\nvain-glory is swallowed up in the depths of Thy judgments against me.\n4.

Thou hast not yet resisted unto blood.(1) It is\nlittle which thou sufferest in comparison with those who have suffered\nso many things, have been so strongly tempted, so grievously troubled,\nso manywise proved and tried. Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind\nthe more grievous sufferings of others that thou mightest bear thy\nlesser ones more easily, and if they seem not to thee little, see that\nit is not thy impatience which is the cause of this. But whether they\nbe little or whether they be great, study to bear them all with\npatience.\n2. “So far as thou settest thyself to bear patiently, so far thou dost\nwisely and art deserving of the more merit; thou shalt also bear the\nmore easily if thy mind and habit are carefully trained hereunto. And\nsay not ‘I cannot bear these things from such a man, nor are things of\nthis kind to be borne by me, for he hath done me grievous harm and\nimputeth to me what I had never thought: but from another I will suffer\npatiently, such things as I see I ought to suffer.’ Foolish is such a\nthought as this, for it considereth not the virtue of patience, nor by\nwhom that virtue is to be crowned, but it rather weigheth persons and\noffences against self.\n3. “He is not truly patient who will only suffer as far as seemeth\nright to himself and from whom he pleaseth. But the truly patient man\nconsidereth not by what man he is tried, whether by one above him, or\nby an equal or inferior, whether by a good and holy man, or a perverse\nand unworthy; but indifferently from every creature, whatsoever or how\noften soever adversity happeneth to him, he gratefully accepteth all\nfrom the hand of God and counteth it great gain: for with God nothing\nwhich is borne for His sake, however small, shall lose its reward.\n4. “Be thou therefore ready for the fight if thou wilt have the\nvictory.

Without labour thou\ndrawest not near to rest, nor without fighting comest thou to victory.”\n5. Make possible to me, O Lord, by grace what seemeth impossible to me\nby nature. Thou knowest how little I am able to bear, and how quickly I\nam cast down when a like adversity riseth up against me. Whatsoever\ntrial of tribulation may come to me, may it become unto me pleasing and\nacceptable, for to suffer and be vexed for Thy sake is exceeding\nhealthful to the soul.\n(1) Hebrews xii. 4."

Wonderfully\nsmall sometimes is the matter whence a grievous temptation cometh, and\nwhilst I imagine myself safe for a little space; when I am not\nconsidering, I find myself often almost overcome by a little puff of\nwind.\n2.

This is what\nfrequently throweth me backward and confoundeth me before Thee, that I\nam so liable to fall, so weak to resist my passions. And though their\nassault is not altogether according to my will, it is violent and\ngrievous, and it altogether wearieth me to live thus daily in conflict.\nHerein is my infirmity made known to me, that hateful fancies always\nrush in far more easily than they depart.\n3. Oh that Thou, most mighty God of Israel, Lover of all faithful\nsouls, wouldst look upon the labour and sorrow of Thy servant, and give\nhim help in all things whereunto he striveth. Strengthen me with\nheavenly fortitude, lest the old man, this miserable flesh, not being\nyet fully subdued to the spirit, prevail to rule over me; against which\nI ought to strive so long as I remain in this most miserable life. Oh\nwhat a life is this, where tribulations and miseries cease not, where\nall things are full of snares and of enemies, for when one tribulation\nor temptation goeth, another cometh, yea, while the former conflict is\nyet raging others come more in number and unexpected.\n4. And how can the life of man be loved, seeing that it hath so many\nbitter things, that it is subjected to so many calamities and miseries.\nHow can it be even called life, when it produces so many deaths and\nplagues?

Yet I know and confess that I cannot render Thee due praises\nfor the least of Thy mercies. I am less than the least of all the good\nthings which Thou gavest me; and when I consider Thy majesty, my spirit\nfaileth because of the greatness thereof.\n2. All things which we have in the soul and in the body, and whatsoever\nthings we possess, whether outwardly or inwardly, naturally or\nsupernaturally, are Thy good gifts, and prove Thee, from whom we have\nreceived them all, to be good, gentle, and kind. Although one receiveth\nmany things, and another fewer, yet all are Thine, and without Thee not\neven the least thing can be possessed. He who hath received greater\ncannot boast that it is of his own merit, nor lift himself up above\nothers, nor contemn those beneath him; for he is the greater and the\nbetter who ascribeth least to himself, and in giving thanks is the\nhumbler and more devout; and he who holdeth himself to be viler than\nall, and judgeth himself to be the more unworthy, is the apter for\nreceiving greater things.\n3. But he who hath received fewer gifts, ought not to be cast down, nor\nto take it amiss, nor to envy him who is richer; but rather ought he to\nlook unto Thee, and to greatly extol Thy goodness, for Thou pourest\nforth Thy gifts so richly, so freely and largely, without respect of\npersons. All things come of Thee; therefore in all things shalt thou be\npraised. Thou knowest what is best to be given to each; and why this\nman hath less, and that more, is not for us but for Thee to understand,\nfor unto Thee each man’s deservings are fully known.\n4. Wherefore, O Lord God, I reckon it even a great benefit, not to have\nmany things, whence praise and glory may appear outwardly, and after\nthe thought of men. For so it is that he who considereth his own\npoverty and vileness, ought not only to draw therefrom no grief or\nsorrow, or sadness of spirit, but rather comfort and cheerfulness;\nbecause Thou, Lord, hast chosen the poor and humble, and those who are\npoor in this world, to be Thy friends and acquaintance. So give all\nThine apostles witness whom Thou hast made princes in all lands. Yet\nthey had their conversation in this world blameless, so humble and\nmeek, without any malice or deceit, that they even rejoiced to suffer\nrebukes for Thy Name’s sake,(1) and what things the world hateth, they\nembraced with great joy.\n5. Therefore ought nothing so much to rejoice him who loveth Thee and\nknoweth Thy benefits, as Thy will in him, and the good pleasure of\nThine eternal Providence, wherewith he ought to be so contented and\ncomforted, that he would as willingly be the least as any other would\nbe the greatest, as peaceable and contented in the lowest as in the\nhighest place, and as willingly held of small and low account and of no\nname or reputation as to be more honourable and greater in the world\nthan others.

But, moreover, judge nothing\nrashly concerning the words or deeds of others, nor meddle with matters\nwhich are not committed to thee; and it may be that thou shalt be\ndisturbed little or rarely. Yet never to feel any disquiet, nor to\nsuffer any pain of heart or body, this belongeth not to the present\nlife, but is the state of eternal rest. Therefore count not thyself to\nhave found true peace, if thou hast felt no grief; nor that then all is\nwell if thou hast no adversary; nor that this is perfect if all things\nfall out according to thy desire. Nor then reckon thyself to be\nanything great, or think that thou art specially beloved, if thou art\nin a state of great fervour and sweetness of spirit; for not by these\nthings is the true lover of virtue known, nor in them doth the profit\nand perfection of man consist.”\n4. In what then, Lord?\n5. “In offering thyself with all thy heart to the Divine Will, in not\nseeking the things which are thine own, whether great or small, whether\ntemporal or eternal; so that thou remain with the same steady\ncountenance in giving of thanks between prosperity and adversity,\nweighing all things in an equal balance. If thou be so brave and\nlong-suffering in hope that when inward comfort is taken from thee,\nthou even prepare thy heart for the more endurance, and justify not\nthyself, as though thou oughtest not to suffer these heavy things, but\ndost justify Me in all things that I appoint, and dost bless My Holy\nName, then dost thou walk in the true and right way of peace, and shalt\nhave a sure hope that thou shalt again behold My face with joy. For if\nthou come to an utter contempt of thyself, know that then thou shalt\nenjoy abundance of peace, as much as is possible where thou art but a\nwayfaring man.”\n(1) John xiv. 27."

Therefore let not thy\nheart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Believe in Me, and put thy\ntrust in My mercy.(3) When thou thinkest thyself far removed from Me, I\nam often the nearer. When thou reckonest that almost all is lost, then\noften is greater opportunity of gain at hand. All is not lost when\nsomething goeth contrary to thy wishes.

What is more peaceful than the single eye?\nAnd what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth? Therefore\nmust a man rise above every creature, and perfectly forsake himself,\nand with abstracted mind to stand and behold that Thou, the Creator of\nall things, hast among Thy creatures nothing like unto Thyself.

Therefore few are found who give themselves\nto contemplation, because few know how to separate themselves entirely\nfrom perishing and created things.\n2. For this much grace is necessary, which may lift up the soul and\nraise it above itself. And except a man be lifted up in the spirit, and\nfreed from all creatures, and altogether united to God, whatsoever he\nknoweth, whatsoever even he hath, it mattereth but little. He who\nesteemeth anything great save the one only incomprehensible, eternal,\ngood, shall long time be little and lie low. For whatsoever is not God\nis nothing, and ought to be counted for nothing. Great is the\ndifference between a godly man, illuminated with wisdom, and a scholar\nlearned in knowledge and given to books. Far nobler is that doctrine\nwhich floweth down from the divine fulness above, than that which is\nacquired laboriously by human study.\n3. Many are found who desire contemplation, but they do not strive to\npractice those things which are required thereunto. It is also a great\nimpediment, that much is made of symbols and external signs, and too\nlittle of thorough mortification.

Ah, me! Forthwith after a little recollection we rush out of doors,\nand do not subject our actions to a strict examination. Where our\naffections are set we take no heed, and we weep not that all things\nbelonging to us are so defiled. For because all flesh had corrupted\nitself upon the earth, the great deluge came. Since therefore our\ninmost affections are very corrupt, it followeth of necessity that our\nactions also are corrupt, being the index of a deficient inward\nstrength. Out of a pure heart proceedeth the fruit of good living.\n5. We demand, how much a man hath done; but from how much virtue he\nacted, is not so narrowly considered. We ask if he be strong, rich,\nhandsome, clever, whether he is a good writer, good singer, good\nworkman; but how poor he may be in spirit, how patient and gentle, how\ndevout and meditative, on these things many are silent. Nature looketh\nupon the outward appearance of a man, grace turneth its thought to the\nheart. The former frequently judgeth amiss; the latter trusteth in God,\nthat it may not be deceived."

Thou shalt have liberty\nof heart, and the darkness shall not overwhelm thee. For this strive\nthou, pray for it, long after it, that thou mayest be delivered from\nall possession of thyself, and nakedly follow Jesus who was made naked\nfor thee; mayest die unto thyself and live eternally to Me.

For not by thine own meditating or\nstriving dost thou receive this gift, but by the sole gracious\ncondescension of Supreme Grace and Divine regard; to the end that thou\nmayest make progress in virtue and in more humility, and prepare\nthyself for future conflicts, and cleave unto Me with all the affection\nof thy heart, and strive to serve Me with fervent will.\n2. “My Son, often the fire burneth, but the flame ascendeth not without\nsmoke. So also the desires of some men burn towards heavenly things,\nand yet they are not free from the temptation of carnal affection. Thus\ntherefore they are not acting with an altogether simple desire for\nGod’s glory when they pray to Him so earnestly. Such, too, is\noftentimes thy desire, when thou hast imagined it to be so earnest. For\nthat is not pure and perfect which is tainted with thine own\nself-seeking.\n3. “Seek thou not what is pleasant and advantageous to thyself, but\nwhat is acceptable and honourable unto Me; for if thou judgest rightly,\nthou must choose and follow after My appointment rather than thine own\ndesire; yea, rather than anything that can be desired. I know thy\ndesire, and I have heard thy many groanings. Already thou longest to be\nin the glorious liberty of the children of God; already the eternal\nhome delighteth thee, and the heavenly country full of joy; but the\nhour is not yet come; there remaineth still another season, even a\nseason of warfare, a season of labour and probation. Thou desirest to\nbe filled with the Chief Good, but thou canst not attain it\nimmediately. I AM that Good; wait for Me, until the Kingdom of God\nshall come.\n4. “Thou must still be tried upon earth, and be exercised in many\nthings. Consolation shall from time to time be given thee, but abundant\nsatisfying shall not be granted. Be strong therefore, and be thou brave\nboth in working and in suffering things which are against thy nature.\nThou must put on the new man, and be changed into another man. Thou\nmust often do what thou wouldst not; and thou must leave undone what\nthou wouldst do. What pleaseth others shall have good success, what\npleaseth thee shall have no prosperity. What others say shall be\nlistened to; what thou sayest shall receive no heed. Others shall ask\nand receive; thou shalt ask and not obtain. Others shall be great in\nthe report of men, but about thee shall nothing be spoken. To others\nthis or that shall be entrusted; thou shalt be judged useful for\nnought.\n5. “For this cause nature shall sometimes be filled with sadness; and\nit is a great thing if thou bear it silently. In this and many like\nthings the faithful servant of the Lord is wont to be tried, how far he\nis able to deny himself and bring himself into subjection in all\nthings. Scarcely is there anything in which thou hast need to mortify\nthyself so much as in seeing things which are adverse to thy will;\nespecially when things are commanded thee to be done which seem to thee\ninexpedient or of little use to thee. And because thou darest not\nresist a higher power, being under authority, therefore it seemeth hard\nfor thee to shape thy course according to the nod of another, and to\nforego thine own opinion.\n6. “But consider, My Son, the fruit of these labours, the swift end,\nand the reward exceeding great; and thou shalt find it no pain to bear\nthem then, but rather the strongest solace of thy patience. For even in\nexchange for this trifling desire which thou hast readily forsaken,\nthou shalt always have thy will in Heaven. There verily thou shalt find\nall that thou wouldst, all that thou canst long for. There thou shalt\nhave all good within thy power without the fear of losing it. There thy\nwill, ever at one with Mine, shall desire nothing outward, nothing for\nitself. There no man shall withstand thee, none shall complain of thee,\nnone shall hinder, nothing shall stand in thy path; but all things\ndesired by thee shall be present together, and shall refresh thy whole\naffection, and fill it up even to the brim. There I will glory for the\nscorn suffered here, the garment of praise for sorrow, and for the\nlowest place a throne in the Kingdom, for ever. There shall appear the\nfruit of obedience, the labour of repentance shall rejoice, and humble\nsubjection shall be crowned gloriously.\n7. “Now therefore bow thyself humbly under the hands of all men; nor\nlet it trouble thee who said this or who ordered that; but take special\nheed that whether thy superior, thy inferior, or thy equal, require\nanything from thee, or even show a desire for it; take it all in good\npart, and study with a good will to fulfil the desire. Let one seek\nthis, another that; let this man glory in this, and that man in that,\nand be praised a thousand thousand times, but rejoice thou only in the\ncontempt of thyself, and in Mine own good pleasure and glory. This is\nwhat thou art to long for, even that whether by life or by death God\nmay be ever magnified in thee.”(1)\n(1) Philippians i. 20."

What hath Thy servant, which he received not from Thee,\neven without merit of his own? Thine are all things which Thou hast\ngiven, and which Thou hast made. I am poor and in misery even from my\nyouth up,(1) and my soul is sorrowful unto tears, sometimes also it is\ndisquieted within itself, because of the sufferings which are coming\nupon it.\n2. I long after the joy of peace; for the peace of Thy children do I\nbeseech, for in the light of Thy comfort they are fed by Thee. If Thou\ngive peace, if Thou pour into me holy joy, the soul of Thy servant\nshall be full of melody, and devout in Thy praise. But if Thou withdraw\nThyself as too often Thou art wont, he will not be able to run in the\nway of Thy commandments, but rather he will smite his breast and will\nbow his knees; because it is not with him as yesterday and the day\nbefore, when _Thy candle shined upon his head_,(2) and _he walked under\nthe shadow of Thy wings_,(3) from the temptations which beset him.\n3. O Father, righteous and ever to be praised, the hour cometh when Thy\nservant is to be proved. O beloved Father, it is well that in this hour\nThy servant suffer somewhat for Thy sake. O Father, evermore to be\nadored, as the hour cometh which Thou foreknewest from everlasting,\nwhen for a little while Thy servant should outwardly bow down, but\nalways live inwardly with Thee; when for a little while he should be\nlittle regarded, humbled, and fail in the eyes of men; should be wasted\nwith sufferings and weaknesses, to rise again with Thee in the dawn of\nthe new light, and be glorified in the heavenly places. O Holy Father,\nthou hast ordained it so, and so hast willed it; and that is done which\nThou Thyself hast commanded.\n4. For this is Thy favour to Thy friend, that he should suffer and be\ntroubled in the world for Thy love’s sake, how often soever, and by\nwhomsoever and whosoever Thou hast suffered it to be done. Without Thy\ncounsel and providence, and without cause, nothing cometh to pass on\nthe earth. It is good for me, Lord, that I had been in trouble, that I\nmay learn Thy statutes,(4) and may cast away all pride of heart and\npresumption. It is profitable for me that confusion hath covered my\nface, that I may seek to Thee for consolation rather than unto men. By\nthis also I have learned to dread Thine unsearchable judgment, who\nafflictest the just with the wicked, but not without equity and\njustice.\n5. Thanks be unto Thee, because Thou hast not spared my sins, but hast\nbeaten me with stripes of love, inflicting pains, and sending troubles\nupon me without and within. There is none who can console me, of all\nthings which are under heaven, but Thou only, O Lord my God, Thou\nheavenly Physician of souls, who dost scourge and hast mercy, who\nleadest down to hell and bringest up again.(5) Thy discipline over me,\nand Thy rod itself shall teach me.\n6. Behold, O beloved Father, I am in Thy hands, I bow myself under the\nrod of Thy correction. Smite my back and my neck that I may bend my\ncrookedness to Thy will. Make me a pious and lowly disciple, as Thou\nwert wont to be kind, that I may walk according to every nod of Thine.\nTo Thee I commend myself and all that I have for correction; better is\nit to be punished here than hereafter. Thou knowest all things and each\nof them; and nothing remaineth hid from Thee in man’s conscience.\nBefore they are, thou knowest that they will be, and Thou needest not\nthat any man teach Thee or admonish Thee concerning the things which\nare done upon the earth. Thou knowest what is expedient for my profit,\nand how greatly trouble serveth unto the scrubbing off the rust of sin.\nDo with me according to Thy desired good pleasure, and despise not my\nlife which is full of sin, known to none so entirely and fully as to\nThee alone.\n7. Grant me, O Lord, to know that which ought to be known; to love that\nwhich ought to be loved; to praise that which pleaseth Thee most, to\nesteem that which is precious in Thy sight, to blame that which is vile\nin Thine eyes. Suffer me not to judge according to the sight of bodily\neyes, nor to give sentence according to the hearing of the ears of\nignorant men; but to discern in true judgment between visible and\nspiritual things, and above all things to be ever seeking after the\nwill of Thy good pleasure.\n8.

For if I were able to pour forth tears\nlike the sea, still should I not be worthy of Thy consolation.\nTherefore am I nothing worthy save to be scourged and punished, because\nI have grievously and many a time offended Thee, and in many things\nhave greatly sinned. Therefore, true account being taken, I am not\nworthy even of the least of Thy consolations. But Thou, gracious and\nmerciful God, who willest not that Thy works should perish, to show\nforth the riches of Thy mercy upon the vessels of mercy,(1) vouchsafest\neven beyond all his own deserving, to comfort Thy servant above the\nmeasure of mankind. For Thy consolations are not like unto the\ndiscoursings of men.\n2. What have I done, O Lord, that Thou shouldst bestow any heavenly\ncomfort upon me? I remember not that I have done any good, but have\nbeen ever prone to sin and slow to amendment. It is true and I cannot\ndeny it. If I should say otherwise, Thou wouldst rise up against me,\nand there would be none to defend me. What have I deserved for my sins\nbut hell and everlasting fire? In very truth I confess that I am worthy\nof all scorn and contempt, nor is it fit that I should be remembered\namong Thy faithful servants.

Therefore thou\noughtest to cast away all things which hinder grace, if thou longest to\nreceive the inpouring thereof. Seek a secret place for thyself, love to\ndwell alone with thyself, desire the conversation of no one; but rather\npour out thy devout prayer to God, that thou mayest possess a contrite\nmind and a pure conscience.

All men\nindeed seek good, and make pretence of something good in all that they\nsay or do; and thus under the appearance of good many are deceived.\n2. “Nature is deceitful and draweth away, ensnareth, and deceiveth\nmany, and always hath self for her end; but Grace walketh in simplicity\nand turneth away from every appearance of evil, maketh no false\npretences, and doeth all entirely for the sake of God, in whom also she\nfinally resteth.\n3. “Nature is very unwilling to die, and to be pressed down, and to be\novercome, and to be in subjection, and to bear the yoke readily; but\nGrace studieth self-mortification, resisteth sensuality, seeketh to be\nsubdued, longeth to be conquered, and willeth not to use her own\nliberty. She loveth to be held by discipline, and not to have authority\nover any, but always to live, to remain, to have her being under God,\nand for God’s sake is ready to be humbly subject to every ordinance of\nman.\n4. “Nature laboureth for her own advantage, and considereth what profit\nshe may gain from another; but Grace considereth more, not what may be\nuseful and convenient to self, but what may be profitable to the many.\n5. “Nature willingly receiveth honour and reverence; but Grace\nfaithfully ascribeth all honour and glory to God.\n6. “Nature feareth confusion and contempt, but Grace rejoiceth to\nsuffer shame for the name of Jesus.\n7. “Nature loveth ease and bodily quiet; Grace cannot be unemployed,\nbut gladly embraceth labour.\n8. “Nature seeketh to possess things curious and attractive, and\nabhorreth those which are rough and cheap; Grace is delighted with\nthings simple and humble, despiseth not those which are rough, nor\nrefuseth to be clothed with old garments.\n9. “Nature hath regard to things temporal, rejoiceth in earthly lucre,\nis made sad by loss, vexed by any little injurious word; but Grace\nreacheth after things eternal, cleaveth not to those which are\ntemporal, is not perturbed by losses, nor embittered by any hard words,\nbecause she hath placed her treasure and joy in heaven where nought\nperisheth.\n10. “Nature is covetous, and receiveth more willingly than she giveth,\nloveth things that are personal and private to herself; while Grace is\nkind and generous, avoideth selfishness, is contented with a little,\nbelieveth that it is more blessed to give than to receive.\n11. “Nature inclineth thee to created things, to thine own flesh, to\nvanities and dissipation; but Grace draweth to God and to virtues,\nrenounceth creatures, fleeth from the world, hateth the desires of the\nflesh, restraineth vagaries, blusheth to be seen in public.\n12. “Nature is glad to receive some outward solace in which the senses\nmay have delight; but Grace seeketh to be comforted in God alone, and\nto have delight in the chief good above all visible things.\n13. “Nature doeth everything for her own gain and profit, can do\nnothing as a free favour, but hopeth to attain something as good or\nbetter, or some praise or favour for her benefits; and she loveth that\nher own deeds and gifts should be highly valued; but Grace seeketh\nnothing temporal, nor requireth any other gift of reward than God\nalone; neither longeth she for more of temporal necessities than such\nas may suffice for the attaining of eternal life.\n14. “Nature rejoiceth in many friends and kinsfolk, she boasteth of\nnoble place and noble birth, she smileth on the powerful, flattereth\nthe rich, applaudeth those who are like herself; but Grace loveth even\nher enemies, and is not lifted up by the multitude of friends, setteth\nno store upon high place or high birth, unless there be greater virtue\ntherewith; favoureth the poor man more than the rich, hath more\nsympathy with the innocent than with the powerful; rejoiceth with the\ntruthful, not with the liar; always exhorteth the good to strive after\nbetter gifts of grace, and to become by holiness like unto the Son of\nGod.\n15. “Nature quickly complaineth of poverty and of trouble; Grace\nbeareth want with constancy.\n16. “Nature looketh upon all things in reference to herself; striveth\nand argueth for self; but Grace bringeth back all things to God from\nwhom they came at the beginning; ascribeth no good to herself nor\narrogantly presumeth; is not contentious, nor preferreth her own\nopinion to others, but in every sense and understanding submitteth\nherself to the Eternal wisdom and the Divine judgment.\n17. “Nature is eager to know secrets and to hear new things; she loveth\nto appear abroad, and to make experience of many things through the\nsenses; she desireth to be acknowledged and to do those things which\nwin praise and admiration; but Grace careth not to gather up new or\ncurious things, because all this springeth from the old corruption,\nwhereas there is nothing new or lasting upon earth. So she teacheth to\nrestrain the senses, to shun vain complacency and ostentation, to hide\nhumbly those things which merit praise and real admiration, and from\neverything and in all knowledge to seek after useful fruit, and the\npraise and honour of God. She desireth not to receive praise for\nherself or her own, but longeth that God be blessed in all His gifts,\nwho out of unmingled love bestoweth all things.”\n18. This Grace is a supernatural light, and a certain special gift of\nGod, and the proper mark of the elect, and the pledge of eternal\nsalvation; it exalteth a man from earthly things to love those that are\nheavenly; and it maketh the carnal man spiritual. So far therefore as\nNature is utterly pressed down and overcome, so far is greater Grace\nbestowed and the inner man is daily created anew by fresh visitations,\nafter the image of God."

For I feel in my flesh the\nlaw of sin, contradicting the law of my mind, and bringing me into\ncaptivity to the obedience of sensuality in many things; nor can I\nresist its passions, unless Thy most holy grace assist me, fervently\npoured into my heart.\n2. There is need of Thy grace, yea, and of a great measure thereof,\nthat my nature may be conquered, which hath alway been prone to evil\nfrom my youth. For being fallen through the first man Adam, and\ncorrupted through sin, the punishment of this stain descended upon all\nmen; so that Nature itself, which was framed good and right by Thee, is\nnow used to express the vice and infirmity of corrupted Nature; because\nits motion left unto itself draweth men away to evil and to lower\nthings. For the little power which remaineth is as it were one spark\nlying hid in the ashes. This is Natural reason itself, encompassed with\nthick clouds, having yet a discernment of good and evil, a distinction\nof the true and the false, though it be powerless to fulfil all that it\napproveth, and possess not yet the full light of truth, nor\nhealthfulness of its affections.\n3. Hence it is, O my God, that I delight in Thy law after the inward\nman,(1) knowing that Thy commandment is holy and just and good;\nreproving also all evil, and the sin that is to be avoided: yet with\nthe flesh I serve the law of sin, whilst I obey sensuality rather than\nreason. Hence it is that to will to do good is present with me, but how\nto perform it I find not.(2) Hence I ofttimes purpose many good things;\nbut because grace is lacking to help mine infirmities, I fall back\nbefore a little resistance and fail. Hence it cometh to pass that I\nrecognize the way of perfectness, and see very clearly what things I\nought to do; but pressed down by the weight of my own corruption, I\nrise not to the things which are more perfect.\n4. Oh how entirely necessary is Thy grace to me, O Lord, for a good\nbeginning, for progress, and for bringing to perfection. For without it\nI can do nothing, but I can do all things through Thy grace which\nstrengtheneth me.(3) O truly heavenly grace, without which our own\nmerits are nought, and no gifts of Nature at all are to be esteemed.\nArts, riches, beauty, strength, wit, eloquence, they all avail nothing\nbefore Thee, O Lord, without Thy grace. For the gifts of Nature belong\nto good and evil alike; but the proper gift of the elect is grace—that\nis, love—and they who bear the mark thereof are held worthy of\neverlasting life. So mighty is this grace, that without it neither the\ngift of prophecy nor the working of miracles, nor any speculation,\nhowsoever lofty, is of any value at all. But neither faith, nor hope,\nnor any other virtue is accepted with Thee without love and grace.\n5. O most blessed grace that makest the poor in spirit rich in virtues,\nand renderest him who is rich in many things humble in spirit, come\nThou, descend upon me, fill me early with Thy consolation, lest my soul\nfail through weariness and drought of mind. I beseech thee, O Lord,\nthat I may find grace in Thy sight, for Thy grace is sufficient for\nme,(4) when I obtain not those things which Nature longeth for. If I be\ntempted and vexed with many tribulations, I will fear no evil, while\nThy grace remaineth with me. This alone is my strength, this bringeth\nme counsel and help. It is more powerful than all enemies, and wiser\nthan all the wise men in the world.\n6. It is the mistress of truth, the teacher of discipline, the light of\nthe heart, the solace of anxiety, the banisher of sorrow, the deliverer\nfrom fear, the nurse of devotion, the drawer forth of tears. What am I\nwithout it, save a dry tree, a useless branch, worthy to be cast away!\n“Let Thy grace, therefore, O Lord, always prevent and follow me, and\nmake me continually given to all good works, through Jesus Christ, Thy\nSon.

I have received the cross at Thy\nhand; I have carried it, and will carry it even unto death, as Thou\nhast laid it upon me. Truly the life of a truly devoted servant is a\ncross, but it leadeth to paradise. I have begun; I may not return back\nnor leave it.\n6. Come, my brothers, let us together go forward. Jesus shall be with\nus. For Jesus’ sake have we taken up this cross, for Jesus’ sake let us\npersevere in the cross. He will be our helper, who was our Captain and\nForerunner. Behold our King entereth in before us, and He will fight\nfor us.

But now suffer it to go by; it is not the\nfirst, it is not new, and it will not be the last, if thou live long.\nThou art brave enough, so long as no adversity meeteth thee. Thou\ngivest good counsel also, and knowest how to strengthen others with thy\nwords; but when tribulation suddenly knocketh at thine own door, thy\ncounsel and strength fail. Consider thy great frailty, which thou dost\nso often experience in trifling matters nevertheless, for thy soul’s\nhealth these things are done when they and such like happen unto thee.\n2. “Put them away from thy heart as well as thou canst, and if\ntribulation hath touched thee, yet let it not cast thee down nor\nentangle thee long. At the least, bear patiently, if thou canst not\njoyfully. And although thou be very unwilling to hear it, and feel\nindignation, yet check thyself, and suffer no unadvised word to come\nforth from thy lips, whereby the little ones may be offended. Soon the\nstorm which hath been raised shall be stilled, and inward grief shall\nbe sweetened by returning grace. I yet live, saith the Lord, ready to\nhelp thee, and to give thee more than wonted consolation if thou put\nthy trust in Me, and call devoutly upon Me.\n3. “Be thou more calm of spirit, and gird thyself for greater\nendurance. All is not frustrated, though thou find thyself very often\nafflicted or grievously tempted. Thou art man, not God; thou art flesh,\nnot an angel. How shouldst thou be able to remain alway in the same\nstate of virtue, when an angel in heaven fell, and the first man in\nparadise? I am He who lifteth up the mourners to deliverance, and those\nwho know their own infirmity I raise up to my own nature.”\n4. O Lord, blessed be Thy word, sweeter to my mouth than honey and the\nhoneycomb. What should I do in my so great tribulations and anxieties,\nunless Thou didst comfort me with Thy holy words? If only I may attain\nunto the haven of salvation, what matter is it what things or how many\nI suffer? Give me a good end, give me a happy passage out of this\nworld.

          "content": "Of deeper matters, and God’s hidden judgments which are not to be\ninquired into\n“My Son, beware thou dispute not of high matters and of the hidden\njudgments of God; why this man is thus left, and that man is taken into\nso great favour; why also this man is so greatly afflicted, and that so\nhighly exalted. These things pass all man’s power of judging, neither\nmay any reasoning or disputation have power to search out the divine\njudgments. When therefore the enemy suggesteth these things to thee, or\nwhen any curious people ask such questions, answer with that word of\nthe Prophet, _Just art Thou, O Lord, and true is Thy judgment_,(1) and\nwith this, _The judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous\naltogether_.(2) My judgments are to be feared, not to be disputed on,\nbecause they are incomprehensible to human understanding.\n2. “And be not given to inquire or dispute about the merits of the\nSaints, which is holier than another, or which is the greater in the\nKingdom of Heaven. Such questions often beget useless strifes and\ncontentions: they also nourish pride and vain glory, whence envyings\nand dissensions arise, while one man arrogantly endeavoureth to exalt\none Saint and another another. But to wish to know and search out such\nthings bringeth no fruit, but it rather displeaseth the Saints; for I\nam not _the God of confusion but of peace;_(3) which peace consisteth\nmore in true humility than in self-exaltation.\n3. “Some are drawn by zeal of love to greater affection to these Saints\nor those; but this is human affection rather than divine. I am He Who\nmade all the Saints: I gave them grace, I brought them glory; I know\nthe merits of every one; _I prevented them with the blessings of My\ngoodness_.(4) I foreknew my beloved ones from everlasting, _I chose\nthem out of the world;_(5) they did not choose Me. I called them by My\ngrace, drew them by My mercy, led them on through sundry temptations. I\npoured mighty consolations upon them, I gave them perseverance, I\ncrowned their patience.\n4. “I acknowledge the first and the last; I embrace all with\ninestimable love. I am to be praised in all My Saints; I am to be\nblessed above all things, and to be honoured in every one whom I have\nso gloriously exalted and predestined, without any preceding merits of\ntheir own. He therefore that shall despise one of the least of these My\npeople, honoureth not the great; because I made both small and\ngreat.(6) And he who speaketh against any of My Saints speaketh against\nMe, and against all others in the Kingdom of Heaven.”\nThey are all one through the bond of charity; they think the same\nthing, will the same thing, and all are united in love one to another.\n5. “But yet (which is far better) they love Me above themselves and\ntheir own merits. For being caught up above themselves, and drawn\nbeyond self-love, they go all straightforward to the love of Me, and\nthey rest in Me in perfect enjoyment. There is nothing which can turn\nthem away or press them down; for being full of Eternal Truth, they\nburn with the fire of inextinguishable charity. Therefore let all\ncarnal and natural men hold their peace concerning the state of the\nSaints, for they know nothing save to love their own personal\nenjoyment. They take away and add according to their own inclination,\nnot as it pleaseth the Eternal Truth.\n6. “In many men this is ignorance, chiefly is it so in those who, being\nlittle enlightened, rarely learn to love any one with perfect spiritual\nlove. They are still much drawn by natural affection and human\nfriendship to these or to those: and as they reckon of themselves in\nlower matters, so also do they frame imaginations of things heavenly.\nBut there is an immeasurable difference between those things which they\nimperfectly imagine, and these things which enlightened men behold\nthrough supernatural revelation.\n7. “Take heed, therefore, My son, that thou treat not curiously those\nthings which surpass thy knowledge, but rather make this thy business\nand give attention to it, namely, that thou seek to be found, even\nthough it be the least, in the Kingdom of God. And even if any one\nshould know who were holier than others, or who were held greatest in\nthe Kingdom of Heaven; what should that knowledge profit him, unless\nthrough this knowledge he should humble himself before Me, and should\nrise up to give greater praise unto My name? He who considereth how\ngreat are his own sins, how small his virtues, and how far he is\nremoved from the perfection of the Saints, doeth far more acceptably in\nthe sight of God, than he who disputeth about their greatness or\nlittleness.\n8. “They are altogether well content, if men would learn to be content,\nand to refrain from vain babbling. They glory not of their own merits,\nseeing they ascribe no good unto themselves, but all unto Me, seeing\nthat I of my infinite charity have given them all things. They are\nfilled with so great love of the Divinity, and with such overflowing\njoy, that no glory is lacking to them, neither can any felicity be\nlacking. All the Saints, the higher they are exalted in glory, the\nhumbler are they in themselves, and the nearer and dearer are they unto\nMe. And so thou hast it written that they cast their crowns before God\nand fell on their faces before the Lamb, and worshipped Him that liveth\nfor ever and ever.(7)\n9. “Many ask who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, who know not\nwhether they shall be worthy to be counted among the least. It is a\ngreat thing to be even the least in Heaven, where all are great,\nbecause all shall be called, and shall be, the sons of God. _A little\none shall become a thousand, but the sinner being an hundred years old\nshall be accursed_. For when the disciples asked _who should be the\ngreatest in the Kingdom of Heaven_, they received no other answer than\nthis, _Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall\nnot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. But whosoever shall humble\nhimself as this little child, the same shall be greatest in the Kingdom\nof Heaven_.”(8)\n10. Woe unto them who disdain to humble themselves willingly with the\nlittle children; for the low gate of the kingdom of Heaven will not\nsuffer them to enter in. Woe also to them who are rich, who have their\nconsolation here;(9) because whilst the poor enter into the kingdom of\nGod, they shall stand lamenting without. Rejoice ye humble, and exult\nye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God if only ye walk in the truth.\n(1) Psalm cxix. 137. (2) Psalm xix. 9. (3) 1 Corinthians xiv. 33. (4)\nPsalm xxi. 3.

I had rather be poor for Thy sake, than rich without Thee. I\nchoose rather to be a pilgrim upon the earth with Thee than without\nThee to possess heaven. Where Thou art, there is heaven; and where Thou\nare not, behold there death and hell. Thou art all my desire, and\ntherefore must I groan and cry and earnestly pray after Thee. In short\nI can confide fully in none to give me ready help in necessities, save\nin Thee alone, O my God. Thou art my hope, Thou art my trust, Thou art\nmy Comforter, and most faithful in all things.\n2. _All men seek their own;_(1) Thou settest forward only my salvation\nand my profit, and turnest all things unto my good. Even though Thou\ndost expose me to divers temptations and adversities, Thou ordainest\nall this unto my advantage, for Thou are wont to prove Thy beloved ones\nin a thousand ways. In which proving Thou oughtest no less to be loved\nand praised, than if Thou wert filling me full of heavenly\nconsolations.\n3. In Thee, therefore, O Lord God, I put all my hope and my refuge, on\nThee I lay all my tribulation and anguish; because I find all to be\nweak and unstable whatsoever I behold out of Thee. For many friends\nshall not profit, nor strong helpers be able to succour, nor prudent\ncounsellors to give a useful answer, nor the books of the learned to\nconsole, nor any precious substance to deliver, nor any secret and\nbeautiful place to give shelter, if Thou Thyself do not assist, help,\nstrengthen, comfort, instruct, keep in safety.\n4. For all things which seem to belong to the attainment of peace and\nfelicity are nothing when Thou art absent, and bring no felicity at all\nin reality.

Protect and\npreserve the soul of Thy least servant amid so many dangers of\ncorruptible life, and by Thy grace accompanying me, direct it by the\nway of peace unto its home of perpetual light.

          "content": "With how great reverence Christ must be received\nThe Voice of the Disciple\nThese are Thy words, O Christ, Eternal Truth; though not uttered at one\ntime nor written together in one place of Scripture. Because therefore\nthey are Thy words and true, I must gratefully and faithfully receive\nthem all. They are Thine, and Thou hast uttered them; and they are mine\nalso, because Thou didst speak them for my salvation. Gladly I receive\nthem from Thy mouth, that they may be more deeply implanted in my\nheart. Words of such great grace arouse me, for they are full of\nsweetness and love; but my own sins terrify me, and my impure\nconscience driveth me away from receiving so great mysteries. The\nsweetness of Thy words encourageth me, but the multitude of my faults\npresseth me down.\n2. Thou commandest that I draw near to Thee with firm confidence, if I\nwould have part with Thee, and that I receive the food of immortality,\nif I desire to obtain eternal life and glory. Come unto Me, sayest\nThou, all that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Oh,\nsweet and lovely word in the ear of the sinner, that Thou, O Lord my\nGod, dost invite the poor and needy to the Communion of Thy most holy\nbody and blood. But who am I, O Lord, that I should presume to approach\nunto Thee? Behold the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee, and yet\nThou sayest, Come ye all unto Me.\n3. What meaneth this most gracious condescension, this most lovely\ninvitation? How shall I dare to come, who know no good thing of myself,\nwhence I might be able to presume? How shall I bring Thee within my\nhouse, seeing that I so often have sinned in Thy most loving sight?\nAngels and Archangels stand in awe of Thee, the Saints and just men\nfear Thee, and Thou sayest, Come unto Me! Except Thou, Lord, hadst said\nit, who should believe it true? And except Thou hadst commanded, who\nshould attempt to draw near?\n4. Behold, Noah, that just man, laboured for a hundred years in\nbuilding the ark, that he might be saved with the few; and I, how shall\nI be able in one hour to prepare myself to receive the Builder of the\nworld with reverence? Moses, Thy servant, Thy great and especial\nfriend, made an ark of incorruptible wood, which also he covered with\npurest gold, that he might lay up in it the tables of the law, and I, a\ncorruptible creature, shall I dare thus easily to receive Thee, the\nMaker of the Law and the Giver of life? Solomon, the wisest of the\nkings of Israel, was seven years building his magnificent temple to the\npraise of Thy Name, and for eight days celebrated the feast of its\ndedication, offered a thousand peace offerings, and solemnly brought up\nthe Ark of the Covenant to the place prepared for it, with the sound of\ntrumpets and great joy, and I, unhappy and poorest of mankind, how\nshall I bring Thee into my house, who scarce know how to spend half an\nhour in devotion? And oh that it were even one half hour worthily\nspent!\n5. O my God, how earnestly these holy men strove to please Thee! And\nalas! how little and trifling is that which I do! how short a time do I\nspend, when I am disposing myself to Communion. Rarely altogether\ncollected, most rarely cleansed from all distraction. And surely in the\nsaving presence of Thy Godhead no unmeet thought ought to intrude, nor\nshould any creature take possession of me, because it is not an Angel\nbut the Lord of the Angels, that I am about to receive as my Guest.\n6. Yet there is a vast difference between the Ark of the Covenant with\nits relics, and Thy most pure Body with its ineffable virtues, between\nthose sacrifices of the law, which were figures of things to come, and\nthe true sacrifice of Thy Body, the completion of all the ancient\nsacrifices.\n7. Wherefore then do I not yearn more ardently after Thy adorable\npresence? Why do I not prepare myself with greater solicitude to\nreceive Thy holy things, when those holy Patriarchs and Prophets of\nold, kings also and princes, with the whole people, manifested so great\naffection of devotion towards Thy Divine Service?\n8. The most devout king David danced with all his might before the Ark\nof God, calling to mind the benefits granted to his forefathers in days\npast; he fashioned musical instruments of various sorts, put forth\nPsalms, and appointed them to be sung with joy, played also himself\nofttimes on the harp, being inspired with the grace of the Holy Ghost;\nhe taught the people of Israel to praise God with the whole heart, and\nwith unity of voice to bless and praise Him every day. If so great\ndevotion was then exercised, and celebration of divine praise was\ncarried on before the Ark of the Testimony, how great reverence and\ndevotion ought now to be shown by me and all Christian people at the\nministering of the Sacrament, at receiving the most precious Body and\nBlood of Christ.\n9. Many run to diverse places to visit the memorials of departed\nSaints, and rejoice to hear of their deeds and to look upon the\nbeautiful buildings of their shrines. And behold, Thou art present here\nwith me, O my God, Saint of Saints, Creator of men and Lord of the\nAngels. Often in looking at those memorials men are moved by curiosity\nand novelty, and very little fruit of amendment is borne away,\nespecially when there is so much careless trifling and so little true\ncontrition. But here in the Sacrament of the Altar, Thou art present\naltogether, My God, the Man Christ Jesus; where also abundant fruit of\neternal life is given to every one soever that receiveth Thee worthily\nand devoutly. But to this no levity draweth, no curiosity, nor\nsensuality, only steadfast faith, devout hope, and sincere charity.\n10. O God, invisible Creator of the world, how wondrously dost Thou\nwork with us, how sweetly and graciously Thou dealest with Thine elect,\nto whom Thou offerest Thyself to be received in this Sacrament! For\nthis surpasseth all understanding, this specially draweth the hearts of\nthe devout and enkindleth their affections. For even thy true faithful\nones themselves, who order their whole life to amendment, oftentimes\ngain from this most excellent Sacrament great grace of devotion and\nlove of virtue.\n11. Oh admirable and hidden grace of the Sacrament, which only Christ’s\nfaithful ones know, but the faithless and those who serve sin cannot\nexperience! In this Sacrament is conferred spiritual grace, and lost\nvirtue is regained in the soul, and the beauty which was disfigured by\nsin returneth again. So great sometimes is this grace that out of the\nfulness of devotion given, not only the mind but also the weak body\nfeeleth that more strength is supplied unto it.\n12. But greatly must we mourn and lament over our lukewarmness and\nnegligence, that we are not drawn by greater affection to become\npartakers of Christ, in whom all the hope and the merit of those that\nare to be saved consist. For He Himself is our sanctification and\nredemption.(1) He is the consolation of pilgrims and the eternal\nfruition of the Saints. Therefore it is grievously to be lamented that\nmany so little consider this health-giving mystery, which maketh heaven\nglad and preserveth the whole world. Alas for the blindness and\nhardness of man’s heart, that he considereth not more this unspeakable\ngift, and even slippeth down through the daily use, into carelessness.\n13. For if this most holy Sacrament were celebrated in one place only,\nand were consecrated only by one priest in the whole world, with what\ngreat desire thinkest thou, would men be affected towards that place\nand towards such a priest of God, that they might behold the divine\nmysteries celebrated? But now are many men made priests and in many\nplaces the Sacrament is celebrated, that the grace and love of God\ntowards men might the more appear, the more widely the Holy Communion\nis spread abroad over all the world. Thanks be unto Thee, O good Jesus,\nEternal Shepherd, who hast vouchsafed to refresh us, poor and exiled\nones, with Thy precious Body and Blood, and to invite us to partake\nthese holy mysteries by the invitation from Thine own mouth, saying,\nCome unto Me, ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh\nyou.\n(1) 1 Corinthians i. 30."

Therefore because this\npleaseth Thee and Thou hast commanded that thus it shall be, Thy\ncondescension pleaseth me also; and oh that mine iniquity hinder it\nnot.\n2.

Behold, Thou art the Saint of saints and I the refuse of sinners;\nbehold, Thou stoopest unto me who am not worthy to look upon Thee;\nbehold, Thou comest unto me, Thou willest to be with me, Thou invitest\nme to Thy feast. Thou willest to give me the heavenly food and bread of\nangels to eat; none other, in truth, than Thyself, The living bread,\nwhich didst descend from heaven; and givest life to the world.(1)\n4. Behold, whence this love proceedeth! what manner of condescension\nshineth forth herein. What great giving of thanks and praise is due\nunto Thee for these benefits! Oh how salutary and profitable Thy\npurpose when Thou didst ordain this! How sweet and pleasant the feast\nwhen Thou didst give Thyself for food! Oh how admirable is thy working,\nO Lord, how mighty Thy power, how unspeakable Thy truth! For Thou didst\nspeak the word, and all things were made; and this is done which Thou\nhast commanded.\n5. A thing wonderful, and worthy of faith, and surpassing all the\nunderstanding of man, that Thou, O Lord my God, very God and very man,\ngivest Thyself altogether to us in a little bread and wine, and art so\nour inexhaustible food. Thou, O Lord of all, who hast need of nothing,\nhast willed to dwell in us through Thy Sacrament. Preserve my heart and\nmy body undefiled, that with a joyful and pure conscience I may be able\nvery often to [celebrate, and](2) receive to my perpetual health. Thy\nmysteries, which Thou hast consecrated and instituted both for Thine\nown honour, and for a perpetual memorial.\n6. Rejoice, O my soul, and give thanks unto God for so great a gift and\nprecious consolation, left unto thee in this vale of tears. For so oft\nas thou callest this mystery to mind and receivest the body of Christ,\nso often dost thou celebrate the work of thy redemption, and art made\npartaker of all the merits of Christ. For the charity of Christ never\ngroweth less, and the greatness of His propitiation is never exhausted.\nTherefore, by continual renewal of thy spirit, thou oughtest to dispose\nthyself hereunto and to weigh the great mystery of salvation with\nattentive consideration. So great, new, and joyful ought it to appear\nto thee when thou comest to communion, as if on this self-same day\nChrist for the first time were descending into the Virgin’s womb and\nbecoming man, or hanging on the cross, suffering and dying for the\nsalvation of mankind.\n(1) John vi. 51.

Lighten also mine eyes to behold this so great mystery,\nand strengthen me that I may believe it with undoubting faith. For it\nis Thy word, not human power; it is Thy holy institution, not the\ninvention of man. For no man is found fit in himself to receive and to\nunderstand these things, which transcend even the wisdom of the Angels.\nWhat portion then shall I, unworthy sinner, who am but dust and ashes,\nbe able to search into and comprehend of so deep a Sacrament?\n2. O Lord, in the simplicity of my heart, in good and firm faith, and\naccording to Thy will, I draw nigh unto Thee with hope and reverence,\nand truly believe that Thou art here present in the Sacrament, God and\nman. Thou willest therefore that I receive Thee and unite myself to\nThee in charity. Wherefore I beseech Thy mercy, and implore Thee to\ngive me Thy special grace, to this end, that I may be wholly dissolved\nand overflow with love towards Thee, and no more suffer any other\nconsolation to enter into me. For this most high and most glorious\nSacrament is the health of the soul and the body, the medicine of all\nspiritual sickness, whereby I am healed of my sins, my passions are\nbridled, temptations are conquered or weakened, more grace is poured\ninto me, virtue begun is increased, faith is made firm, hope is\nstrengthened, and charity is enkindled and enlarged.\n3. For in this Sacrament Thou hast bestowed many good things and still\nbestowest them continually on Thine elect who communicate devoutly, O\nmy God, Lifter up of my soul, Repairer of human infirmity, and Giver of\nall inward consolation. For Thou pourest into them much consolation\nagainst all sorts of tribulation, and out of the deep of their own\nmisery Thou liftest them up to the hope of Thy protection, and with\never new grace, dost inwardly refresh and enlighten them; so that they\nwho felt themselves to be anxious and without affection before\nCommunion, afterwards being refreshed with heavenly food and drink,\nfind themselves changed for the better. And even in such wise Thou\ndealest severally with Thine elect, that they may truly acknowledge and\nclearly make proof that they have nothing whatsoever of their own, and\nwhat goodness and grace come to them from Thee; because being in\nthemselves cold, hard of heart, indevout, through Thee they become\nfervent, zealous, and devout. For who is there coming humbly to the\nfountain of sweetness, carrieth not away thence at the least some\nlittle of that sweetness? Or who standing by a large fire, feeleth not\nfrom thence a little of its heat? And Thou art ever a full and\noverflowing fountain, a fire continually burning, and never going out.\n4. Wherefore if it is not suffered to me to draw from the fulness of\nthe fountain, nor to drink unto satisfying, yet will I set my lips to\nthe mouth of the heavenly conduit, that at least I may receive a small\ndrop to quench my thirst, that I dry not up within my heart. And if I\nam not yet able to be altogether heavenly and so enkindled as the\nCherubim and Seraphim, yet will I endeavour to give myself unto\ndevotion, and to prepare my heart, that I may gain if it be but a\nlittle flame of the divine fire, through the humble receiving of the\nlife-giving Sacrament. But whatsoever is wanting unto me, O merciful\nJesus, Most Holy Saviour, do Thou of Thy kindness and grace supply, who\nhast vouchsafed to call all unto Thee, saying, Come unto me, all ye\nthat are weary and heavy laden, and I will refresh you.\n5. I indeed labour in the sweat of my face, I am tormented with sorrow\nof heart, I am burdened with sins, I am disquieted with temptations, I\nam entangled and oppressed with many passions, and there is none to\nhelp me, there is none to deliver and ease me, but Thou, O Lord God, my\nSaviour, to whom I commit myself and all things that are mine, that\nThou mayest preserve me and lead me unto life eternal.\nReceive me unto the praise and glory of Thy name, who hast prepared\nThy Body and Blood to be my meat and drink. Grant, O Lord God my\nSaviour, that with coming often to Thy mysteries the zeal of my\ndevotion may increase."

Vast is the mystery, and great is the dignity of the priests,\nto whom is given what is not granted to Angels. For priests only,\nrightly ordained in the church, have the power of consecrating and\ncelebrating the Body of Christ. The priest indeed is the minister of\nGod, using the Word of God by God’s command and institution;\nnevertheless God is there the principal Author and invisible Worker,\nthat to whom all that He willeth is subject, and all He commandeth is\nobedient.\n2. Therefore thou must believe God Almighty in this most excellent\nSacrament, more than thine own sense or any visible sign at all. And\ntherefore with fear and reverence is this work to be approached. Take\nheed therefore and see what it is of which the ministry is committed to\nthee by the laying on of the Bishop’s hand. Behold thou art made a\npriest and art consecrated to celebrate. See now that thou do it before\nGod faithfully and devoutly at due time, and shew thyself without\nblame. Thou hast not lightened thy burden, but art now bound with a\nstraiter bond of discipline, and art pledged to a higher degree of\nholiness. A priest ought to be adorned with all virtues and to afford\nto others an example of good life. His conversation must not be with\nthe popular and common ways of men, but with Angels in Heaven or with\nperfect men on earth.\n3. A priest clad in holy garments taketh Christ’s place that he may\npray unto God with all supplication and humility for himself and for\nthe whole people. He must always remember the Passion of Christ. He\nmust diligently look upon Christ’s footsteps and fervently endeavour\nhimself to follow them. He must bear meekly for God whatsoever ills are\nbrought upon him by others. He must mourn for his own sins, and for the\nsins committed by others, and may not grow careless of prayer and holy\noblation, until he prevail to obtain grace and mercy. When the priest\ncelebrateth, he honoureth God, giveth joy to the Angels, buildeth up\nthe Church, helpeth the living, hath communion with the departed, and\nmaketh himself a partaker of all good things."

The enemy, knowing what profit and exceeding strong remedy lieth\nin the Holy Communion, striveth by all means and occasions to draw back\nand hinder the faithful and devout, so far as he can.\n2. For when some set about to prepare themselves for Holy Communion,\nthey suffer from the more evil suggestions of Satan. The very evil\nspirit himself (as is written in Job), cometh among the sons of God\nthat he may trouble them by his accustomed evil dealing, or make them\nover timid and perplexed; to the intent that he may diminish their\naffections, or take away their faith by his attacks, if haply he may\nprevail upon them to give up Holy Communion altogether, or to come\nthereto with lukewarm hearts. But his wiles and delusions must not be\nheeded, howsoever wicked and terrible they be; but all his delusion\nmust be cast back upon his own head. The wretch must be despised and\nlaughed to scorn: neither must Holy Communion be omitted because of his\ninsults and the inward troubles which he stirreth up.\n3. Often also too much carefulness or some anxiety or other touching\nconfession hindereth from obtaining devotion. Do thou according to the\ncounsel of wise men, and lay aside anxiety and scruple, because it\nhindereth the grace of God and destroyeth devotion of mind. Because of\nsome little vexation or trouble do not thou neglect Holy Communion, but\nrather hasten to confess it, and forgive freely all offences committed\nagainst thee. And if thou hast offended any man, humbly beg for pardon,\nand God shall freely forgive thee.\n4. What profiteth it to put off for long time the confession of thy\nsins, or to defer Holy Communion? Cleanse thyself forthwith, spit out\nthe poison with all speed, hasten to take the remedy, and thou shalt\nfeel thyself better than if thou didst long defer it. If to-day thou\ndefer it on one account, to-morrow perchance some greater obstacle will\ncome, and so thou mayest be long time hindered from Communion and\nbecome more unfit. As soon as thou canst, shake thyself from thy\npresent heaviness and sloth, for it profiteth nothing to be long\nanxious, to go long on thy way with heaviness of heart, and because of\ndaily little obstacles to sever thyself from divine things: nay it is\nexceeding hurtful to defer thy Communion long, for this commonly\nbringeth on great torpor. Alas! there are some, lukewarm and\nundisciplined, who willingly find excuses for delaying repentance, and\ndesire to defer Holy Communion, lest they should be bound to keep\nstricter watch upon themselves.\n5. Alas! how little charity, what flagging devotion, have they who so\nlightly put off Holy Communion. How happy is he, how acceptable to God,\nwho so liveth, and in such purity of conscience keepeth himself, that\nany day he could be ready and well inclined to communicate, if it were\nin his power, and might be done without the notice of others. If a man\nsometimes abstaineth for the sake of humility or some sound cause, he\nis to be commended for his reverence. But if drowsiness have taken hold\nof him, he ought to rouse himself and to do what in him lieth; and the\nLord will help his desire for the good will which he hath, which God\nspecially approveth.\n6. But when he is hindered by sufficient cause, yet will he ever have a\ngood will and pious intention to communicate; and so he shall not be\nlacking in the fruit of the Sacrament. For any devout man is able every\nday and every hour to draw near to spiritual communion with Christ to\nhis soul’s health and without hindrance. Nevertheless on certain days\nand at the appointed time he ought to receive the Body and Blood of his\nRedeemer with affectionate reverence, and rather to seek after the\npraise and honour of God, than his own comfort. For so often doth he\ncommunicate mystically, and is invisibly refreshed, as he devoutly\ncalleth to mind the mystery of Christ’s incarnation and His Passion,\nand is inflamed with the love of Him.\n7. He who only prepareth himself when a festival is at hand or custom\ncompelleth, will too often be unprepared. Blessed is he who offereth\nhimself to God for a whole burnt-offering, so often as he celebrateth\nor communicateth! Be not too slow nor too hurried in thy celebrating,\nbut preserve the good received custom of those with whom thou livest.\nThou oughtest not to produce weariness and annoyance in others, but to\nobserve the received custom, according to the institution of the\nelders; and to minister to the profit of others rather than to thine\nown devotion or feeling."

And to me it would verily be sweet to\npour forth my tears in Thy presence from the very bottom of my heart,\nand with the pious Magdalene to water Thy feet with my tears. But where\nis this devotion? Where the abundant flowing of holy tears? Surely in\nThy presence and in the presence of the holy Angels my whole heart\nought to burn and to weep for joy; for I have Thee in the Sacrament\nverily present, although hidden under other form.\n2. For in Thine own Divine brightness, mine eyes could not endure to\nbehold Thee, neither could the whole world stand before the splendour\nof the glory of Thy Majesty.

When I think on these wondrous things, even spiritual comfort\nwhatsoever it be becometh sore weariness to me; for so long as I see\nnot openly my Lord in His own Glory, I count for nothing all which I\nbehold and hear in the world. Thou, O God, art my witness that nothing\nis able to comfort me, no creature is able to give me rest, save Thou,\nO my God, whom I desire to contemplate everlastingly. But this is not\npossible, so long as I remain in this mortal state. Therefore ought I\nto set myself unto great patience, and submit myself unto Thee in every\ndesire. For even Thy Saints, O Lord, who now rejoice with Thee in the\nkingdom of heaven, waited for the coming of Thy glory whilst they lived\nhere, in faith and great glory. What they believed, that believe I;\nwhat they hoped, I hope; whither they have attained to, thither through\nThy grace hope I to come. I will walk meanwhile in faith, strengthened\nby the examples of the Saints. I will have also holy books for comfort\nand for a mirror of life, and above them all Thy most holy Body and\nBlood shall be for me a special remedy and refuge.\n4. For two things do I feel to be exceedingly necessary to me in this\nlife, without which this miserable life would be intolerable to me;\nbeing detained in the prison of this body, I confess that I need two\nthings, even food and light. Thou hast therefore given to me who am so\nweak, Thy sacred Body and Blood, for the refreshing of my soul and\nbody, and hast set _Thy Word for a lantern to my feet_.(3) Without\nthese two I could not properly live; for the Word of God is the light\nof my soul, and Thy Sacrament the bread of life. These may also be\ncalled the two tables, placed on this side and on that, in the treasury\nof Thy holy Church. One table is that of the Sacred Altar, bearing the\nholy bread, that is the precious Body and Blood of Christ; the other is\nthe table of the Divine Law, containing holy doctrine, teaching the\ntrue faith, and leading steadfastly onwards even to that which is\nwithin the veil, where the Holy of Holies is.\n5. Thanks be unto Thee, O Lord Jesus, Light of Light everlasting, for\nthat table of holy doctrine which Thou has furnished unto us by Thy\nservants the Prophets and Apostles and other teachers. Thanks be to\nThee, O Creator and Redeemer of men, who to make known Thy love to the\nwhole world has prepared a great supper, in which Thou hast set forth\nfor good not the typical lamb, but Thine own most Holy Body and Blood;\nmaking all Thy faithful ones joyful with this holy banquet and giving\nthem to drink the cup of salvation, wherein are all the delights of\nParadise, and the holy Angels do feed with us, and with yet happier\nsweetness.\n6. Oh how great and honourable is the office of the priests, to whom it\nis given to consecrate the Sacrament of the Lord of majesty with holy\nwords, to bless it with the lips, to hold it in their hands, to receive\nit with their own mouth, and to administer it to others! Oh how clean\nought those hands to be, how pure the mouth, how holy the body, how\nunspotted the heart of the priest, to whom so often the Author of\npurity entereth in! From the mouth of the priest ought naught to\nproceed but what is holy, what is honest and profitable, because he so\noften receiveth the Sacrament of Christ.\n7. His eyes ought to be single and pure, seeing they are wont to look\nupon the Body of Christ; the hands should be pure and lifted towards\nheaven, which are wont to hold within them the Creator of heaven and\nearth. To priests is it specially said in the Law, _Be ye holy, for I\nthe Lord your God am holy._(4)\n8.

For this do I pray, this do I long for, that I may be wholly\nunited unto Thee, and may withdraw my heart from all created things,\nand by means of Holy Communion and frequent celebration may learn more\nand more to relish heavenly and eternal things. Ah, Lord God, when\nshall I be entirely united and lost in Thee, and altogether forgetful\nof myself? Thou in me, and I in Thee;(1) even so grant that we may in\nlike manner continue together in one.\n2. Verily Thou art my Beloved, the choicest among ten thousand,(2) in\nwhom my soul delighteth to dwell all the days of her life. Verily Thou\nart my Peacemaker, in Whom is perfect peace and true rest, apart from\nWhom is labour and sorrow and infinite misery. Verily Thou art a God\nthat hidest Thyself, and Thy counsel is not with the wicked, but Thy\nWord is with the humble and the simple. O how sweet, O Lord, is Thy\nspirit, who that Thou mightest manifest Thy sweetness towards Thy\nchildren, dost vouchsafe to refresh them with the bread which is full\nof sweetness, which cometh down from heaven. Verily there is no other\nnation so great, which hath its gods drawing nigh to them, as Thou, our\nGod, art present unto all Thy faithful ones,(3) unto whom for their\ndaily solace, and for lifting up their heart unto heaven, Thou givest\nThyself for their food and delight.\n3. For what other nation is there so renowned as the Christian people?\nOr what creature is so beloved under heaven as the devout soul to which\nGod entereth in, that he may feed it with His glorious flesh? O\nunspeakable grace! O wonderful condescension! O immeasurable love\nspecially bestowed upon men! But what reward shall I give unto the Lord\nfor this grace, for charity so mighty? There is nothing which I am able\nto present more acceptable than to give my heart altogether unto God,\nand to join it inwardly to Him. Then all my inward parts shall rejoice,\nwhen my soul shall be perfectly united unto God. Then shall He say unto\nme, “If thou wilt be with Me, I will be with thee.” And I will answer\nHim, “Vouchsafe, O Lord, to abide with me, I will gladly be with Thee;\nthis is my whole desire, even that my heart be united unto Thee.”\n(1) John xv. 4.

When I call to mind some devout\npersons who draw nigh to Thy Sacrament, O Lord, with the deepest\ndevotion and affection, then very often I am confounded in myself and\nblush for shame, that I approach Thine altar and table of Holy\nCommunion so carelessly and coldly, that I remain so dry and without\naffection, that I am not wholly kindled with love before Thee, my God,\nnor so vehemently drawn and affected as many devout persons have been,\nwho out of the very earnest desire of the Communion, and tender\naffection of heart, could not refrain from weeping, but as it were with\nmouth of heart and body alike panted inwardly after Thee, O God, O\nFountain of Life, having no power to appease or satiate their hunger,\nsave by receiving Thy Body with all joyfulness and spiritual eagerness.\n2. O truly ardent faith of those, becoming a very proof of Thy Sacred\nPresence! For they verily know their Lord in the breaking of bread,\nwhose heart so ardently burneth within them(1) when Jesus walketh with\nthem by the way. Ah me! far from me for the most part is such love and\ndevotion as this, such vehement love and ardour. Be merciful unto me, O\nJesus, good, sweet, and kind, and grant unto Thy poor suppliant to feel\nsometimes, in Holy Communion, though it be but a little, the cordial\naffection of Thy love, that my faith may grow stronger, my hope in Thy\ngoodness increase, and my charity, once kindled within me by the\ntasting of the heavenly manna, may never fail.\n3. But Thy mercy is able even to grant me the grace which I long for,\nand to visit me most tenderly with the spirit of fervour when the day\nof Thy good pleasure shall come. For, although I burn not with desire\nso vehement as theirs who are specially devout towards Thee, yet,\nthrough Thy grace, I have a desire after that greatly inflamed desire,\npraying and desiring to be made partaker with all those who so\nfervently love Thee, and to be numbered among their holy company.\n(1) Luke xxiv. 32."

          "content": "That the grace of devotion is acquired by humility and self-denial\nThe Voice of the Beloved\nThou oughtest to seek earnestly the grace of devotion, to ask it\nfervently, to wait for it patiently and faithfully, to receive it\ngratefully, to preserve it humbly, to work with it diligently, and to\nleave to God the time and manner of heavenly visitation until it come.\nChiefly oughtest thou to humble thyself when thou feelest inwardly\nlittle or no devotion, yet not to be too much cast down, nor to grieve\nout of measure. God ofttimes giveth in one short moment what He hath\nlong time denied; He sometimes giveth at the end what at the beginning\nof prayer He hath deferred to give.\n2. If grace were always given immediately, and were at hand at the\nwish, it would be hardly bearable to weak man. Wherefore the grace of\ndevotion is to be waited for with a good hope and with humble patience.\nYet impute it to thyself and to thy sins when it is not given, or when\nit is mysteriously taken away. It is sometimes a small thing which\nhindereth and hideth grace; (if indeed that ought to be called _small_\nand not rather _great_, which hindereth so great a good); but if thou\nremove this, be it small or great, and perfectly overcome it, thou wilt\nhave what thou hast asked.\n3. For immediately that thou hast given thyself unto God with all thine\nheart, and hast sought neither this nor that according to thine own\nwill and pleasure, but hast altogether settled thyself in Him, thou\nshalt find thyself united and at peace; because nothing shall give thee\nso sweet relish and delight, as the good pleasure of the Divine will.\nWhosoever therefore shall have lifted up his will unto God with\nsingleness of heart, and shall have delivered himself from every\ninordinate love or dislike of any created thing, he will be the most\nfit for receiving grace, and worthy of the gift of devotion. For where\nthe Lord findeth empty vessels,(1) there giveth He His blessing. And\nthe more perfectly a man forsaketh things which cannot profit, and the\nmore he dieth to himself, the more quickly doth grace come, the more\nplentifully doth it enter in, and the higher doth it lift up the free\nheart.\n4. Then shall he see, and flow together, and wonder, and his heart\nshall be enlarged within him,(2) because the hand of the Lord is with\nhim, and he hath put himself wholly in His hand, even for ever. Lo,\nthus shall the man be blessed, that seeketh God with all his heart, and\nreceiveth not his soul in vain. This man in receiving the Holy\nEucharist obtaineth the great grace of Divine Union; because he hath\nnot regard to his own devotion and comfort, but, above all devotion and\ncomfort, to the glory and honour of God.\n(1) 2 Kings iv.

          "content": "That a man should not be a curious searcher of the Sacrament, but a\nhumble imitator of Christ, submitting his sense to holy faith\nThe Voice of the Beloved\nThou must take heed of curious and useless searching into this most\nprofound Sacrament, if thou wilt not be plunged into the abyss of\ndoubt. He that is a searcher of Majesty shall be oppressed by the glory\nthereof.(1) God is able to do more than man can understand. A pious and\nhumble search after truth is to be allowed, when it is always ready to\nbe taught, and striving to walk after the wholesome opinions of the\nfathers.\n2. Blessed is the simplicity which leaveth alone the difficult paths of\nquestionings, and followeth the plain and firm steps of God’s\ncommandments. Many have lost devotion whilst they sought to search into\ndeeper things. Faith is required of thee, and a sincere life, not\nloftiness of intellect, nor deepness in the mysteries of God. If thou\nunderstandest not nor comprehendest the things which are beneath thee,\nhow shalt thou comprehend those which are above thee? Submit thyself\nunto God, and humble thy sense to faith, and the light of knowledge\nshall be given thee, as shall be profitable and necessary unto thee.\n3. There are some who are grievously tempted concerning faith and the\nSacrament; but this is not to be imputed to themselves but rather to\nthe enemy. Care not then for this, dispute not with thine own thoughts,\nnor make answer to the doubts which are cast into thee by the devil;\nbut believe the words of God, believe His Saints and Prophets, and the\nwicked enemy shall flee from thee. Often it profiteth much, that the\nservant of God endureth such things. For the enemy tempteth not\nunbelievers and sinners, because he already hath secure possession of\nthem; but he tempteth and harasseth the faithful and devout by various\nmeans.\n4. Go forward therefore with simple and undoubting faith, and draw nigh\nunto the Sacrament with supplicating reverence. And whatsoever thou art\nnot enabled to understand, that commit without anxiety to Almighty God.\nGod deceiveth thee not; he is deceived who believeth too much in\nhimself. God walketh with the simple, revealeth Himself to the humble,\ngiveth understanding to babes, openeth the sense to pure minds, and\nhideth grace from the curious and proud. Human reason is weak and may\nbe deceived; but true faith cannot be deceived.\n5. All reason and natural investigation ought to follow faith, not to\nprecede, nor to break it. For faith and love do here especially take\nthe highest place, and work in hidden ways in this most holy and\nexceeding excellent Sacrament. God who is eternal and incomprehensible,\nand of infinite power, doth great and inscrutable things in heaven and\nin earth, and His wonderful works are past finding out. If the works of\nGod were of such sort that they might easily be comprehended by human\nreason, they should no longer be called wonderful or unspeakable.\n(1) Proverbs xxv. 27 (Vulg.).\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IMITATION OF CHRIST ***\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
