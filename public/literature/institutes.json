His great natural\nabilities, his profound erudition, his well balanced and discriminating\njudgment, and his habits of diligent investigation, eminently fitted him\nto prepare such a work as the “Institutes,” in which the doctrines of the\ngospel are so clearly developed and harmonized, that the system has been\nclosely associated with his name, from the period of its publication until\nthe present time.\nThe honour of Calvin consisted, not in suggesting ingenious theories and\nspeculations, but in his general accuracy in interpreting the Holy\nScriptures, and in detecting and pointing out the connection of Scripture\ndoctrines, which, instead of being insulated, were shown to occupy their\nrespective places in forming a complete and perfect system of Divine\ntruth. The doctrines embraced in the formularies of the Presbyterian\nChurch are termed Calvinistic, from their general accordance with Calvin’s\ninterpretation of scriptural truth; but the admission of this term, as\nexplanatory of their general character, is not understood as by any means\nimplying an entire coincidence in the views of Calvin, or a submission to\nhis authority as an umpire in theological controversies. Although a\nlearned and pious, he was a fallible man; and his opinions, although\ndeserving of profound respect, are not to be blindly followed.\nWhile admitting that the “Institutes,” considering the times and\ncircumstances in which they were written, form an invaluable body of\ndivinity, still it must be acknowledged, that some of the doctrines\ntherein maintained have been more luminously set forth in modern times. We\nwould especially mention as an instance the doctrine of justification\nthrough the imputed righteousness of Christ. Some of the expressions of\nCalvin on the subject of reprobation may be regarded as too unqualified,\nand we can no further endorse them than as they are incorporated in the\nPresbyterian Confession of Faith. The most decidedly objectionable feature\nin the “Christian Institutes,” is to be found in the explanation of the\nFourth Commandment, where the author asserts the abrogation of the\nSabbath. In Calvin’s view, this ordinance was a mere type of better\nblessings, and, with the types and ceremonies of the old dispensation, was\ndone away by the introduction of a new and better dispensation. In this\nopinion there can be no doubt that he greatly erred; and so universal is\nthe conviction of the Church on the perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as\na moral institution, that no danger is to be apprehended from a contrary\nview, even under the sanction of so great a name as that of Calvin. In\njustice to his opinion on this subject, however, it should be stated, that\nhe distinctly recognized not only the propriety but the necessity of a\nconsecration of stated days for public religious services, without which\nregulation, he declares that “it is so far from being possible to preserve\norder and decorum, that if it were abolished, the Church would be in\nimminent danger of immediate convulsion and ruin.” It is much to be\nlamented that so great a mind should have been led astray on so important\na point by attempting to avoid an opposite extreme.\nThe Board of Publication have been induced to undertake this edition, by\nthe very generous offer of the First and Second Presbyterian Churches in\nBaltimore, of which the Rev. John Backus and the Rev. Dr. R. J.\nBreckinridge are respectively Pastors, to defray the expense of\nstereotyping the work. Under the direction of the Executive Committee of\nthe Board, the translation has been diligently compared throughout with\nthe original Latin and French, and various corrections have been made to\nconvey the meaning of the author more distinctly and accurately. This\nlaborious duty has been performed by a member of the Publishing Committee.\nThe intrinsic excellence of the work, taken in connection with the\nattractive style, and comparative cheapness, of the present edition,\ninduces the Committee to hope, that it may be widely circulated and\ncarefully studied, both by the clergy and laymen of the Presbyterian\nChurch.\nIn behalf of the Executive Committee,\nWilliam M. Engles, EDITOR.\nTHE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\nThe English Reader is here presented with a translation of one of the\nprincipal theological productions of the sixteenth century. Few persons,\ninto whose hands this translation is likely to fall, will require to be\ninformed that the Author of the original work was one of an illustrious\ntriumvirate, who acted a most conspicuous part in what has been generally\nand justly denominated THE REFORMATION. Of that important revolution in\necclesiastical affairs, so necessary to the interests of true religion,\nand productive of such immense advantages even to civil society, LUTHER,\nZUINGLE, and CALVIN, were honoured, by the providence of God, to be the\nmost highly distinguished instruments. It is no degradation to the memory\nof the many other ornaments of that age, to consider them as brilliant\nsatellites in the firmament of the Church, revolving round these primary\nluminaries, to whom they were indebted for much of that lustre which they\ndiffused over the earth; while they were all together revolving around one\nand the same common centre, though, it must be confessed, with\nconsiderable varieties of approximation, velocity, and obliquity in their\ncourses; yet all deriving more or less copious communications of light\nfrom the great Sun of the moral system, THE TRUE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.\nDiffering in the powers of their minds, as well as in the temperament of\ntheir bodily constitutions, placed in different circumstances, and called\nto act in different scenes, these leading Reformers, though engaged in the\nsame common cause, displayed their characteristic and peculiar\nexcellences; which, it is no disparagement of that cause to admit, were\nlikewise accompanied by peculiar failings. It is not the design of this\npreface to portray and discriminate their respective characters. They\nalike devoted their lives and labours to rescue Christianity from the\nabsurdities, superstitions, and vices by which it had been so deplorably\ndeformed, mutilated, and obscured, and to recall the attention of mankind\nfrom the doubtful traditions of men to the unerring word of God. But while\nthey were all distinguished Reformers, Calvin has been generally\nacknowledged to have been the most eminent theologian of the three.\nSuch was the superiority of the talents and attainments of Calvin to those\nof most other great men, that the strictest truth is in danger of being\ntaken for exaggeration. It is impossible for any candid and intelligent\nperson to have even a slight acquaintance with his writings, without\nadmiring his various knowledge, extensive learning, profound penetration,\nsolid judgment, acute reasoning, pure morality, and fervent piety.\nHis COMMENTARIES on the Scriptures have been celebrated for a juster\nmethod of exposition than had been exhibited by any preceding writer.\nAbove a hundred years after his death, Poole, the author of the Synopsis,\nin the preface to that valuable work, says, “Calvin’s Commentaries abound\nin solid discussions of theological subjects, and practical improvements\nof them. Subsequent writers have borrowed most of their materials from\nCalvin, and his interpretations adorn the books even of those who repay\nthe obligation by reproaching their master.” And nothing can more\nsatisfactorily evince the high estimation to which they are still entitled\nfrom the biblical student, than the following testimony, given, after the\nlapse of another century, by the late learned Bishop Horsley: “I hold the\nmemory of Calvin in high veneration: his works have a place in my library;\nand in the study of the Holy Scriptures, he is one of the commentators\nwhom I frequently consult.”\nBut perhaps, of all the writings of Calvin, none has excited so much\nattention as his INSTITUTES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.\nHis original design in commencing this work is stated by himself, in the\nbeginning of his dedication, to have been to supply his countrymen, the\nFrench, with an elementary compendium for their instruction in the\nprinciples of true religion. But we learn from Beza that, by the time of\nits completion, existing circumstances furnished the Author with an\nadditional motive for sending it into the world, during his residence at\nBasil, whither he had retired to avoid the persecution which was then\nraging in France against all the dissentients from the Church of Rome.\nFrancis the First, king of France, courted the friendship of the\nProtestant princes of Germany; and knowing their detestation of the\ncruelties which he employed against his subjects of the reformed religion,\nhe endeavoured to excuse his conduct by alleging that he caused none to be\nput to death except some few fanatics; who, so far from taking the word of\nGod as the rule of their faith, gave themselves up to the impulses of\ntheir disordered imaginations, and even openly avowed a contempt of\nmagistrates and sovereign princes. Unable to bear such foul aspersions of\nhis brethren, Calvin determined on the immediate publication of this\ntreatise, which he thought would serve as an answer to the calumnies\ncirculated by the enemies of the truth, and as an apology for his pious\nand persecuted countrymen.\nThe Dedication to Francis is one of the most masterly compositions of\nmodern times. The purity, elegance, and energy of style; the bold, yet\nrespectful, freedom of address; the firm attachment to the Divine word;\nthe Christian fortitude in the midst of persecution; the triumphant\nrefutation of the calumnies of detractors; with other qualities which\ndistinguish this celebrated remonstrance, will surely permit no reader of\ntaste or piety to withhold his concurrence from the general admiration\nwhich it has received.\nThe Author composed this treatise in Latin and French, and though, at its\nfirst appearance, it was little more than an outline of what it afterwards\nbecame, it was received with uncommon approbation, and a second edition of\nit was soon required. How many editions it passed through during his life,\nit is difficult, if not impossible, now to ascertain; but it obtained a\nvery extensive circulation, and was reprinted several times, and every\ntime was further improved and enlarged by him, till, in the year 1559,\ntwenty‐three years after the first impression, he put the finishing hand\nto his work, and published it in Latin and French, with his last\ncorrections and additions.\nThe circulation which it enjoyed was not confined to persons capable of\nreading it in the languages in which it was written. It was translated\ninto High Dutch, Low Dutch, Italian, and Spanish.\nSoon after the publication of the Author’s last edition, it was translated\nfrom the Latin into English. In this language it appears to have reached\nsix editions in the life of the Translator. A reflection on the small\nnumber of persons who may be supposed to have had inclination and ability\nto read such a book at that period, compared with the number of readers in\nthe present age, may excite some wonder that there should have been a\ndemand for so many editions. But no surprise at this circumstance will be\nfelt by any person acquainted with the high estimation in which the works\nof the Author were held by the venerable Reformers of the Church of\nEngland, and their immediate successors, as well as by the great majority\nof religious people in this country. This is not a question of opinion,\nbut an undeniable fact. Dr. Heylin, the admirer and biographer of\nArchbishop Laud, speaking of the early part of the seventeenth century,\nsays, that Calvin’s “Book of Institutes was, for the most part, the\nfoundation on which the young divines of those times did build their\nstudies.” The great Dr. Saunderson, who was chaplain to King Charles I.,\nand, after the restoration of Charles II., was created Bishop of Lincoln,\nsays, “When I began to set myself to the study of divinity as my proper\nbusiness, Calvin’s Institutions were recommended to me, as they were\ngenerally to all young scholars in those times, as the best and perfectest\nsystem of divinity, and the fittest to be laid as a ground‐work in the\nstudy of this profession. And, indeed, my expectation was not at all\ndeceived in the reading of those Institutions.”(1)\nThe great changes which have taken place in our language render it\ndifficult to form a correct opinion of the merits of Mr. Norton’s\ntranslation, which was first published about two hundred and fifty years\nago. It must give rather a favourable idea of its execution, that it was\ncarefully revised by the Rev. David Whitehead, a man of learning and\npiety, who, in the reign of Henry VIII., was nominated by Archbishop\nCranmer to a bishopric in Ireland, and, soon after the accession of Queen\nElizabeth, was solicited by that Princess to fill the metropolitan see of\nCanterbury, but declined the preferment. But, whatever were the merits or\ndefects of that translation at its first appearance, it has long been too\nantiquated, uncouth, and obscure, to convey any just idea of the original\nwork, and abounds with passages which, to the modern English reader,\ncannot but be altogether unintelligible.\nThe intrinsic excellence of the book, its importance in the history of\ntheological controversy, the celebrity of the Author, the application of\nhis name to designate the leading principles of the system he maintained,\nand the frequent collision of sentiment respecting various parts of that\nsystem, combine with other considerations to render it a matter of wonder,\nthat it has not long ago been given to the English public in a new dress.\nThe importance of it has also been much increased by the recent\ncontroversy respecting Calvinism, commenced by Dr. Tomline, the present\nBishop of Lincoln, in which such direct and copious reference has been\nmade to the writings of this Reformer, and especially to his CHRISTIAN\nINSTITUTES. These circumstances and considerations have led to the present\ntranslation and publication, which, from the very respectable\nencouragement it has received, the Translator trusts will be regarded as\nan acceptable service to the religious public.\nAmong the different methods of translation which have been recommended, he\nhas adopted that which appeared to him best fitted to the present\nundertaking. A servile adherence to the letter of the original, the style\nof which is so very remote from the English idiom, he thought would convey\na very inadequate representation of the work; such extreme fidelity, to\nuse an expression of Cowper’s, being seldom successful, even in a faithful\ntransmission of the precise sentiments of the author to the mind of the\nreader. A mere attention to the ideas and sentiments of the original, to\nthe neglect of its style and manner, would expose the Translator of a\ntreatise of this nature to no small danger of misrepresenting the meaning\nof the Author, by too frequent and unnecessary deviations from his\nlanguage. He has, therefore, aimed at a medium between servility and\nlooseness, and endeavoured to follow the style of the original as far as\nthe respective idioms of the Latin and English would admit.\nAfter the greater part of the work had been translated, he had the\nhappiness to meet with an edition in French of which he has availed\nhimself in translating the remainder, and in the revision of what he had\ntranslated before. Every person, who understands any two languages, will\nbe aware that the ambiguity of one will sometimes be explained by the\nprecision of another; and, notwithstanding the acknowledged superiority of\nthe Latin to the French in most of the qualities which constitute the\nexcellence of a language, the case of the article is not the only one in\nwhich Calvin’s French elucidates his Latin.\nThe scriptural quotations which occur in the work, the Translator has\ngiven, generally, in the words of our common English version; sometimes\naccording to the readings in the margin of that version; and, in a few\ninstances, he has literally translated the version adopted by the Author,\nwhere the context required his peculiar reading to be preserved. Almost\nall the writers of that age, writing chiefly in a dead language, were\naccustomed to speak of their adversaries in language which the polished\nmanners of the modern times have discarded, and which would now be deemed\nilliberal and scurrilous. Where these cases occur, the Translator has not\nthought himself bound to a literal rendering of every word, or at liberty\nto refine them entirely away, but has adopted such expressions as he\napprehends will give a faithful representation of the spirit of the Author\nto modern readers.\nIntending this work as a complete system of theology, the Author has made\nit the repository of his sentiments on all points of faith and practice.\nThe whole being distributed into four parts, in conformity to the\nApostles’ Creed, and this plan being very different from that of most\nother bodies of divinity, the Translator has borrowed from the Latin\nedition of Amsterdam a very perspicuous general syllabus, which will give\nthe reader a clear view of the original design and plan of the treatise.\nHe would not be understood to represent these Institutes as a perfect\nsummary of Christian doctrines and morals, or to profess an unqualified\napprobation of all the sentiments they contain. This is a homage to which\nno uninspired writings can ever be entitled. But the simplicity of the\nmethod; the freedom from the barbarous terms, captious questions, minute\ndistinctions, and intricate subtilties of many other Divines; the\nclearness and closeness of argument; the complete refutation of the\nadvocates of the Romish Church, sometimes by obvious conclusions from\ntheir professed principles, sometimes by clear proofs of the absurdities\nthey involve; the intimate knowledge of ecclesiastical history; the\nintimate acquaintance with former theological controversies; the\nperspicuity of scriptural interpretation; and the uniform spirit of\ngenuine piety, which pervade the book, cannot escape the observation of\nany judicious reader.\nIt has been advised by some persons that the translation should be\naccompanied by a few notes, to elucidate and enforce some passages, and to\ncorrect others; but, on all the consideration which the Translator has\nbeen able to give to this subject, he has thought it would be best to\ncontent himself with the humble office of placing the sentiments of Calvin\nbefore the reader, with all the fidelity in his power, without any\naddition or limitation. He hopes that the present publication will serve\nthe cause of true religion, and that the reputation of the work itself\nwill sustain no diminution from the form in which it now appears.\nLONDON, _May 12, 1813_.\nTHE AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO AN EDITION PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1559, WITH HIS\nLAST CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS.\nIn the first edition of this work, not expecting that success which the\nLord, in his infinite goodness, hath given, I handled the subject for the\nmost part in a superficial manner, as is usual in small treatises. But\nwhen I understood that it had obtained from almost all pious persons such\na favourable acceptance as I never could have presumed to wish, much less\nto hope; while I was conscious of receiving far more attention than I had\ndeserved, I thought it would evince great ingratitude, if I did not\nendeavour at least, according to my humble ability, to make some suitable\nreturn for the attentions paid to me—attentions of themselves calculated\nto stimulate my industry. Nor did I attempt this only in the second\nedition; but in every succeeding one the work has been improved by some\nfurther enlargements. But though I repented not the labour then devoted to\nit, yet I never satisfied myself, till it was arranged in the order in\nwhich it is now published; and I trust I have here presented to my readers\nwhat their judgments will unite in approving. Of my diligent application\nto the accomplishment of this service for the Church of God, I can produce\nabundant proof. For, last winter, when I thought that a quartan ague would\nspeedily terminate in my death, the more my disorder increased, the less I\nspared myself, till I had finished this book, to leave it behind me, as\nsome grateful return to such kind solicitations of the religious public.\nIndeed, I would rather it had been done sooner; but it is soon enough, if\nwell enough. I shall think it has appeared at the proper time, when I\nshall find it to have been more beneficial than before to the Church of\nGod. This is my only wish.\nI should indeed be ill requited for my labour, if I did not content myself\nwith the approbation of God alone, despising equally the foolish and\nperverse judgments of ignorant men, and the calumnies and detractions of\nthe wicked. For though God hath wholly devoted my mind to study the\nenlargement of his kingdom, and the promotion of general usefulness; and I\nhave the testimony of my own conscience, of angels, and of God himself,\nthat, since I undertook the office of a teacher in the Church, I have had\nno other object in view than to profit the Church by maintaining the pure\ndoctrine of godliness; yet I suppose there is no man more slandered or\ncalumniated than myself. When this Preface was actually in the press, I\nhad certain information, that at Augsburg, where the States of the Empire\nwere assembled, a report had been circulated of my defection to popery,\nand received with unbecoming eagerness in the courts of the princes. This\nis the gratitude of those who cannot be unacquainted with the numerous\nproofs of my constancy, which not only refute such a foul calumny, but,\nwith all equitable and humane judges, ought to preserve me from it. But\nthe devil, with all his host, is deceived, if he think to overwhelm me\nwith vile falsehoods, or to render me more timid, indolent, or dilatory,\nby such indignities. For I trust that God, in his infinite goodness, will\nenable me to persevere with patient constancy in the career of his holy\ncalling; of which I afford my pious readers a fresh proof in this edition.\nNow, my design in this work has been to prepare and qualify students of\ntheology for the reading of the divine word, that they may have an easy\nintroduction to it, and be enabled to proceed in it without any\nobstruction. For I think I have given such a comprehensive summary, and\norderly arrangement of all the branches of religion, that, with proper\nattention, no person will find any difficulty in determining what ought to\nbe the principal objects of his research in the Scripture, and to what end\nhe ought to refer any thing it contains. This way, therefore, being\nprepared, if I should hereafter publish any expositions of the Scripture,\nI shall have no need to introduce long discussions respecting doctrines,\nor digressions on common topics, and therefore shall always compress them\nwithin a narrow compass. This will relieve the pious reader from great\ntrouble and tediousness, provided he come previously furnished with the\nnecessary information, by a knowledge of the present work. But as the\nreason of this design is very evident in my numerous Commentaries, I would\nrather have it known from the fact itself, than from my declaration.\nFarewell, friendly reader; and if you receive any benefit from my labours,\nlet me have the assistance of your prayers with God our Father.\nGENEVA, _1st August, 1559_.\nDEDICATION.\n_To His Most Christian Majesty_, FRANCIS, _King of the French, and\nhis Sovereign, John Calvin wisheth peace and salvation in Christ_.\nWhen I began this work, Sire, nothing was further from my thoughts than\nwriting a book which would afterwards be presented to your Majesty. My\nintention was only to lay down some elementary principles, by which\ninquirers on the subject of religion might be instructed in the nature of\ntrue piety. And this labour I undertook chiefly for my countrymen, the\nFrench, of whom I apprehended multitudes to be hungering and thirsting\nafter Christ, but saw very few possessing any real knowledge of him. That\nthis was my design, the book itself proves by its simple method and\nunadorned composition. But when I perceived that the fury of certain\nwicked men in your kingdom had grown to such a height, as to leave no room\nin the land for sound doctrine, I thought I should be usefully employed,\nif in the same work I delivered my instructions to them, and exhibited my\nconfession to you, that you may know the nature of that doctrine, which is\nthe object of such unbounded rage to those madmen who are now disturbing\nthe country with fire and sword. For I shall not be afraid to acknowledge,\nthat this treatise contains a summary of that very doctrine, which,\naccording to their clamours, deserves to be punished with imprisonment,\nbanishment, proscription, and flames, and to be exterminated from the face\nof the earth. I well know with what atrocious insinuations your ears have\nbeen filled by them, in order to render our cause most odious in your\nesteem; but your clemency should lead you to consider that, if accusation\nbe accounted a sufficient evidence of guilt, there will be an end of all\ninnocence in words and actions. If any one, indeed, with a view to bring\nan odium upon the doctrine which I am endeavouring to defend, should\nallege that it has long ago been condemned by the general consent, and\nsuppressed by many judicial decisions, this will be only equivalent to\nsaying, that it has been sometimes violently rejected through the\ninfluence and power of its adversaries, and sometimes insidiously and\nfraudulently oppressed by falsehoods, artifices, and calumnies. Violence\nis displayed, when sanguinary sentences are passed against it without the\ncause being heard; and fraud, when it is unjustly accused of sedition and\nmischief. Lest any one should suppose that these our complaints are\nunfounded, you yourself, Sire, can bear witness of the false calumnies\nwith which you hear it daily traduced; that its only tendency is to wrest\nthe sceptres of kings out of their hands, to overturn all the tribunals\nand judicial proceedings, to subvert all order and governments, to disturb\nthe peace and tranquillity of the people, to abrogate all laws, to scatter\nall properties and possessions, and, in a word, to involve every thing in\ntotal confusion. And yet you hear the smallest portion of what is alleged\nagainst it; for such horrible things are circulated amongst the vulgar,\nthat, if they were true, the whole world would justly pronounce it and its\nabettors worthy of a thousand fires and gibbets. Who, then, will wonder at\nits becoming the object of public odium, where credit is given to such\nmost iniquitous accusations? This is the cause of the general consent and\nconspiracy to condemn us and our doctrine. Hurried away with this impulse,\nthose who sit in judgment pronounce for sentences the prejudices they\nbrought from home with them; and think their duty fully discharged if they\ncondemn none to be punished but such as are convicted by their own\nconfession, or by sufficient proofs. Convicted of what crime? Of this\ncondemned doctrine, they say. But with what justice is it condemned? Now,\nthe ground of defence was not to abjure the doctrine itself, but to\nmaintain its truth. On this subject, however, not a word is allowed to be\nuttered.\nWherefore I beseech you, Sire,—and surely it is not an unreasonable\nrequest,—to take upon yourself the entire cognizance of this cause, which\nhas hitherto been confusedly and carelessly agitated, without any order of\nlaw, and with outrageous passion rather than judicial gravity. Think not\nthat I am now meditating my own individual defence, in order to effect a\nsafe return to my native country; for, though I feel the affection which\nevery man ought to feel for it, yet, under the existing circumstances, I\nregret not my removal from it. But I plead the cause of all the godly, and\nconsequently of Christ himself, which, having been in these times\npersecuted and trampled on in all ways in your kingdom, now lies in a most\ndeplorable state; and this indeed rather through the tyranny of certain\nPharisees, than with your knowledge. How this comes to pass is foreign to\nmy present purpose to say; but it certainly lies in a most afflicted\nstate. For the ungodly have gone to such lengths, that the truth of\nChrist, if not vanquished, dissipated, and entirely destroyed, is buried,\nas it were, in ignoble obscurity, while the poor, despised church is\neither destroyed by cruel massacres, or driven away into banishment, or\nmenaced and terrified into total silence. And still they continue their\nwonted madness and ferocity, pushing violently against the wall already\nbent, and finishing the ruin they have begun. In the mean time, no one\ncomes forward to plead the cause against such furies. If there be any\npersons desirous of appearing most favourable to the truth, they only\nventure an opinion, that forgiveness should be extended to the error and\nimprudence of ignorant people. For this is the language of these moderate\nmen, calling _that_ error and imprudence which they know to be the certain\ntruth of God, and _those_ ignorant people, whose understanding they\nperceive not to have been so despicable to Christ, but that he has\nfavoured them with the mysteries of his heavenly wisdom. Thus all are\nashamed of the Gospel. But it shall be yours, Sire, not to turn away your\nears or thoughts from so just a defence, especially in a cause of such\nimportance as the maintenance of God’s glory unimpaired in the world, the\npreservation of the honour of divine truth, and the continuance of the\nkingdom of Christ uninjured among us. This is a cause worthy of your\nattention, worthy of your cognizance, worthy of your throne. This\nconsideration constitutes true royalty, to acknowledge yourself in the\ngovernment of your kingdom to be the minister of God. For where the glory\nof God is not made the end of the government, it is not a legitimate\nsovereignty, but a usurpation. And he is deceived who expects lasting\nprosperity in that kingdom which is not ruled by the sceptre of God, that\nis, his holy word; for that heavenly oracle cannot fail, which declares\nthat “where there is no vision, the people perish.”(2) Nor should you be\nseduced from this pursuit by a contempt of our meanness. We are fully\nconscious to ourselves how very mean and abject we are, being miserable\nsinners before God, and accounted most despicable by men; being (if you\nplease) the refuse of the world, deserving of the vilest appellations that\ncan be found; so that nothing remains for us to glory in before God, but\nhis mercy alone, by which, without any merit of ours, we have been\nadmitted to the hope of eternal salvation, and before men nothing but our\nweakness, the slightest confession of which is esteemed by them as the\ngreatest disgrace. But our doctrine must stand, exalted above all the\nglory, and invincible by all the power of the world; because it is not\nours, but the doctrine of the living God, and of his Christ, whom the\nFather hath constituted King, that he may have dominion from sea to sea,\nand from the river even to the ends of the earth, and that he may rule in\nsuch a manner, that the whole earth, with its strength of iron and with\nits splendour of gold and silver, smitten by the rod of his mouth, may be\nbroken to pieces like a potter’s vessel;(3) for thus do the prophets\nforetell the magnificence of his kingdom.\nOur adversaries reply, that our pleading the word of God is a false\npretence, and that we are nefarious corrupters of it. But that this is not\nonly a malicious calumny, but egregious impudence, by reading our\nconfession, you will, in your wisdom, be able to judge. Yet something\nfurther is necessary to be said, to excite your attention, or at least to\nprepare your mind for this perusal. Paul’s direction, that every prophecy\nbe framed “according to the analogy of faith,”(4) has fixed an invariable\nstandard by which all interpretation of Scripture ought to be tried. If\nour principles be examined by this rule of faith, the victory is ours. For\nwhat is more consistent with faith than to acknowledge ourselves naked of\nall virtue, that we may be clothed by God; empty of all good, that we may\nbe filled by him; slaves to sin, that we may be liberated by him; blind,\nthat we may be enlightened by him; lame, that we may be guided; weak, that\nwe may be supported by him; to divest ourselves of all ground of glorying,\nthat he alone may be eminently glorious, and that we may glory in him?\nWhen we advance these and similar sentiments, they interrupt us with\ncomplaints that this is the way to overturn, I know not what blind light\nof nature, pretended preparations, free will, and works meritorious of\neternal salvation, together with all their supererogations; because they\ncannot bear that the praise and glory of all goodness, strength,\nrighteousness, and wisdom, should remain entirely with God. But we read of\nnone being reproved for having drawn too freely from the fountain of\nliving waters; on the contrary, they are severely upbraided who have\n“hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.”(5)\nAgain, what is more consistent with faith, than to assure ourselves of God\nbeing a propitious Father, where Christ is acknowledged as a brother and\nMediator? than securely to expect all prosperity and happiness from Him,\nwhose unspeakable love towards us went so far, that “he spared not his own\nSon, but delivered him up for us?”(6) than to rest in the certain\nexpectation of salvation and eternal life, when we reflect upon the\nFather’s gift of Christ, in whom such treasures are hidden? Here they\noppose us, and complain that this certainty of confidence is chargeable\nwith arrogance and presumption. But as we ought to presume nothing of\nourselves, so we should presume every thing of God; nor are we divested of\nvain glory for any other reason than that we may learn to glory in the\nLord. What shall I say more? Review, Sire, all the parts of our cause, and\nconsider us worse than the most abandoned of mankind, unless you clearly\ndiscover that we thus “both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust\nin the living God,”(7) because we believe that “this is life eternal, to\nknow the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent.”(8) For this\nhope some of us are bound in chains, others are lashed with scourges,\nothers are carried about as laughing‐stocks, others are outlawed, others\nare cruelly tortured, others escape by flight; but we are all reduced to\nextreme perplexities, execrated with dreadful curses, cruelly slandered,\nand treated with the greatest indignities. Now, look at our adversaries,\n(I speak of the order of priests, at whose will and directions others\ncarry on these hostilities against us,) and consider a little with me by\nwhat principles they are actuated. The true religion, which is taught in\nthe Scriptures, and ought to be universally maintained, they readily\npermit both themselves and others to be ignorant of, and to treat with\nneglect and contempt. They think it unimportant what any one holds or\ndenies concerning God and Christ, provided he submits his mind with an\nimplicit faith (as they call it) to the judgment of the Church. Nor are\nthey much affected, if the glory of God happens to be violated with open\nblasphemies, provided no one lift a finger against the primacy of the\nApostolic See, and the authority of their holy Mother Church. Why,\ntherefore, do they contend with such extreme bitterness and cruelty for\nthe mass, purgatory, pilgrimages, and similar trifles, and deny that any\npiety can be maintained without a most explicit faith, so to speak, in\nthese things; whereas they prove none of them from the Word of God? Why,\nbut because their belly is their god, their kitchen is their religion;\ndeprived of which they consider themselves no longer as Christians, or\neven as men. For though some feast themselves in splendour, and others\nsubsist on slender fare, yet all live on the same pot, which, without this\nfuel, would not only cool, but completely freeze. Every one of them,\ntherefore, who is most solicitous for his belly, is found to be a most\nstrenuous champion for their faith. Indeed, they universally exert\nthemselves for the preservation of their kingdom, and the repletion of\ntheir bellies; but not one of them discovers the least indication of\nsincere zeal.\nNor do their attacks on our doctrine cease here; they urge every topic of\naccusation and abuse to render it an object of hatred or suspicion. They\ncall it novel, and of recent origin,—they cavil at it as doubtful and\nuncertain,—they inquire by what miracles it is confirmed,—they ask whether\nit is right for it to be received contrary to the consent of so many holy\nfathers, and the custom of the highest antiquity,—they urge us to confess\nthat it is schismatical in stirring up opposition against the Church, or\nthat the Church was wholly extinct for many ages, during which no such\nthing was known.—Lastly, they say all arguments are unnecessary; for that\nits nature may be determined by its fruits, since it has produced such a\nmultitude of sects, so many factious tumults, and such great\nlicentiousness of vices. It is indeed very easy for them to insult a\ndeserted cause with the credulous and ignorant multitude; but, if we had\nalso the liberty of speaking in our turn, this acrimony, which they now\ndiscover in violently foaming against us with equal licentiousness and\nimpunity, would presently cool.\nIn the first place, their calling it novel is highly injurious to God,\nwhose holy word deserves not to be accused of novelty. I have no doubt of\nits being new to them, to whom Jesus Christ and the Gospel are equally\nnew. But those who know the antiquity of this preaching of Paul, “that\nJesus Christ died for our sins, and rose again for our justification,”(9)\nwill find no novelty among us. That it has long been concealed, buried,\nand unknown, is the crime of human impiety. Now that the goodness of God\nhas restored it to us, it ought at least to be allowed its just claim of\nantiquity.\nFrom the same source of ignorance springs the notion of its being doubtful\nand uncertain. This is the very thing which the Lord complains of by his\nprophet; that “the ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s\ncrib,”(10) but that his people know not him. But however they may laugh at\nits uncertainty, if they were called to seal their own doctrine with their\nblood and lives, it would appear how much they value it. Very different is\nour confidence, which dreads neither the terrors of death, nor even the\ntribunal of God.\nTheir requiring miracles of us is altogether unreasonable; for we forge no\nnew Gospel, but retain the very same whose truth was confirmed by all the\nmiracles ever wrought by Christ and the apostles. But they have this\npeculiar advantage above us, that they can confirm their faith by\ncontinual miracles even to this day. But the truth is, they allege\nmiracles which are calculated to unsettle a mind otherwise well\nestablished, they are so frivolous and ridiculous, or vain and false. Nor,\nif they were ever so preternatural, ought they to have any weight in\nopposition to the truth of God, since the name of God ought to be\nsanctified in all places and at all times, whether by miraculous events,\nor by the common order of nature. This fallacy might perhaps be more\nspecious, if the Scripture did not apprize us of the legitimate end and\nuse of miracles. For Mark informs us, that the miracles which followed the\npreaching of the apostles were wrought in confirmation(11) of it, and Luke\ntells us, that(12) “the Lord gave testimony to the word of his grace,”\nwhen “signs and wonders” were “done by the hands” of the apostles. Very\nsimilar to which is the assertion of the apostle, that “salvation was\nconfirmed” by the preaching of the Gospel, “God also bearing witness with\nsigns, and wonders, and divers miracles.”(13) But those things which we\nare told were seals of the Gospel, shall we pervert to undermine the faith\nof the Gospel? Those things which were designed to be testimonials of the\ntruth, shall we accommodate to the confirmation of falsehood? It is right,\ntherefore, that the doctrine, which, according to the evangelist, claims\nthe first attention, be examined and tried in the first place; and if it\nbe approved, then it ought to derive confirmation from miracles. But it is\nthe characteristic of sound doctrine, given by Christ, that it tends to\npromote, not the glory of men, but the glory of God.(14) Christ having\nlaid down this proof of a doctrine, it is wrong to esteem those as\nmiracles which are directed to any other end than the glorification of the\nname of God alone. And we should remember that Satan has his wonders,\nwhich, though they are juggling tricks rather than real miracles, are such\nas to delude the ignorant and inexperienced. Magicians and enchanters have\nalways been famous for miracles; idolatry has been supported by\nastonishing miracles; and yet we admit them not as proofs of the\nsuperstition of magicians or idolaters. With this engine also the\nsimplicity of the vulgar was anciently assailed by the Donatists, who\nabounded in miracles. We therefore give the same answer now to our\nadversaries as Augustine(15) gave to the Donatists, that our Lord hath\ncautioned us against these miracle‐mongers by his prediction, that there\nshould arise false prophets, who, by various signs and lying wonders,\n“should deceive (if possible) the very elect.”(16) And Paul has told us,\nthat the kingdom of Antichrist would be “with all power, and signs, and\nlying wonders.”(17) But these miracles (they say) are wrought, not by\nidols, or sorcerers, or false prophets, but by saints; as if we were\nignorant, that it is a stratagem of Satan to “transform” himself “into an\nangel of light.”(18) At the tomb of Jeremiah,(19) who was buried in Egypt,\nthe Egyptians formerly offered sacrifices and other divine honours. Was\nnot this abusing God’s holy prophet to the purposes of idolatry? Yet they\nsupposed this veneration of his sepulchre to be rewarded with a cure for\nthe bite of serpents. What shall we say, but that it has been, and ever\nwill be, the most righteous vengeance of God to “send those who receive\nnot the love of the truth strong delusions, that they should believe a\nlie”?(20) We are by no means without miracles, and such as are certain,\nand not liable to cavils. But those under which they shelter themselves\nare mere illusions of Satan, seducing the people from the true worship of\nGod to vanity.\nAnother calumny is their charging us with opposition to the fathers,—I\nmean the writers of the earlier and purer ages,—as if those writers were\nabettors of their impiety; whereas, if the contest were to be terminated\nby this authority, the victory in most parts of the controversy—to speak\nin the most modest terms—would be on our side. But though the writings of\nthose fathers contain many wise and excellent things, yet in some respects\nthey have suffered the common fate of mankind; these very dutiful children\nreverence only their errors and mistakes, but their excellences they\neither overlook, or conceal, or corrupt; so that it may be truly said to\nbe their only study to collect dross from the midst of gold. Then they\noverwhelm us with senseless clamours, as despisers and enemies of the\nfathers. But we do not hold them in such contempt, but that, if it were\nconsistent with my present design, I could easily support by their\nsuffrages most of the sentiments that we now maintain. But while we make\nuse of their writings, we always remember that “all things are ours,” to\nserve us, not to have dominion over us, and that “we are Christ’s”(21)\nalone, and owe him universal obedience. He who neglects this distinction\nwill have nothing decided in religion; since those holy men were ignorant\nof many things, frequently at variance with each other, and sometimes even\ninconsistent with themselves. There is great reason, they say, for the\nadmonition of Solomon, “not to transgress or remove the ancient landmarks,\nwhich our fathers have set.”(22) But the same rule is not applicable to\nthe bounding of fields, and to the obedience of faith, which ought to be\nready to “forget her own people and her father’s house.”(23) But if they\nare so fond of allegorizing, why do they not explain the apostles, rather\nthan any others, to be those fathers, whose appointed landmarks it is so\nunlawful to remove? For this is the interpretation of Jerome, whose works\nthey have received into their canons. But if they insist on preserving the\nlandmarks of those whom they understand to be intended, why do they at\npleasure so freely transgress them themselves? There were two fathers,(24)\nof whom one said, that our God neither eats nor drinks, and therefore\nneeds neither cups nor dishes; the other, that sacred things require no\ngold, and that gold is no recommendation of that which is not purchased\nwith gold. This landmark therefore is transgressed by those who in sacred\nthings are so much delighted with gold, silver, ivory, marble, jewels, and\nsilks, and suppose that God is not rightly worshipped, unless all things\nabound in exquisite splendour, or rather extravagant profusion. There was\na father(25) who said he freely partook of flesh on a day when others\nabstained from it, because he was a Christian. They transgress the\nlandmarks therefore when they curse the soul that tastes flesh in Lent.\nThere were two fathers,(26) of whom one said, that a monk who labours not\nwith his hands is on a level with a cheat or a robber; and the other, that\nit is unlawful for monks to live on what is not their own, notwithstanding\ntheir assiduity in contemplations, studies, and prayers; and they have\ntransgressed this landmark by placing the idle and distended carcasses of\nmonks in cells and brothels, to be pampered on the substance of others.\nThere was a father(27) who said, that to see a painted image of Christ, or\nof any saint, in the temples of Christians, is a dreadful abomination. Nor\nwas this merely the sentence of an individual; it was also decreed by an\necclesiastical council, that the object of worship should not be painted\non the walls. They are far from confining themselves within these\nlandmarks, for every corner is filled with images. Another father(28) has\nadvised that, after having discharged the office of humanity towards the\ndead by the rites of sepulture, we should leave them to their repose. They\nbreak through these landmarks by inculcating a constant solicitude for the\ndead. There was one of the fathers(29) who asserted that the substance of\nbread and wine in the eucharist ceases not, but remains, just as the\nsubstance of the human nature remains in the Lord Christ united with the\ndivine. They transgress this landmark therefore by pretending that, on the\nwords of the Lord being recited, the substance of bread and wine ceases,\nand is transubstantiated into his body and blood. There were fathers(30)\nwho, while they exhibited to the universal Church only one eucharist, and\nforbade all scandalous and immoral persons to approach it, at the same\ntime severely censured all who, when present, did not partake of it. How\nfar have they removed these landmarks, when they fill not only the\nchurches, but even private houses, with their masses, admit all who choose\nto be spectators of them, and every one the more readily in proportion to\nthe magnitude of his contribution, however chargeable with impurity and\nwickedness! They invite none to faith in Christ and a faithful\nparticipation of the sacraments; but rather for purposes of gain bring\nforward their own work instead of the grace and merit of Christ. There\nwere two fathers,(31) of whom one contended that the use of Christ’s\nsacred supper should be wholly forbidden to those who, content with\npartaking of one kind, abstained from the other; the other strenuously\nmaintained that Christian people ought not to be refused the blood of\ntheir Lord, for the confession of whom they are required to shed their\nown. These landmarks also they have removed, in appointing, by an\ninviolable law, that very thing which the former punished with\nexcommunication, and the latter gave a powerful reason for disapproving.\nThere was a father(32) who asserted the temerity of deciding on either\nside of an obscure subject, without clear and evident testimonies of\nScripture. This landmark they forgot when they made so many constitutions,\ncanons, and judicial determinations, without any authority from the word\nof God. There was a father(33) who upbraided Montanus with having, among\nother heresies, been the first imposer of laws for the observance of\nfasts. They have gone far beyond this landmark also, in establishing fasts\nby the strictest laws. There was a father(34) who denied that marriage\nought to be forbidden to the ministers of the Church, and pronounced\ncohabitation with a wife to be real chastity; and there were fathers who\nassented to his judgment. They have transgressed these landmarks by\nenjoining on their priests the strictest celibacy. There was a father who\nthought that attention should be paid to Christ only, of whom it is said,\n“Hear ye him,” and that no regard should be had to what others before us\nhave either said or done, only to what has been commanded by Christ, who\nis preëminent over all. This landmark they neither prescribe to\nthemselves, nor permit to be observed by others, when they set up over\nthemselves and others any masters rather than Christ. There was a\nfather(35) who contended that the Church ought not to take the precedence\nof Christ, because his judgment is always according to truth; but\necclesiastical judges, like other men, may generally be deceived. Breaking\ndown this landmark also, they scruple not to assert, that all the\nauthority of the Scripture depends on the decision of the Church. All the\nfathers, with one heart and voice, have declared it execrable and\ndetestable for the holy word of God to be contaminated with the subtleties\nof sophists, and perplexed by the wrangles of logicians. Do they confine\nthemselves within these landmarks, when the whole business of their lives\nis to involve the simplicity of the Scripture in endless controversies,\nand worse than sophistical wrangles? so that if the fathers were now\nrestored to life, and heard this art of wrangling, which they call\nspeculative divinity, they would not suspect the dispute to have the least\nreference to God. But if I would enumerate all the instances in which the\nauthority of the fathers is insolently rejected by those who would be\nthought their dutiful children, my address would exceed all reasonable\nbounds. Months and years would be insufficient for me. And yet such is\ntheir consummate and incorrigible impudence, they dare to censure us for\npresuming to transgress the ancient landmarks.\nNor can they gain any advantage against us by their argument from custom;\nfor, if we were compelled to submit to custom, we should have to complain\nof the greatest injustice. Indeed, if the judgments of men were correct,\ncustom should be sought among the good. But the fact is often very\ndifferent. What appears to be practised by many soon obtains the force of\na custom. And human affairs have scarcely ever been in so good a state as\nfor the majority to be pleased with things of real excellence. From the\nprivate vices of multitudes, therefore, has arisen public error, or rather\na common agreement of vices, which these good men would now have to be\nreceived as law. It is evident to all who can see, that the world is\ninundated with more than an ocean of evils, that it is overrun with\nnumerous destructive pests, that every thing is fast verging to ruin, so\nthat we must altogether despair of human affairs, or vigorously and even\nviolently oppose such immense evils. And the remedy is rejected for no\nother reason, but because we have been accustomed to the evils so long.\nBut let public error be tolerated in human society; in the kingdom of God\nnothing but his eternal truth should be heard and regarded, which no\nsuccession of years, no custom, no confederacy, can circumscribe. Thus\nIsaiah once taught the chosen people of God: “Say ye not, A confederacy,\nto all to whom this people shall say, A confederacy;” that is, that they\nshould not unite in the wicked consent of the people; “nor fear their\nfear, nor be afraid,” but rather “sanctify the Lord of hosts,” that he\nmight “be their fear and their dread.”(36)Now, therefore, let them, if\nthey please, object against us past ages and present examples; if we\n“sanctify the Lord of hosts,” we shall not be much afraid. For, whether\nmany ages agree in similar impiety, he is mighty to take vengeance on the\nthird and fourth generation; or whether the whole world combine in the\nsame iniquity, he has given an example of the fatal end of those who sin\nwith a multitude, by destroying all men with a deluge, and preserving Noah\nand his small family, in order that his individual faith might condemn the\nwhole world. Lastly, a corrupt custom is nothing but an epidemical\npestilence, which is equally fatal to its objects, though they fall with a\nmultitude. Besides, they ought to consider a remark, somewhere made by\nCyprian,(37) that persons who sin through ignorance, though they cannot be\nwholly exculpated, may yet be considered in some degree excusable; but\nthose who obstinately reject the truth offered by the Divine goodness, are\nwithout any excuse at all.\nNor are we so embarrassed by their dilemma as to be obliged to confess,\neither that the Church was for some time extinct, or that we have now a\ncontroversy with the Church. The Church of Christ has lived, and will\ncontinue to live, as long as Christ shall reign at the right hand of the\nFather, by whose hand she is sustained, by whose protection she is\ndefended, by whose power she is preserved in safety. For he will\nundoubtedly perform what he once promised, to be with his people “even to\nthe end of the world.”(38) We have no quarrel against the Church, for with\none consent we unite with all the company of the faithful in worshipping\nand adoring the one God and Christ the Lord, as he has been adored by all\nthe pious in all ages. But our opponents deviate widely from the truth\nwhen they acknowledge no Church but what is visible to the corporeal eye,\nand endeavour to circumscribe it by those limits within which it is far\nfrom being included. Our controversy turns on the two following\npoints:—first, they contend that the form of the Church is always apparent\nand visible; secondly, they place that form in the see of the Roman Church\nand her order of prelates. We assert, on the contrary, first, that the\nChurch may exist without any visible form; secondly, that its form is not\ncontained in that external splendour which they foolishly admire, but is\ndistinguished by a very different criterion, viz. the pure preaching of\nGod’s word, and the legitimate administration of the sacraments. They are\nnot satisfied unless the Church can always be pointed out with the finger.\nBut how often among the Jewish people was it so disorganized, as to have\nno visible form left? What splendid form do we suppose could be seen, when\nElias deplored his being left alone?(39) How long, after the coming of\nChrist, did it remain without any external form? How often, since that\ntime, have wars, seditions, and heresies, oppressed and totally obscured\nit? If they had lived at that period, would they have believed that any\nChurch existed? Yet Elias was informed that there were “left seven\nthousand” who had “not bowed the knee to Baal.” Nor should we entertain\nany doubt of Christ’s having always reigned on earth ever since his\nascension to heaven. But if the pious at such periods had sought for any\nform evident to their senses, must not their hearts have been quite\ndiscouraged? Indeed it was already considered by Hilary in his day as a\ngrievous error, that people were absorbed in foolish admiration of the\nepiscopal dignity, and did not perceive the dreadful mischiefs concealed\nunder that disguise. For this is his language:(40) “One thing I advise\nyou—beware of Antichrist, for you have an improper attachment to walls;\nyour veneration for the Church of God is misplaced on houses and\nbuildings; you wrongly introduce under them the name of peace. Is there\nany doubt that they will be seats of Antichrist? I think mountains, woods,\nand lakes, prisons and whirlpools, less dangerous; for these were the\nscenes of retirement or banishment in which the prophets prophesied.” But\nwhat excites the veneration of the multitude in the present day for their\nhorned bishops, but the supposition that those are the holy prelates of\nreligion whom they see presiding over great cities? Away, then, with such\nstupid admiration. Let us rather leave it to the Lord, since he alone\n“knoweth them that are his,”(41) sometimes to remove from human\nobservation all external knowledge of his Church. I admit this to be a\ndreadful judgment of God on the earth; but if it be deserved by the\nimpiety of men, why do we attempt to resist the righteous vengeance of\nGod? Thus the Lord punished the ingratitude of men in former ages; for, in\nconsequence of their resistance to his truth, and extinction of the light\nhe had given them, he permitted them to be blinded by sense, deluded by\nabsurd falsehoods, and immerged in profound darkness, so that there was no\nappearance of the true Church left; yet, at the same time, in the midst of\ndarkness and errors, he preserved his scattered and concealed people from\ntotal destruction. Nor is this to be wondered at; for he knew how to save\nin all the confusion of Babylon, and the flame of the fiery furnace. But\nhow dangerous it is to estimate the form of the Church by I know not what\nvain pomp, which they contend for; I shall rather briefly suggest than\nstate at large, lest I should protract this discourse to an excessive\nlength. The Pope, they say, who holds the Apostolic see, and the bishops\nanointed and consecrated by him, provided they are equipped with mitres\nand crosiers, represent the Church, and ought to be considered as the\nChurch. Therefore they cannot err. How is this?—Because they are pastors\nof the Church, and consecrated to the Lord. And did not the pastoral\ncharacter belong to Aaron, and the other rulers of Israel? Yet Aaron and\nhis sons, after their designation to the priesthood, fell into error when\nthey made the golden calf.(42) According to this mode of reasoning, why\nshould not the four hundred prophets, who lied to Ahab, have represented\nthe Church?(43) But the Church remained on the side of Micaiah, solitary\nand despised as he was, and out of his mouth proceeded the truth. Did not\nthose prophets exhibit both the name and appearance of the Church, who\nwith united violence rose up against Jeremiah, and threatened and boasted,\n“the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor\nthe word from the prophet”?(44) Jeremiah is sent singly against the whole\nmultitude of prophets, with a denunciation from the Lord, that the “law\nshall perish from the priest, counsel from the wise, and the word from the\nprophet.”(45) And was there not the like external respectability in the\ncouncil convened by the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, to consult\nabout putting Christ to death?(46) Now, let them go and adhere to the\nexternal appearance, and thereby make Christ and all the prophets\nschismatics, and, on the other hand, make the ministers of Satan\ninstruments of the Holy Spirit. But if they speak their real sentiments,\nlet them answer me sincerely, what nation or place they consider as the\nseat of the Church, from the time when, by a decree of the council of\nBasil, Eugenius was deposed and degraded from the pontificate, and Amadeus\nsubstituted in his place. They cannot deny that the council, as far as\nrelates to external forms, was a lawful one, and summoned not only by one\npope, but by two. There Eugenius was pronounced guilty of schism,\nrebellion, and obstinacy, together with all the host of cardinals and\nbishops who had joined him in attempting a dissolution of the council. Yet\nafterwards, assisted by the favour of princes, he regained the quiet\npossession of his former dignity. That election of Amadeus, though\nformally made by the authority of a general and holy synod, vanished into\nsmoke; and he was appeased with a cardinal’s hat, like a barking dog with\na morsel. From the bosom of those heretics and rebels have proceeded all\nthe popes, cardinals, bishops, abbots, and priests, ever since. Here they\nmust stop. For to which party will they give the title of the Church? Will\nthey deny that this was a general council, which wanted nothing to\ncomplete its external majesty, being solemnly convened by two papal bulls,\nconsecrated by a presiding legate of the Roman see, and well regulated in\nevery point of order, and invariably preserving the same dignity to the\nlast? Will they acknowledge Eugenius to be a schismatic, with all his\nadherents, by whom they have all been consecrated? Either, therefore, let\nthem give a different definition of the form of the Church, or, whatever\nbe their number, we shall account them all schismatics, as having been\nknowingly and voluntarily ordained by heretics. But if it had never been\nascertained before, that the Church is not confined to external pomps,\nthey would themselves afford us abundant proof of it, who have so long\nsuperciliously exhibited themselves to the world under the title of the\nChurch, though they were at the same time the deadly plagues of it. I\nspeak not of their morals, and those tragical exploits with which all\ntheir lives abound, since they profess themselves to be Pharisees, who are\nto be heard and not imitated. I refer to the very doctrine itself, on\nwhich they found their claim to be considered as the Church. If you devote\na portion of your leisure, Sire, to the perusal of our writings, you will\nclearly discover that doctrine to be a fatal pestilence of souls, the\nfirebrand, ruin, and destruction of the Church.\nFinally, they betray great want of candour, by invidiously repeating what\ngreat commotions, tumults, and contentions, have attended the preaching of\nour doctrine, and what effects it produces in many persons. For it is\nunfair to charge it with those evils which ought to be attributed to the\nmalice of Satan. It is the native property of the Divine word, never to\nmake its appearance without disturbing Satan, and rousing his opposition.\nThis is the most certain and unequivocal criterion by which it is\ndistinguished from false doctrines, which are easily broached when they\nare heard with general attention, and received with applauses by the\nworld. Thus, in some ages, when all things were immerged in profound\ndarkness, the prince of this world amused and diverted himself with the\ngenerality of mankind, and, like another Sardanapalus, gave himself up to\nhis ease and pleasures in perfect peace; for what would he do but amuse\nand divert himself, in the quiet and undisturbed possession of his\nkingdom? But when the light shining from above dissipated a portion of his\ndarkness—when that Mighty One alarmed and assaulted his kingdom—then he\nbegan to shake off his wonted torpor, and to hurry on his armour. First,\nindeed, he stirred up the power of men to suppress the truth by violence\nat its first appearance; and when this proved ineffectual, he had recourse\nto subtlety. He made the Catabaptists, and other infamous characters, the\ninstruments of exciting dissensions and doctrinal controversies, with a\nview to obscure and finally to extinguish it. And now he continues to\nattack it in both ways; for he endeavours to root up this genuine seed by\nmeans of human force, and at the same time tries every effort to choke it\nwith his tares, that it may not grow and produce fruit. But all his\nattempts will be vain, if we attend to the admonitions of the Lord, who\nhath long ago made us acquainted with his devices, that we might not be\ncaught by him unawares, and has armed us with sufficient means of defence\nagainst all his assaults. But to charge the word of God with the odium of\nseditions, excited against it by wicked and rebellious men, or of sects\nraised by impostors,—is not this extreme malignity? Yet it is not without\nexample in former times. Elias was asked whether it was not he “that\ntroubled Israel.”(47) Christ was represented by the Jews as guilty of\nsedition.(48) The apostles were accused of stirring up popular\ncommotions.(49) Wherein does this differ from the conduct of those who, at\nthe present day, impute to us all the disturbances, tumults, and\ncontentions, that break out against us? But the proper answer to such\naccusations has been taught us by Elias, that the dissemination of errors\nand the raising of tumults is not chargeable on us, but on those who are\nresisting the power of God. But as this one reply is sufficient to repress\ntheir temerity, so, on the other hand, we must meet the weakness of some\npersons, who are frequently disturbed with such offences, and become\nunsettled and wavering in their minds. Now, that they may not stumble and\nfall amidst this agitation and perplexity, let them know that the apostles\nin their day experienced the same things that now befall us. There were\n“unlearned and unstable” men, Peter says, who “wrested” the inspired\nwritings of Paul “to their own destruction.”(50) There were despisers of\nGod, who, when they heard that “where sin abounded grace did much more\nabound,” immediately concluded, Let us “continue in sin, that grace may\nabound.” When they heard that the faithful were “not under the law,” they\nimmediately croaked, “We will sin, because we are not under the law, but\nunder grace.”(51) There were some who accused him as an encourager of sin.\nMany false apostles crept in, to destroy the churches he had raised. “Some\npreached” the gospel “of envy and strife, not in sincerity,” maliciously\n“supposing to add affliction to his bonds.”(52) In some places the Gospel\nwas attended with little benefit. “All were seeking their own, not the\nthings of Jesus Christ.”(53) Others returned “like dogs to their vomit,\nand like swine to their wallowing in the mire.”(54) Many perverted the\nliberty of the spirit into the licentiousness of the flesh. Many\ninsinuated themselves as brethren, who afterwards brought the pious into\ndangers. Various contentions were excited among the brethren themselves.\nWhat was to be done by the apostles in such circumstances? Should they not\nhave dissembled for a time, or rather have rejected and deserted that\nGospel which appeared to be the nursery of so many disputes, the cause of\nso many dangers, the occasion of so many offences? But in such\ndifficulties as these, their minds were relieved by this reflection, that\nChrist is the “stone of stumbling and rock of offence,”(55) “set for the\nfall and rising again of many, and for a sign which shall be spoken\nagainst;”(56) and armed with this confidence, they proceeded boldly\nthrough all the dangers of tumults and offences. The same consideration\nshould support us, since Paul declares it to be the perpetual character of\nthe Gospel, that it is “a savour of death unto death in them that\nperish,”(57) although it was rather given us to be the “savour of life\nunto life,” and “the power of God to” the “salvation” of the faithful;(58)\nwhich we also should certainly experience it to be, if we did not corrupt\nthis eminent gift of God by our ingratitude, and pervert to our\ndestruction what ought to be a principal instrument of our salvation.\nBut I return to you, Sire. Let not your Majesty be at all moved by those\ngroundless accusations with which our adversaries endeavour to terrify\nyou; as that the sole tendency and design of this new Gospel—for so they\ncall it—is to furnish a pretext for seditions, and to gain impunity for\nall crimes. “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace;”(59)\nnor is “the Son of God,” who came to “destroy the works of the devil, the\nminister of sin.”(60) And it is unjust to charge us with such motives and\ndesigns, of which we have never given cause for the least suspicion. Is it\nprobable that we are meditating the subversion of kingdoms?—we, who were\nnever heard to utter a factious word, whose lives were ever known to be\npeaceable and honest while we lived under your government, and who, even\nnow in our exile, cease not to pray for all prosperity to attend yourself\nand your kingdom! Is it probable that we are seeking an unlimited license\nto commit crimes with impunity? in whose conduct, though many things may\nbe blamed, yet there is nothing worthy of such severe reproach! Nor have\nwe, by Divine Grace, profited so little in the Gospel, but that our life\nmay be an example to our detractors of chastity, liberality, mercy,\ntemperance, patience, modesty, and every other virtue. It is an undeniable\nfact, that we sincerely fear and worship God, whose name we desire to be\nsanctified both by our life and by our death; and envy itself is\nconstrained to bear testimony to the innocence and civil integrity of some\nof us, who have suffered the punishment of death for that very thing which\nought to be accounted their highest praise. But if the Gospel be made a\npretext for tumults, which has not yet happened in your kingdom; if any\npersons make the liberty of divine grace an excuse for the licentiousness\nof their vices, of whom I have known many,—there are laws and legal\npenalties, by which they may be punished according to their deserts; only\nlet not the Gospel of God be reproached for the crimes of wicked men. You\nhave now, Sire, the virulent iniquity of our calumniators laid before you\nin a sufficient number of instances, that you may not receive their\naccusations with too credulous an ear.—I fear I have gone too much into\nthe detail, as this preface already approaches the size of a full apology;\nwhereas I intended it not to contain our defence, but only to prepare your\nmind to attend to the pleading of our cause; for, though you are now\naverse and alienated from us, and even inflamed against us, we despair not\nof regaining your favour, if you will only once read with calmness and\ncomposure this our confession, which we intend as our defence before your\nMajesty. But, on the contrary, if your ears are so preoccupied with the\nwhispers of the malevolent, as to leave no opportunity for the accused to\nspeak for themselves, and if those outrageous furies, with your\nconnivance, continue to persecute with imprisonments, scourges, tortures,\nconfiscations, and flames, we shall indeed, like sheep destined to the\nslaughter, be reduced to the greatest extremities. Yet shall we in\npatience possess our souls, and wait for the mighty hand of the Lord,\nwhich undoubtedly will in time appear, and show itself armed for the\ndeliverance of the poor from their affliction, and for the punishment of\ntheir despisers, who now exult in such perfect security. May the Lord, the\nKing of kings, establish your throne with righteousness, and your kingdom\nwith equity.\nBASIL, _1st August, 1536_.\nGENERAL SYLLABUS.\nThe design of the Author in these Christian Institutes is twofold,\nrelating, First, to the knowledge of God, as the way to attain a blessed\nimmortality; and, in connection with and subservience to this, Secondly,\nto the knowledge of ourselves.\nIn the prosecution of this design, he strictly follows the method of the\nApostles’ Creed, as being most familiar to all Christians. For as the\nCreed consists of four parts, the first relating to God the Father, the\nsecond to the Son, the third to the Holy Spirit, the fourth to the Church;\nso the Author distributes the whole of this work into Four Books,\ncorresponding respectively to the four parts of the Creed; as will clearly\nappear from the following detail:—\nI. The first article of the Creed relates to God the Father, and to the\ncreation, conservation, and government of all things, which are included\nin his omnipotence.\nSo the first book is on the knowledge of God, considered as the Creator,\nPreserver, and Governor of the universe at large, and of every thing\ncontained in it. It shows both the nature and tendency of the true\nknowledge of the Creator—that this is not learned in the schools, but that\nevery man from his birth is self‐taught it—Yet that the depravity of men\nis so great as to corrupt and extinguish this knowledge, partly by\nignorance, partly by wickedness; so that it neither leads him to glorify\nGod as he ought, nor conducts him to the attainment of happiness—And\nthough this internal knowledge is assisted by all the creatures around,\nwhich serve as a mirror to display the Divine perfections, yet that man\ndoes not profit by it—Therefore, that to those, whom it is God’s will to\nbring to an intimate and saving knowledge of himself, he gives his written\nword; which introduces observations on the sacred Scripture—That he has\ntherein revealed himself; that not the Father only, but the Father, Son,\nand Holy Spirit, united, is the Creator of heaven and earth; whom neither\nthe knowledge innate by nature, nor the very beautiful mirror displayed to\nus in the world, can, in consequence of our depravity, teach us to know so\nas to glorify him. This gives occasion for treating of the revelation of\nGod in the Scripture, of the unity of the Divine Essence, and the trinity\nof Persons.—To prevent man from attributing to God the blame of his own\nvoluntary blindness, the Author shows the state of man at his creation,\nand treats of the image of God, free‐will, and the primitive integrity of\nnature.—Having finished the subject of creation, he proceeds to the\nconservation and government of all things, concluding the first book with\na full discussion of the doctrine of divine providence.\nII. But since man is fallen by sin from the state in which he was created,\nit is necessary to come to Christ. Therefore it follows in the Creed, “And\nin Jesus Christ, his only Son our Lord,” &c.\nSo in the second book of the Institutes our Author treats of the knowledge\nof God as the Redeemer in Christ; and having shown the fall of man, leads\nhim to Christ the Mediator. Here he states the doctrine of original\nsin—that man possesses no inherent strength to enable him to deliver\nhimself from sin and the impending curse, but that, on the contrary,\nnothing can proceed from him, antecedently to reconciliation and\nrenovation, but what is deserving of condemnation—Therefore, that, man\nbeing utterly lost in himself, and incapable of conceiving even a good\nthought by which he may restore himself, or perform actions acceptable to\nGod, he must seek redemption out of himself, in Christ—That the Law was\ngiven for this purpose, not to confine its observers to itself, but to\nconduct them to Christ; which gives occasion to introduce an exposition of\nthe Moral Law—That he was known, as the Author of salvation, to the Jews\nunder the Law, but more fully under the Gospel, in which he is manifested\nto the world.—Hence follows the doctrine of the similarity and difference\nof the Old and New Testament, of the Law and Gospel.—It is next stated,\nthat, in order to the complete accomplishment of salvation, it was\nnecessary for the eternal Son of God to become man, and that he actually\nassumed a real human nature:—it is also shown how these two natures\nconstitute one person—That the office of Christ, appointed for the\nacquisition and application of complete salvation by his merit and\nefficacy, is sacerdotal, regal, and prophetical.—Next follows the manner\nin which Christ executed his office, or actually performed the part of a\nMediator, being an exposition of the Articles respecting his death,\nresurrection, and ascension to heaven.—Lastly, the Author shows the truth\nand propriety of affirming that Christ merited the grace of God and\nsalvation for us.\nIII. As long as Christ is separate from us, he profits us nothing. Hence\nthe necessity of our being ingrafted into him, as branches into a vine.\nTherefore the doctrine concerning Christ is followed, in the third part of\nthe Creed, by this clause, “I believe in the Holy Spirit,” as being the\nbond of union between us and Christ.\nSo in the third book our Author treats of the Holy Spirit, who unites us\nto Christ—and consequently of faith, by which we embrace Christ, with his\ntwofold benefit, free righteousness, which he imputes to us, and\nregeneration, which he commences within us, by bestowing repentance upon\nus.—And to show that we have not the least room to glory in such faith as\nis unconnected with the pursuit of repentance, before proceeding to the\nfull discussion of justification, he treats at large of repentance and the\ncontinual exercise of it, which Christ, apprehended by faith, produces in\nus by his Spirit.—He next fully discusses the first and chief benefit of\nChrist when united to us by the Holy Spirit, that is, justification—and\nthen treats of prayer, which resembles the hand that actually receives\nthose blessings to be enjoyed, which faith knows, from the word of\npromise, to be laid up with God for our use.—But as all men are not united\nto Christ, the sole Author of salvation, by the Holy Spirit, who creates\nand preserves faith in us, he treats of God’s eternal election; which is\nthe cause that we, in whom he foresaw no good but what he intended freely\nto bestow, have been favoured with the gift of Christ, and united to God\nby the effectual call of the Gospel.—Lastly, he treats of complete\nregeneration, and the fruition of happiness; that is, the final\nresurrection, towards which our eyes must be directed, since in this world\nthe felicity of the pious, in respect of enjoyment, is only begun.\nIV. But as the Holy Spirit does not unite all men to Christ, or make them\npartakers of faith, and on those to whom he imparts it he does not\nordinarily bestow it without means, but employs for this purpose the\npreaching of the Gospel and the use of the sacraments, with the\nadministration of all discipline, therefore it follows in the Creed, “I\nbelieve in the Holy Catholic Church,” whom, though involved in eternal\ndeath, yet, in pursuance of the gratuitous election, God has freely\nreconciled to himself in Christ, and made partakers of the Holy Spirit,\nthat, being ingrafted into Christ, they may have communion with him as\ntheir head, whence flows a perpetual remission of sins, and a full\nrestoration to eternal life.\nSo in the fourth book our Author treats of the Church—then of the means\nused by the Holy Spirit in effectually calling from spiritual death, and\npreserving the church—the word and sacraments—baptism and the Lord’s\nsupper—which are as it were Christ’s regal sceptre, by which he commences\nhis spiritual reign in the Church by the energy of his Spirit, and carries\nit forwards from day to day during the present life, after the close of\nwhich he perfects it without those means.\nAnd as political institutions are the asylums of the Church in this life,\nthough civil government is distinct from the spiritual kingdom of Christ,\nour Author instructs us respecting it as a signal blessing of God, which\nthe Church ought to acknowledge with gratitude of heart, till we are\ncalled out of this transitory state to the heavenly inheritance, where God\nwill be all in all.\nThis is the plan of the Institutes, which may be comprised in the\nfollowing brief summary:—\nMan, created originally upright, being afterwards ruined, not partially,\nbut totally, finds salvation out of himself, wholly in Christ; to whom\nbeing united by the Holy Spirit, freely bestowed, without any regard of\nfuture works, he enjoys in him a twofold benefit, the perfect imputation\nof righteousness, which attends him to the grave, and the commencement of\nsanctification, which he daily increases, till at length he completes it\nat the day of regeneration or resurrection of the body, so that in eternal\nlife and the heavenly inheritance his praises are celebrated for such\nstupendous mercy."

          "title": "Chapter I. The Connection Between The Knowledge Of God And The Knowledge",
          "content": "Of Ourselves.\nTrue and substantial wisdom principally consists of two parts, the\nknowledge of God, and the knowledge of ourselves. But, while these two\nbranches of knowledge are so intimately connected, which of them precedes\nand produces the other, is not easy to discover. For, in the first place,\nno man can take a survey of himself but he must immediately turn to the\ncontemplation of God, in whom he “lives and moves;”(61) since it is\nevident that the talents which we possess are not from ourselves, and that\nour very existence is nothing but a subsistence in God alone. These\nbounties, distilling to us by drops from heaven, form, as it were, so many\nstreams conducting us to the fountain‐head. Our poverty conduces to a\nclearer display of the infinite fulness of God. Especially, the miserable\nruin, into which we have been plunged by the defection of the first man,\ncompels us to raise our eyes towards heaven, not only as hungry and\nfamished, to seek thence a supply for our wants, but, aroused with fear,\nto learn humility. For, since man is subject to a world of miseries, and\nhas been spoiled of his divine array, this melancholy exposure discovers\nan immense mass of deformity: every one, therefore, must be so impressed\nwith a consciousness of his own infelicity, as to arrive at some knowledge\nof God. Thus a sense of our ignorance, vanity, poverty, infirmity,\ndepravity, and corruption, leads us to perceive and acknowledge that in\nthe Lord alone are to be found true wisdom, solid strength, perfect\ngoodness, and unspotted righteousness; and so, by our imperfections, we\nare excited to a consideration of the perfections of God. Nor can we\nreally aspire toward him, till we have begun to be displeased with\nourselves. For who would not gladly rest satisfied with himself? where is\nthe man not actually absorbed in self‐complacency, while he remains\nunacquainted with his true situation, or content with his own endowments,\nand ignorant or forgetful of his own misery? The knowledge of ourselves,\ntherefore, is not only an incitement to seek after God, but likewise a\nconsiderable assistance towards finding him.\nII. On the other hand, it is plain that no man can arrive at the true\nknowledge of himself, without having first contemplated the divine\ncharacter, and then descended to the consideration of his own. For, such\nis the native pride of us all, we invariably esteem ourselves righteous,\ninnocent, wise, and holy, till we are convinced, by clear proofs, of our\nunrighteousness, turpitude, folly, and impurity. But we are never thus\nconvinced, while we confine our attention to ourselves, and regard not the\nLord, who is the only standard by which this judgment ought to be formed.\nBecause, from our natural proneness to hypocrisy, any vain appearance of\nrighteousness abundantly contents us instead of the reality; and, every\nthing within and around us being exceedingly defiled, we are delighted\nwith what is least so, as extremely pure, while we confine our reflections\nwithin the limits of human corruption. So the eye, accustomed to see\nnothing but black, judges that to be very white, which is but whitish, or\nperhaps brown. Indeed, the senses of our bodies may assist us in\ndiscovering how grossly we err in estimating the powers of the soul. For\nif at noon‐day we look either on the ground, or at any surrounding\nobjects, we conclude our vision to be very strong and piercing; but when\nwe raise our eyes and steadily look at the sun, they are at once dazzled\nand confounded with such a blaze of brightness, and we are constrained to\nconfess, that our sight, so piercing in viewing terrestrial things, when\ndirected to the sun, is dimness itself. Thus also it happens in the\nconsideration of our spiritual endowments. For as long as our views are\nbounded by the earth, perfectly content with our own righteousness,\nwisdom, and strength, we fondly flatter ourselves, and fancy we are little\nless than demigods. But, if we once elevate our thoughts to God, and\nconsider his nature, and the consummate perfection of his righteousness,\nwisdom, and strength, to which we ought to be conformed,—what before\ncharmed us in ourselves under the false pretext of righteousness, will\nsoon be loathed as the greatest iniquity; what strangely deceived us under\nthe title of wisdom, will be despised as extreme folly; and what wore the\nappearance of strength, will be proved to be most wretched impotence. So\nvery remote from the divine purity is what seems in us the highest\nperfection.\nIII. Hence that horror and amazement with which the Scripture always\nrepresents the saints to have been impressed and disturbed, on every\ndiscovery of the presence of God. For when we see those, who before his\nappearance stood secure and firm, so astonished and affrighted at the\nmanifestation of his glory, as to faint and almost expire through fear,—we\nmust infer that man is never sufficiently affected with a knowledge of his\nown meanness, till he has compared himself with the Divine Majesty. Of\nthis consternation we have frequent examples in the Judges and Prophets;\nso that it was a common expression among the Lord’s people—“We shall die,\nbecause we have seen God.”(62) Therefore the history of Job, to humble men\nwith a consciousness of their pollution, impotence, and folly, derives its\nprincipal argument from a description of the Divine purity, power, and\nwisdom. And not without reason. For we see how Abraham, the nearer he\napproached to behold the glory of the Lord, the more fully acknowledged\nhimself to be but “dust and ashes;”(63) and how Elias(64) could not bear\nhis approach without covering his face, his appearance is so formidable.\nAnd what can man do, all vile and corrupt, when fear constrains even the\ncherubim themselves to veil their faces? This is what the prophet Isaiah\nspeaks of—“the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the\nLord of hosts shall reign:”(65) that is, when he shall make a fuller and\nnearer exhibition of his splendour, it shall eclipse the splendour of the\nbrightest object besides. But, though the knowledge of God and the\nknowledge of ourselves be intimately connected, the proper order of\ninstruction requires us first to treat of the former, and then to proceed\nto the discussion of the latter."

          "title": "Chapter II. The Nature And Tendency Of The Knowledge Of God.",
          "content": "By the knowledge of God, I intend not merely a notion that there is such a\nBeing, but also an acquaintance with whatever we ought to know concerning\nHim, conducing to his glory and our benefit. For we cannot with propriety\nsay, there is any knowledge of God where there is no religion or piety. I\nhave no reference here to that species of knowledge by which men, lost and\ncondemned in themselves, apprehend God the Redeemer in Christ the\nMediator; but only to that first and simple knowledge, to which the\ngenuine order of nature would lead us, if Adam had retained his innocence.\nFor though, in the present ruined state of human nature, no man will ever\nperceive God to be a Father, or the Author of salvation, or in any respect\npropitious, but as pacified by the mediation of Christ; yet it is one\nthing to understand, that God our Maker supports us by his power, governs\nus by his providence, nourishes us by his goodness, and follows us with\nblessings of every kind, and another to embrace the grace of\nreconciliation proposed to us in Christ. Therefore, since God is first\nmanifested, both in the structure of the world and in the general tenor of\nScripture, simply as the Creator, and afterwards reveals himself in the\nperson of Christ as a Redeemer, hence arises a twofold knowledge of him;\nof which the former is first to be considered, and the other will follow\nin its proper place. For though our mind cannot conceive of God, without\nascribing some worship to him, it will not be sufficient merely to\napprehend that he is the only proper object of universal worship and\nadoration, unless we are also persuaded that he is the fountain of all\ngood, and seek for none but in him. This I maintain, not only because he\nsustains the universe, as he once made it, by his infinite power, governs\nit by his wisdom, preserves it by his goodness, and especially reigns over\nthe human race in righteousness and judgment, exercising a merciful\nforbearance, and defending them by his protection; but because there\ncannot be found the least particle of wisdom, light, righteousness, power,\nrectitude, or sincere truth which does not proceed from him, and claim him\nfor its author: we should therefore learn to expect and supplicate all\nthese things from him, and thankfully to acknowledge what he gives us. For\nthis sense of the divine perfections is calculated to teach us piety,\nwhich produces religion. By piety, I mean a reverence and love of God,\narising from a knowledge of his benefits. For, till men are sensible that\nthey owe every thing to God, that they are supported by his paternal care,\nthat he is the Author of all the blessings they enjoy, and that nothing\nshould be sought independently of him, they will never voluntarily submit\nto his authority; they will never truly and cordially devote themselves to\nhis service, unless they rely upon him alone for true felicity.\nII. Cold and frivolous, then, are the speculations of those who employ\nthemselves in disquisitions on the essence of God, when it would be more\ninteresting to us to become acquainted with his character, and to know\nwhat is agreeable to his nature. For what end is answered by professing,\nwith Epicurus, that there is a God, who, discarding all concern about the\nworld, indulges himself in perpetual inactivity? What benefit arises from\nthe knowledge of a God with whom we have no concern? Our knowledge of God\nshould rather tend, first, to teach us fear and reverence; and, secondly,\nto instruct us to implore all good at his hand, and to render him the\npraise of all that we receive. For how can you entertain a thought of God\nwithout immediately reflecting, that, being a creature of his formation,\nyou must, by right of creation, be subject to his authority? that you are\nindebted to him for your life, and that all your actions should be done\nwith reference to him? If this be true, it certainly follows that your\nlife is miserably corrupt, unless it be regulated by a desire of obeying\nhim, since his will ought to be the rule of our conduct. Nor can you have\na clear view of him without discovering him to be the fountain and origin\nof all good. This would produce a desire of union to him, and confidence\nin him, if the human mind were not seduced by its own depravity from the\nright path of investigation. For, even at the first, the pious mind dreams\nnot of any imaginary deity, but contemplates only the one true God; and,\nconcerning him, indulges not the fictions of fancy, but, content with\nbelieving him to be such as he reveals himself, uses the most diligent and\nunremitting caution, lest it should fall into error by a rash and\npresumptuous transgression of his will. He who thus knows him, sensible\nthat all things are subject to his control, confides in him as his\nGuardian and Protector, and unreservedly commits himself to his care.\nAssured that he is the author of all blessings, in distress or want he\nimmediately flies to his protection, and expects his aid. Persuaded of his\ngoodness and mercy, he relies on him with unlimited confidence, nor doubts\nof finding in his clemency a remedy provided for all his evils. Knowing\nhim to be his Lord and Father, he concludes that he ought to mark his\ngovernment in all things, revere his majesty, endeavour to promote his\nglory, and obey his commands. Perceiving him to be a just Judge, armed\nwith severity for the punishment of crimes, he keeps his tribunal always\nin view, and is restrained by fear from provoking his wrath. Yet he is not\nso terrified at the apprehension of his justice, as to wish to evade it,\neven if escape were possible; but loves him as much in punishing the\nwicked as in blessing the pious, because he believes it as necessary to\nhis glory to punish the impious and abandoned, as to reward the righteous\nwith eternal life. Besides, he restrains himself from sin, not merely from\na dread of vengeance, but because he loves and reveres God as his Father,\nhonours and worships him as his Lord, and, even though there were no hell,\nwould shudder at the thought of offending him. See, then, the nature of\npure and genuine religion. It consists in faith, united with a serious\nfear of God, comprehending a voluntary reverence, and producing legitimate\nworship agreeable to the injunctions of the law. And this requires to be\nthe more carefully remarked, because men in general render to God a formal\nworship, but very few truly reverence him; while great ostentation in\nceremonies is universally displayed, but sincerity of heart is rarely to\nbe found."

          "title": "Chapter III. The Human Mind Naturally Endued With The Knowledge Of God.",
          "content": "We lay it down as a position not to be controverted, that the human mind,\neven by natural instinct, possesses some sense of a Deity. For that no man\nmight shelter himself under the pretext of ignorance, God hath given to\nall some apprehension of his existence,(66) the memory of which he\nfrequently and insensibly renews; so that, as men universally know that\nthere is a God, and that he is their Maker, they must be condemned by\ntheir own testimony, for not having worshipped him and consecrated their\nlives to his service. If we seek for ignorance of a Deity, it is nowhere\nmore likely to be found, than among tribes the most stupid and furthest\nfrom civilization. But, as the celebrated Cicero observes, there is no\nnation so barbarous, no race so savage, as not to be firmly persuaded of\nthe being of a God.(67) Even those who in other respects appear to differ\nbut little from brutes, always retain some sense of religion; so fully are\nthe minds of men possessed with this common principle, which is closely\ninterwoven with their original composition. Now, since there has never\nbeen a country or family, from the beginning of the world, totally\ndestitute of religion, it is a tacit confession, that some sense of the\nDivinity is inscribed on every heart. Of this opinion, idolatry itself\nfurnishes ample proof. For we know how reluctantly man would degrade\nhimself to exalt other creatures above him. His preference of worshipping\na piece of wood or stone, to being thought to have no god, evinces the\nimpression of a Deity on the human mind to be very strong, the\nobliteration of which is more difficult than a total change of the natural\ndisposition; and this is certainly changed, whenever man leaves his\nnatural pride, and voluntarily descends to such meannesses under the\nnotion of worshipping God.\nII. It is most absurd, then, to pretend, as is asserted by some, that\nreligion was the contrivance of a few subtle and designing men, a\npolitical machine to confine the simple multitude to their duty, while\nthose who inculcated the worship of God on others, were themselves far\nfrom believing that any god existed. I confess, indeed, that artful men\nhave introduced many inventions into religion, to fill the vulgar with\nreverence, and strike them with terror, in order to obtain the greater\ncommand over their minds. But this they never could have accomplished, if\nthe minds of men had not previously been possessed of a firm persuasion of\nthe existence of God, from which the propensity to religion proceeds. And\nthat they who cunningly imposed on the illiterate, under the pretext of\nreligion, were themselves wholly destitute of any knowledge of God, is\nquite incredible. For though there were some in ancient times, and many\narise in the present age, who deny the existence of God, yet, in spite of\ntheir reluctance, they are continually receiving proofs of what they\ndesire to disbelieve. We read of no one guilty of more audacious or\nunbridled contempt of the Deity than Caligula; yet no man ever trembled\nwith greater distress at any instance of Divine wrath, so that he was\nconstrained to dread the Divinity whom he professed to despise. This you\nmay always see exemplified in persons of similar character. For the most\naudacious contemners of God are most alarmed, even at the noise of a\nfalling leaf. Whence arises this, but from the vengeance of the Divine\nMajesty, smiting their consciences the more powerfully in proportion to\ntheir efforts to fly from it? They try every refuge to hide themselves\nfrom the Lord’s presence, and to efface it from their minds; but their\nattempts to elude it are all in vain. Though it may seem to disappear for\na moment, it presently returns with increased violence; so that, if they\nhave any remission of the anguish of conscience, it resembles the sleep of\npersons intoxicated, or subject to frenzy, who enjoy no placid rest while\nsleeping, being continually harassed with horrible and tremendous dreams.\nThe impious themselves, therefore, exemplify the observation, that the\nidea of a God is never lost in the human mind.\nIII. It will always be evident to persons of correct judgment, that the\nidea of a Deity impressed on the mind of man is indelible. That all have\nby nature an innate persuasion of the Divine existence, a persuasion\ninseparable from their very constitution, we have abundant evidence in the\ncontumacy of the wicked, whose furious struggles to extricate themselves\nfrom the fear of God are unavailing. Though Diagoras, and others like him,\nturn to ridicule what all ages have believed of religion;(68) though\nDionysius scoff at the judgment of Heaven,—it is but a forced laughter,\nfor the worm of a guilty conscience torments them within, worse than if\nthey were seared with hot irons. I agree not with Cicero, that errors in\nprocess of time become obsolete, and that religion is increased and\nameliorated daily. For the world, as will shortly be observed, uses its\nutmost endeavours to banish all knowledge of God, and tries every method\nof corrupting his worship. I only maintain, that while the stupid\ninsensibility which the wicked wish to acquire, to promote their contempt\nof God, preys upon their minds, yet the sense of a Deity, which they\nardently desire to extinguish, is still strong, and frequently discovers\nitself. Whence we infer, that this is a doctrine, not first to be learned\nin the schools, but which every man from his birth is self‐taught, and\nwhich, though many strain every nerve to banish it from them, yet nature\nitself permits none to forget. Now, if the end for which all men are born\nand live, be to know God,—and unless the knowledge of God have reached\nthis point, it is uncertain and vain,—it is evident, that all who direct\nnot every thought and action of life to this end, are degenerated from the\nlaw of their creation. Of this the heathen philosophers themselves were\nnot ignorant. This was Plato’s meaning, when he taught that the chief good\nof the soul consists in similitude to God, when the soul, having a clear\nknowledge of him, is wholly transformed into his likeness.(69) The\nreasoning also of Gryllus, in Plutarch, is very accurate, when he affirms,\nthat men entirely destitute of religion, not only do not excel the brutes,\nbut are in many respects far more wretched, being obnoxious to evil under\nso many forms, and always dragging on a tumultuous and restless life. The\nworship of God is therefore the only thing which renders men superior to\nbrutes, and makes them aspire to immortality."

          "title": "Chapter IV. This Knowledge Extinguished Or Corrupted, Partly By Ignorance,",
          "content": "Partly By Wickedness.\nWhile experience testifies that the seeds of religion are sown by God in\nevery heart, we scarcely find one man in a hundred who cherishes what he\nhas received, and not one in whom they grow to maturity, much less bear\nfruit in due season. Some perhaps grow vain in their own superstitions,\nwhile others revolt from God with intentional wickedness; but all\ndegenerate from the true knowledge of him. The fact is, that no genuine\npiety remains in the world. But, in saying that some fall into\nsuperstition through error, I would not insinuate that their ignorance\nexcuses them from guilt; because their blindness is always connected with\npride, vanity, and contumacy. Pride and vanity are discovered, when\nmiserable men, in seeking after God, rise not, as they ought, above their\nown level, but judge of him according to their carnal stupidity, and leave\nthe proper path of investigation in pursuit of speculations as vain as\nthey are curious. Their conceptions of him are formed, not according to\nthe representations he gives of himself, but by the inventions of their\nown presumptuous imaginations. This gulf being opened, whatever course\nthey take, they must be rushing forwards to destruction. None of their\nsubsequent attempts for the worship or service of God can be considered as\nrendered to him; because they worship not him, but a figment of their own\nbrains in his stead. This depravity Paul expressly remarks: “Professing\nthemselves to be wise, they became fools.”(70) He had before said, “they\nbecame vain in their imaginations.” But lest any should exculpate them, he\nadds that they were deservedly blinded, because, not content within the\nbounds of sobriety, but arrogating to themselves more than was right, they\nwilfully darkened, and even infatuated themselves with pride, vanity, and\nperverseness. Whence it follows, that their folly is inexcusable, which\noriginates not only in a vain curiosity, but in false confidence, and an\nimmoderate desire to exceed the limits of human knowledge.\nII. David’s assertion, that “the fool hath said in his heart, There is no\nGod,”(71) is primarily, as we shall soon see in another place, to be\nrestricted to those who extinguish the light of nature, and wilfully\nstupefy themselves. For we see many, become hardened by bold and habitual\ntransgressions, striving to banish all remembrance of God, which the\ninstinct of nature is still suggesting to their minds. To render their\nmadness more detestable, he introduces them as expressly denying the\nexistence of God; not that they deprive him of his being, but because they\nrob him of his justice and providence, shutting him up as an idler in\nheaven. Now, as nothing would be more inconsistent with Deity, than to\nabandon the government of the world, leave it to fortune, and connive at\nthe crimes of men, that they might wanton with impunity,—whoever\nextinguishes all fear of the heavenly judgment, and indulges himself in\nsecurity, denies that there is any God. After the impious have wilfully\nshut their own eyes, it is the righteous vengeance of God upon them, to\ndarken their understandings, so that, seeing, they may not perceive.(72)\nDavid is the best interpreter of his own meaning, in another place, where\nhe says, “The wicked have no fear of God before their eyes;”(73) and\nagain, that they encourage themselves in their iniquities with the\nflattering persuasion that God doth not see them.(74) Though they are\nconstrained to acknowledge the existence of God, yet they rob him of his\nglory, by detracting from his power. For as God, according to the\ntestimony of Paul, “cannot deny himself,”(75) because he perpetually\nremains like himself,—those who feign him to be a vain and lifeless image,\nare truly said to deny God. It must also be remarked, that, though they\nstrive against their own natural understanding, and desire not only to\nbanish him thence, but even to annihilate him in heaven, their\ninsensibility can never prevail, so as to prevent God from sometimes\nrecalling them to his tribunal. But as no dread restrains them from\nviolent opposition to the divine will, it is evident, as long as they are\ncarried away with such a blind impetuosity, that they are governed by a\nbrutish forgetfulness of God.\nIII. Thus is overthrown the vain excuse pleaded by many for their\nsuperstition; for they satisfy themselves with any attention to religion,\nhowever preposterous, not considering that the Divine Will is the\nperpetual rule to which true religion ought to be conformed; that God ever\ncontinues like himself; that he is no spectre or phantasm, to be\nmetamorphosed according to the fancy of every individual. It is easy to\nsee how superstition mocks God with hypocritical services, while it\nattempts to please him. For, embracing only those things which he declares\nhe disregards, it either contemptuously practises, or even openly rejects,\nwhat he prescribes and declares to be pleasing in his sight. Persons who\nintroduce newly‐invented methods of worshipping God, really worship and\nadore the creature of their distempered imaginations; for they would never\nhave dared to trifle in such a manner with God, if they had not first\nfeigned a god conformable to their own false and foolish notions.\nWherefore the apostle pronounces a vague and unsettled notion concerning\nthe Deity to be ignorance of God. “When ye knew not God, (says he,) ye did\nservice unto them which by nature were no gods.”(76) And in another place\nhe speaks of the Ephesians as having been “without God,”(77) while they\nwere strangers to a right knowledge of the only true God. Nor, in this\nrespect, is it of much importance, whether you imagine to yourself one god\nor more; for in either case you depart and revolt from the true God, and,\nforsaking him, you have nothing left you but an execrable idol. We must\ntherefore decide, with Lactantius, that there is no legitimate religion\nunconnected with truth.\nIV. Another sin is, that they never think of God but against their\ninclinations, nor approach him till their reluctance is overcome by\nconstraint; and then they are influenced, not by a voluntary fear,\nproceeding from reverence of the Divine Majesty, but by a servile and\nconstrained fear, extorted by the divine judgment, which they dread\nbecause it is inevitable, at the same time that they hate it. Now, to\nimpiety, and to this species of it alone, is applicable that assertion of\nStatius, that fear first made gods in the world.(78) They, whose minds are\nalienated from the righteousness of God, earnestly desire the subversion\nof that tribunal, which they know to be established for the punishment of\ntransgressions against it. With this disposition, they wage war against\nthe Lord, who cannot be deprived of his judgment; but when they apprehend\nhis irresistible arm to be impending over their heads, unable to avert or\nevade it, they tremble with fear. That they may not seem altogether to\ndespise him, whose majesty troubles them, they practise some form of\nreligion; at the same time not ceasing to pollute themselves with vices of\nevery kind, and to add one flagitious act to another, till they have\nviolated every part of God’s holy law, and dissipated all its\nrighteousness. It is certain, at least, that they are not prevented by\nthat pretended fear of God from enjoying pleasure and satisfaction in\ntheir sins, practising self‐adulation, and preferring the indulgence of\ntheir own carnal intemperance to the salutary restraints of the Holy\nSpirit. But that being a false and vain shadow of religion, and scarcely\nworthy even to be called its shadow,—it is easy to infer the wide\ndifference between such a confused notion of God, and the piety which is\ninstilled only into the minds of the faithful, and is the source of\nreligion. Yet hypocrites, who are flying from God, resort to the artifices\nof superstition, for the sake of appearing devoted to him. For whereas the\nwhole tenor of their life ought to be a perpetual course of obedience to\nhim, they make no scruple of rebelling against him in almost all their\nactions, only endeavouring to appease him with a few paltry sacrifices.\nWhereas he ought to be served with sanctity of life and integrity of\nheart, they invent frivolous trifles and worthless observances, to\nconciliate his favour. They abandon themselves to their impurities with\nthe greater licentiousness, because they confide in being able to\ndischarge all their duty to him by ridiculous expiations. In a word,\nwhereas their confidence ought to be placed on him, they neglect him, and\ndepend upon themselves or on other creatures. At length they involve\nthemselves in such a vast accumulation of errors, that those sparks which\nenable them to discover the glory of God are smothered, and at last\nextinguished by the criminal darkness of iniquity. That seed, which it is\nimpossible to eradicate, a sense of the existence of a Deity, yet remains;\nbut so corrupted as to produce only the worst of fruits. Yet this is a\nfurther proof of what I now contend for, that an idea of God is naturally\nengraved on the hearts of men, since necessity extorts a confession of it,\neven from reprobates themselves. In the moment of tranquillity, they\nfacetiously mock the Divine Being, and with loquacious impertinence\nderogate from his power. But if any despair oppress them, it stimulates\nthem to seek him, and dictates concise prayers, which prove that they are\nnot altogether ignorant of God, but that what ought to have appeared\nbefore had been suppressed by obstinacy."

          "title": "Chapter V. The Knowledge Of God Conspicuous In The Formation And Continual",
          "content": "Government Of The World.\nAs the perfection of a happy life consists in the knowledge of God, that\nno man might be precluded from attaining felicity, God hath not only sown\nin the minds of men the seed of religion, already mentioned, but hath\nmanifested himself in the formation of every part of the world, and daily\npresents himself to public view, in such a manner, that they cannot open\ntheir eyes without being constrained to behold him. His essence indeed is\nincomprehensible, so that his Majesty is not to be perceived by the human\nsenses; but on all his works he hath inscribed his glory in characters so\nclear, unequivocal, and striking, that the most illiterate and stupid\ncannot exculpate themselves by the plea of ignorance. The Psalmist\ntherefore, with great propriety, exclaims, “He covereth himself with light\nas with a garment;”(79) as if he had said, that his first appearance in\nvisible apparel was at the creation of the world, when he displayed those\nglories which are still conspicuous on every side. In the same place, the\nPsalmist compares the expanded heavens to a royal pavilion;—he says that\n“he layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; maketh the clouds his\nchariot; walketh upon the wings of the wind;” and maketh the winds and the\nlightnings his swift messengers. And because the glory of his power and\nwisdom is more refulgently displayed above, heaven is generally called his\npalace. And, in the first place, whithersoever you turn your eyes, there\nis not an atom of the world in which you cannot behold some brilliant\nsparks at least of his glory. But you cannot at one view take a survey of\nthis most ample and beautiful machine in all its vast extent, without\nbeing completely overwhelmed with its infinite splendour. Wherefore the\nauthor of the Epistle to the Hebrews elegantly represents the worlds as\nthe manifestations of invisible things;(80) for the exact symmetry of the\nuniverse is a mirror, in which we may contemplate the otherwise invisible\nGod. For which reason the Psalmist(81) attributes to the celestial bodies\na language universally known; for they afford a testimony of the Deity too\nevident to escape the observation even of the most ignorant people in the\nworld. But the Apostle more distinctly asserts this manifestation to men\nof what was useful to be known concerning God; “for the invisible things\nof him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood\nby the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead.”(82)\nII. Of his wonderful wisdom, both heaven and earth contain innumerable\nproofs; not only those more abstruse things, which are the subjects of\nastronomy, medicine, and the whole science of physics, but those things\nwhich force themselves on the view of the most illiterate of mankind, so\nthat they cannot open their eyes without being constrained to witness\nthem. Adepts, indeed, in those liberal arts, or persons just initiated\ninto them, are thereby enabled to proceed much further in investigating\nthe secrets of Divine Wisdom. Yet ignorance of those sciences prevents no\nman from such a survey of the workmanship of God, as is more than\nsufficient to excite his admiration of the Divine Architect. In\ndisquisitions concerning the motions of the stars, in fixing their\nsituations, measuring their distances, and distinguishing their peculiar\nproperties, there is need of skill, exactness, and industry; and the\nprovidence of God being more clearly revealed by these discoveries, the\nmind ought to rise to a sublimer elevation for the contemplation of his\nglory. But since the meanest and most illiterate of mankind, who are\nfurnished with no other assistance than their own eyes, cannot be ignorant\nof the excellence of the Divine skill, exhibiting itself in that endless,\nyet regular variety of the innumerable celestial host,—it is evident, that\nthe Lord abundantly manifests his wisdom to every individual on earth.\nThus it belongs to a man of preëminent ingenuity to examine, with the\ncritical exactness of Galen, the connection, the symmetry, the beauty, and\nthe use of the various parts of the human body. But the composition of the\nhuman body is universally acknowledged to be so ingenious, as to render\nits Maker the object of deserved admiration.\nIII. And therefore some of the philosophers(83) of antiquity have justly\ncalled man a microcosm, or world in miniature; because he is an eminent\nspecimen of the power, goodness, and wisdom of God, and contains in him\nwonders enough to occupy the attention of our minds, if we are not\nindisposed to such a study. For this reason, Paul, having remarked that\nthe blind “might feel after God and find him,” immediately adds, that “he\nis not far from every one of us;”(84) because every man has undoubtedly an\ninward perception of the celestial goodness, by which he is quickened. But\nif, to attain some ideas of God, it be not necessary for us to go beyond\nourselves, what an unpardonable indolence is it in those who will not\ndescend into themselves that they may find him! For the same reason,\nDavid, having briefly celebrated the wonderful name and honour of God,\nwhich are universally conspicuous, immediately exclaims, “What is man,\nthat thou art mindful of him?”(85) Again, “Out of the mouths of babes and\nsucklings thou hast ordained strength.” Thus declaring not only that the\nhuman race is a clear mirror of the works of God, but that even infants at\nthe breast have tongues so eloquent for the publication of his glory, that\nthere is no necessity for other orators; whence he hesitates not to\nproduce them as fully capable of confuting the madness of those whose\ndiabolical pride would wish to extinguish the name of God. Hence also what\nPaul quotes from Aratus, that “we are the offspring of God;”(86) since his\nadorning us with such great excellence has proved him to be our Father.\nSo, from the dictates of common sense and experience, the heathen poets\ncalled him the Father of men. Nor will any man freely devote himself to\nthe service of God, unless he have been allured to love and reverence him,\nby first experiencing his paternal love.\nIV. But herein appears the vile ingratitude of men—that, while they ought\nto be proclaiming the praises of God for the wonderful skill displayed in\ntheir formation, and the inestimable bounties he bestows on them, they are\nonly inflated with the greater pride. They perceive how wonderfully God\nworks within them, and experience teaches them what a variety of blessings\nthey receive from his liberality. They are constrained to know, whether\nwillingly or not, that these are proofs of his divinity: yet they suppress\nthis knowledge in their hearts. Indeed, they need not go out of\nthemselves, provided they do not, by arrogating to themselves what is\ngiven from heaven, smother the light which illuminates their minds to a\nclearer discovery of God. Even in the present day, there are many men of\nmonstrous dispositions, who hesitate not to pervert all the seeds of\ndivinity sown in the nature of man, in order to bury in oblivion the name\nof God. How detestable is this frenzy, that man, discovering in his body\nand soul a hundred vestiges of God, should make this very excellence a\npretext for the denial of his being! They will not say that they are\ndistinguished from the brutes by chance; but they ascribe it to nature,\nwhich they consider as the author of all things, and remove God out of\nsight. They perceive most exquisite workmanship in all their members, from\nthe head to the feet. Here also they substitute nature in the place of\nGod. But above all, the rapid motions of the soul, its noble faculties,\nand excellent talents, discover a Divinity not easily concealed; unless\nthe Epicureans, like the Cyclops, from this eminence should audaciously\nwage war against God. Do all the treasures of heavenly wisdom concur in\nthe government of a worm five feet in length? and shall the universe be\ndestitute of this privilege? To state that there is in the soul a certain\nmachinery corresponding to every part of the body, is so far from\nobscuring the divine glory, that it is rather an illustration of it. Let\nEpicurus answer; what concourse of atoms in the concoction of food and\ndrink distributes part into excrements and part into blood, and causes the\nseveral members to perform their different offices with as much diligence\nas if so many souls by common consent governed one body?\nV. But my present concern is not with that sty of swines: I rather address\nthose who, influenced by preposterous subtilties, would indirectly employ\nthat frigid dogma of Aristotle to destroy the immortality of the soul, and\ndeprive God of his rights. For, because the organs of the body are\ndirected by the faculties of the soul, they pretend the soul to be so\nunited to the body as to be incapable of subsisting without it; and by\ntheir eulogies of nature do all they can to suppress the name of God. But\nthe powers of the soul are far from being limited to functions subservient\nto the body. For what concern has the body in measuring the heavens,\ncounting the number of the stars, computing their several magnitudes, and\nacquiring a knowledge of their respective distances, of the celerity or\ntardiness of their courses, and of the degrees of their various\ndeclinations? I grant, indeed, the usefulness of astronomy, but only\nremark that, in these profound researches relating to the celestial orbs,\nthere is no corporeal coöperation, but that the soul has its functions\ndistinct from the body. I have proposed one example, whence inferences may\nreadily be drawn by the readers. The manifold agility of the soul, which\nenables it to take a survey of heaven and earth; to join the past and the\npresent; to retain the memory of things heard long ago; to conceive of\nwhatever it chooses by the help of imagination; its ingenuity also in the\ninvention of such admirable arts,—are certain proofs of the divinity in\nman. Besides, in sleep, it not only turns and moves itself round, but\nconceives many useful ideas, reasons on various subjects, and even divines\nfuture events. What shall we say, but that the vestiges of immortality\nimpressed upon man are absolutely indelible? Now, what reason can be\ngiven, why man, who is of divine original, should not acknowledge his\nCreator? Shall we indeed, by the judgment with which we are endued,\ndiscern right from wrong, and shall there be no judge in heaven? Shall we,\neven in our sleep, have some remains of intelligence, and shall there be\nno God to govern the world? Shall we be esteemed the inventers of so many\nuseful arts, that God may be defrauded of his praise? Whereas experience\nabundantly teaches, that all we have is variously distributed to us by\nsome superior Being. The clamour of some, about a secret inspiration\nanimating the whole world, is not only weak, but altogether profane. They\nare pleased with the celebrated passage of Virgil—\n“Know, first, a spirit, with an active flame,\nFills, feeds, and animates this mighty frame;\nRuns through the watery worlds, the fields of air,\nThe ponderous earth, the depths of heaven; and there\nGlows in the sun and moon, and burns in every star.\nThus, mingling with the mass, the general soul\nLives in the parts, and agitates the whole.\nFrom that celestial energy began\nThe low‐browed brute, th’ imperial race of man,\nThe painted birds who wing th’ aërial plain,\nAnd all the mighty monsters of the main;\nTheir souls at first from high Olympus came,” &c.(87)\nJust as if the world, which is a theatre erected for displaying the glory\nof God, were its own creator! For thus writes the same poet in another\nplace, following the common opinion of the Greeks and Latins—\n“Led by such wonders, sages have opined,\nThat bees have portions of a heavenly mind;\nThat God pervades, and, like one common soul,\nFills, feeds, and animates the world’s great whole;\nThat flocks, herds, beasts, and men, from him receive\nTheir vital breath; in him all move and live;\nThat souls discerpt from him shall never die,\nBut back resolved to God and heaven shall fly,\nAnd live for ever in the starry sky.”(88)\nSee the efficacy of that jejune speculation concerning a universal mind\nanimating and actuating the world, in the production and encouragement of\npiety in the human heart. This more fully appears also from the profane\nexpressions of the filthy Lucretius, which are deductions from the same\nprinciple.(89) Its true tendency is to set up a shadowy deity, and to\nbanish all ideas of the true God, the proper object of fear and worship. I\nconfess, indeed, that the expression, that nature is God, may be used in a\npious sense by a pious mind; but, as it is harsh and inconsistent with\nstrict propriety of speech, nature being rather an order prescribed by\nGod, it is dangerous in matters so momentous, and demanding peculiar\ncaution, to confound the Deity with the inferior course of his works.\nVI. Let us remember, then, in every consideration of our own nature, that\nthere is one God, who governs all natures, and who expects us to regard\nhim, to direct our faith to him, to worship and invoke him. For nothing is\nmore preposterous than to enjoy such splendid advantages, which proclaim\nwithin us their divine origin, and to neglect the Author who bountifully\nbestows them. Now, what illustrious specimens of his power have we to\narrest our attention! unless it be possible for us not to know what\nstrength is required to sustain with his word this immense fabric of\nheaven and earth; now by his mere nod to shake the heaven with roaring\npeals of thunder, to consume whatever he choose with lightnings, and set\nthe atmosphere on fire with the flame; now to disturb it with tempests in\nvarious forms, and immediately, if he please, to compose all to\ninstantaneous serenity; to restrain, suspended as it were in air, the sea,\nwhich, by its elevation, seems to threaten the earth with continual\ndevastation; now raising it in a tremendous manner, by the tumultuous\nviolence of the winds, and now appeasing the waves to render it calm. To\nthis purpose are the numerous praises of the power of God, drawn from the\ntestimonies of nature, particularly in the book of Job, and in the\nprophecies of Isaiah; which I now purposely omit, as they will be more\nsuitably introduced, when I discuss the scriptural account of the creation\nof the world. Only I wished at present to hint, that this way of seeking\nGod, by tracing the lineaments which, both above and below us, exhibit\nsuch a lively adumbration of him, is common to aliens, and to those who\nbelong to his family. His power leads us to the consideration of his\neternity; because he, from whom all things derive their origin, must\nnecessarily be eternal and self‐existent. But if we inquire the reason\nthat induced him first to create all things, and now to preserve them, we\nshall find the sole cause to be his own goodness. But though this be the\nonly cause, it should be more than sufficient to attract us to love him;\nsince, according to the Psalmist,(90) there is no creature that does not\nparticipate in the effusions of his mercy.\nVII. In the second species of his works, such as happen out of the\nordinary course of nature, the proofs of his perfections are equally\nclear. For he so regulates his providence in the government of human\nsociety, that, while he exhibits, in innumerable ways, his benignity and\nbeneficence to all, he likewise declares, by evident and daily\nindications, his clemency to the pious, and his severity to the wicked and\nungodly. For no doubt can be entertained respecting his punishment of\nflagitious crimes; inasmuch as he clearly demonstrates himself to be the\nguardian and avenger of innocence, in prospering with his blessing the\nlife of good men, in assisting their necessities, assuaging and comforting\ntheir sorrows, alleviating their calamities, and providing in all things\nfor their safety. Nor should it perplex or eclipse his perpetual rule of\nrighteousness, that he frequently permits the wicked and guilty for a time\nto exult in impunity; but suffers good men to be undeservedly harassed\nwith much adversity, and even to be oppressed by the iniquitous malice of\nthe ungodly. We ought rather to make a very different reflection; that,\nwhen he clearly manifests his wrath in the punishment of one sin, he hates\nall sins; and that, since he now passes by many sins unpunished, there\nwill be a judgment hereafter, till which the punishment is deferred. So,\nalso, what ample occasion he supplies us for the consideration of his\nmercy, while, with unwearied benignity, he pursues the miserable, calling\nthem back to himself with more than paternal indulgence, till his\nbeneficence overcomes their depravity!\nVIII. To this end the Psalmist,(91) mentioning that God, in desperate\ncases, suddenly and wonderfully succors, beyond all expectation, those who\nare miserable and ready to perish, either protecting from beasts of prey\nsuch as are wandering in deserts, and, at length, reconducting them into\nthe right way, or supplying with food the needy and hungry, or delivering\ncaptives from dreary dungeons and iron chains, or bringing the shipwrecked\nsafe into port, or healing the diseases of some who are almost dead, or\nscorching the earth with excessive heat and drought, or fertilizing it\nwith the secret showers of his mercy, or elevating the meanest of the\nvulgar, or degrading nobles from their dignified stations,—the Psalmist, I\nsay, having proposed such examples as these, infers from them that what\nare accounted fortuitous accidents, are so many proofs of his heavenly\nprovidence, especially of his paternal clemency; and that hence the pious\nhave cause to rejoice, while the mouths of the impious and reprobate are\nstopped. But, since the majority of men, immersed in their errors, are\nblind amidst the greatest opportunities of seeing, he accounts it a rare\ninstance of singular wisdom discreetly to consider these works of God;(92)\nfrom the sight of which, some, who, in other instances, discover the\ngreatest acuteness, receive no benefit. And, notwithstanding all the\ndisplays of the glory of God, scarcely one man in a hundred, is really a\nspectator of it. His power and wisdom are equally conspicuous. His power\nis illustriously manifested, when the ferocity of the impious, universally\ndeemed insuperable, is quelled in an instant, their arrogance subdued,\ntheir strongest fortresses demolished, their weapons and armour broken in\npieces, their strength diminished, their machinations confounded, and they\nfall by their own exertions; when the audacity, which exalted itself above\nthe heavens, is thrown down to the centre of the earth; when, on the\ncontrary, “the poor are raised out of the dust, and the needy out of the\ndunghill;”(93) the oppressed and afflicted extricated from distressing\nextremities, and the desperate restored to a good hope; when the unarmed\nare victorious over those who are armed, the few over the many, the weak\nover the strong. But his wisdom is eminently displayed in ordering every\ndispensation at the best possible time, confounding the greatest worldly\nsagacity, “taking the wise in their own craftiness,”(94) and finally\ndisposing all things according to the dictates of the highest reason.\nIX. We see that there is no need of any long or laborious argumentation,\nto obtain and produce testimonies for illustrating and asserting the\nDivine Majesty; since, from the few which we have selected and cursorily\nmentioned, it appears that they are every where so evident and obvious, as\neasily to be distinguished by the eyes, and pointed out with the fingers.\nAnd here it must again be observed, that we are invited to a knowledge of\nGod; not such as, content with empty speculation, merely floats in the\nbrain, but such as will be solid and fruitful, if rightly received and\nrooted in our hearts. For the Lord is manifested by his perfections:\nperceiving the influence and enjoying the benefits of which, we must\nnecessarily be more acutely impressed with such a knowledge, than if we\nimagined a Deity of whose influence we had no perception. Whence we\nconclude this to be the right way, and the best method of seeking God; not\nwith presumptuous curiosity to attempt an examination of his essence,\nwhich is rather to be adored than too curiously investigated; but to\ncontemplate him in his works, in which he approaches and familiarizes,\nand, in some measure, communicates himself to us. To this the Apostle\nreferred, when he said, that he is not to be sought far off, since, by his\nattribute of omnipresence, he dwells in every one of us.(95) Therefore\nDavid, having before confessed his greatness ineffable, after he descends\nto the mention of his works, adds, that he will “declare this\ngreatness.”(96) Wherefore it becomes us also to apply ourselves to such an\ninvestigation of God, as may fill our understanding with admiration, and\npowerfully interest our feelings. And, as Augustine somewhere teaches,\nbeing incapable of comprehending him, and fainting, as it were, under his\nimmensity, we must take a view of his works, that we may be refreshed with\nhis goodness.(97)\nX. Now, such a knowledge ought not only to excite us to the worship of\nGod, but likewise to awaken and arouse us to the hope of a future life.\nFor when we consider, that the specimens given by the Lord, both of his\nclemency and of his severity, are only begun, and not completed, we\ncertainly should esteem these as preludes to greater things, of which the\nmanifestation and full exhibition are deferred to another life. When we\nsee that pious men are loaded with afflictions by the impious, harassed\nwith injuries, oppressed with calumnies, and vexed with contumelious and\nopprobrious treatment; that the wicked, on the contrary, flourish,\nprosper, obtain ease and dignity, and all with impunity,—we should\nimmediately conclude, that there is another life, to which is reserved the\nvengeance due to iniquity, and the reward of righteousness. Moreover, when\nwe observe the faithful frequently chastised by the Lord’s rod, we may\nconclude, with great certainty, that the impious shall not always escape\nhis vengeance. For that is a wise observation of Augustine—“If open\npunishment were now inflicted for every sin, it would be supposed that\nnothing would be reserved till the last judgment. Again, if God now did\nnot openly punish any sin, it would be presumed that there was no divine\nprovidence.”(98) It must therefore be confessed, that in each of the works\nof God, but more especially in the whole considered together, there is a\nbright exhibition of the divine perfections; by which the whole human race\nis invited and allured to the knowledge of God, and thence to true and\ncomplete felicity. But, though those perfections are most luminously\nportrayed around us, we only discover their principal tendency, their use,\nand the end of our contemplation of them, when we descend into our own\nselves, and consider by what means God displays in us his life, wisdom,\nand power, and exercises towards us his righteousness, goodness, and\nmercy. For, though David justly complains that unbelievers are fools,\nbecause they consider not the profound designs of God in the government of\nmankind,(99) yet there is much truth in what he says in another place—that\nthe wonders of Divine Wisdom in this respect exceed in number the hairs of\nour head.(100) But as this argument must be treated more at large in due\ncourse, I at present omit it.\nXI. But, notwithstanding the clear representations given by God in the\nmirror of his works, both of himself and of his everlasting dominion, such\nis our stupidity, that, always inattentive to these obvious testimonies,\nwe derive no advantage from them. For, with regard to the structure and\nvery beautiful organization of the world, how few of us are there, who,\nwhen lifting up their eyes to heaven, or looking round on the various\nregions of the earth, direct their minds to the remembrance of the\nCreator, and do not rather content themselves with a view of his works, to\nthe total neglect of their Author! And with respect to those things that\ndaily happen out of the ordinary course of nature, is it not the general\nopinion, that men are rolled and whirled about by the blind temerity of\nfortune, rather than governed by the providence of God? Or if, by the\nguidance and direction of these things, we are ever driven (as all men\nmust sometimes be) to the consideration of a God, yet, when we have rashly\nconceived an idea of some deity, we soon slide into our own carnal dreams,\nor depraved inventions, corrupting by our vanity the purity of divine\ntruth. We differ from one another, in that each individual imbibes some\npeculiarity of error; but we perfectly agree in a universal departure from\nthe one true God, to preposterous trifles. This disease affects, not only\nthe vulgar and ignorant, but the most eminent, and those who, in other\nthings, discover peculiar sagacity. How abundantly have all the\nphilosophers, in this respect, betrayed their stupidity and folly! For, to\nspare others, chargeable with greater absurdities, Plato himself, the most\nreligious and judicious of them all, loses himself in his round\nglobe.(101) And what would not befall others, when their principal men,\nwhose place it was to enlighten the rest, stumble upon such gross errors!\nSo also, while the government of human actions proves a providence too\nplainly to admit of a denial, men derive no more advantage from it, than\nif they believed all things to be agitated forwards and backwards by the\nuncertain caprice of fortune; so great is our propensity to vanity and\nerror! I speak exclusively of the excellent of mankind, not of the vulgar,\nwhose madness in the profanation of divine truth has known no bounds.\nXII. Hence that immense flood of errors, which has deluged the whole\nworld. For every man’s understanding is like a labyrinth to him; so that\nit is not to be wondered at, that the different nations were drawn aside\ninto various inventions, and even that almost every individual had his own\nparticular deity. For, amidst the union of temerity and wantonness with\nignorance and darkness, scarcely a man could be found who did not frame to\nhimself some idol or phantasm instead of God. Indeed, the immense\nmultitude of gods proceeding from the mind of man, resembles the\nebullition of waters from a vast and ample spring, while every one, with\nan extreme licentiousness of error, invents one thing or another\nconcerning God himself. It is not necessary here to compose a catalogue of\nthe superstitions which have perplexed the world; for it would be an\nendless task; and, without a word more being said, the horrible blindness\nof the human mind sufficiently appears from such a multiplicity of\ncorruptions. I pass over the rude and unlearned vulgar. But among the\nphilosophers,(102) who attempted with reason and learning to penetrate\nheaven, how shameful is the diversity! In proportion to the vigour of his\nnatural genius, and the polish acquired by art and science, each of them\nseemed to give the more specious colouring to his own opinion; but, on a\nclose inspection, you will find them all fading colours. The Stoics said,\nin their own opinion very shrewdly, that from all the parts of nature may\nbe collected various names of God, but yet that the one God is not\ntherefore divided;(103) as if we were not already too much inclined to\nvanity, without being further and more violently seduced into error, by\nthe notion of such a various abundance of gods. The mystical theology of\nthe Egyptians also shows that they all sedulously endeavoured to preserve\nthe appearance of reason in the midst of their folly.(104) And any thing\napparently probable might at first sight, perhaps, deceive the simple and\nincautious; but there never was any human invention by which religion was\nnot basely corrupted. And this confused diversity imboldened the\nEpicureans, and other gross despisers of piety, to reject all idea of God.\nFor, seeing the wisest of men contending with each other for contrary\nopinions, they hesitated not, from their dissensions, and from the\nfrivolous and absurd doctrines maintained by the different parties, to\ninfer, that it was vain and foolish for men to torment themselves with\ninvestigations concerning God, who does not exist. And this they thought\nthey might do with impunity, supposing that a compendious denial of any\nGod at all would be better than feigning uncertain gods, and thereby\noccasioning endless controversies. They reason very ignorantly, or rather\nendeavour to conceal their own impiety behind the ignorance of men, which\nnot at all justifies any encroachment on God. But from the general\nconfession, that there is no subject productive of so many dissensions\namong the learned as well as the unlearned, it is inferred, that the minds\nof men, which err so much in investigations concerning God, are extremely\nblind and stupid in celestial mysteries. Others commend the answer of\nSimonides,(105) who, being asked by Hiero the Tyrant what God was,\nrequested a day to consider it. When the tyrant, the next day, repeated\nthe inquiry, he begged to be allowed two days longer; and, having often\ndoubled the number of days, at length answered, “The longer I consider the\nsubject, the more obscure it appears to me.” He prudently suspended his\nopinion on a subject so obscure to him; yet this shows that men, who are\ntaught only by nature, have no certain, sound, or distinct knowledge, but\nare confined to confused principles; so that they worship an unknown God.\nXIII. Now, it must also be maintained, that whoever adulterates the pure\nreligion, (which must necessarily be the case of all who are influenced by\ntheir own imagination,) he is guilty of a departure from the one God. They\nwill profess, indeed, a different intention; but what they intend, or what\nthey persuade themselves, is of little importance; since the Holy Spirit\npronounces all to be apostates, who, in the darkness of their minds,\nsubstitute demons in the place of God. For this reason Paul declares the\nEphesians to have been “without God”(106)—till they had learned from the\ngospel the worship of the true God. Nor should this be restricted to one\nnation only, since, in another place, he asserts of men in general, that\nthey “became vain in their imaginations,”(107) after the majesty of the\nCreator had been discovered to them in the structure of the world. And\ntherefore the Scripture, to make room for the only true God, condemns, as\nfalse and lying, whatever was formerly worshipped as divine among the\nGentiles,(108) and leaves no Deity but in Mount Sion, where flourished the\npeculiar knowledge of God. Indeed, among the Gentiles, the Samaritans, in\nthe days of Christ, seemed to approach very nearly to true piety; yet we\nhear, from the mouth of Christ, that they “worshipped they knew not\nwhat;”(109) whence it follows, that they were under a vain and erroneous\ndelusion. In fine, though they were not all the subjects of gross vices,\nor open idolaters, there was no pure and approved religion, their notions\nbeing founded only in common sense. For, though there were a few\nuninfected with the madness of the vulgar, this assertion of Paul remains\nunshaken, that “none of the princes of this world knew the wisdom of\nGod.”(110) But if the most exalted have been involved in the darkness of\nerror, what must be said of the dregs of the people! Wherefore it is not\nsurprising if the Holy Spirit reject, as spurious, every form of worship\nwhich is of human contrivance; because, in the mysteries of heaven, an\nopinion acquired by human means, though it may not always produce an\nimmense mass of errors, yet always produces some. And though no worse\nconsequence follow, it is no trivial fault to worship, at an uncertainty,\nan unknown god; of which, however, Christ pronounces all to be guilty who\nhave not been taught by the law what god they ought to worship. And indeed\nthe best legislators have proceeded no further than to declare religion to\nbe founded upon common consent. And even Socrates, in Xenophon,(111)\npraises the answer of Apollo, which directed that every man should worship\nthe gods according to the rites of his country, and the custom of his own\ncity. But whence had mortals this right of determining, by their own\nauthority, what far exceeds all the world? or who could so acquiesce in\nthe decrees of the rulers or the ordinances of the people, as without\nhesitation to receive a god delivered to him by the authority of man?\nEvery man will rather abide by his own judgment, than be subject to the\nwill of another. Since, then, the following of the custom of a city, or\nthe consent of antiquity, in divine worship, is too weak and frail a bond\nof piety, it remains for God himself to give a revelation concerning\nhimself from heaven.\nXIV. Vain, therefore, is the light afforded us in the formation of the\nworld to illustrate the glory of its Author; which, though its rays be\ndiffused all around us, is insufficient to conduct us into the right way.\nSome sparks, indeed, are kindled, but smothered before they have emitted\nany great degree of light. Wherefore the Apostle, in the place before\ncited, says, “By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the\nword of God;”(112) thus intimating, that the invisible Deity was\nrepresented by such visible objects, yet that we have no eyes to discern\nhim, unless they be illuminated through faith by an internal revelation of\nGod. Nor does Paul, where he observes, that “that which may be known of\nGod is manifest”(113) in the creation of the world, design such a\nmanifestation as human sagacity may comprehend; but rather shows, that its\nutmost extent is to render men inexcusable. The same writer also, though\nin one place(114) he denies that God is to be traced far off, seeing he\ndwells within us, yet teaches, in another place,(115) the consequences of\nsuch a proximity. God, says he, “in times past suffered all nations to\nwalk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness,\nin that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,\nfilling our hearts with food and gladness.”(116) Though the Lord, then, is\nnot destitute of a testimony concerning himself, while with various and\nmost abundant benignity he sweetly allures mankind to a knowledge of him,\nyet they persist in following their own ways, their pernicious and fatal\nerrors.\nXV. But whatever deficiency of natural ability prevents us from attaining\nthe pure and clear knowledge of God, yet, since that deficiency arises\nfrom our own fault, we are left without any excuse. Nor indeed can we set\nup any pretence of ignorance, that will prevent our own consciences from\nperpetually accusing us of indolence and ingratitude. Truly it would be a\ndefence worthy to be admitted, if a man should plead that he wanted ears\nto hear the truth, for the publication of which even the mute creatures\nare supplied with most melodious voices; if he should allege that his eyes\nare not capable of seeing what is demonstrated by the creatures without\nthe help of the eyes; if he should plead mental imbecility, while all the\nirrational creatures instruct us. Wherefore we are justly excluded from\nall excuse for our uncertain and extravagant deviations, since all things\nconspire to show us the right way. But, however men are chargeable with\nsinfully corrupting the seeds of divine knowledge, which, by the wonderful\noperation of nature, are sown in their hearts, so that they produce no\ngood and fair crop, yet it is beyond a doubt, that the simple testimony\nmagnificently borne by the creatures to the glory of God, is very\ninsufficient for our instruction. For as soon as a survey of the world has\njust shown us a deity, neglecting the true God, we set up in his stead the\ndreams and phantasms of our own brains; and confer on them the praise of\nrighteousness, wisdom, goodness, and power, due to him. We either obscure\nhis daily acts, or pervert them by an erroneous estimate; thereby\ndepriving the acts themselves of their glory, and their Author of his\ndeserved praise."

          "title": "Chapter VI. The Guidance And Teaching Of The Scripture Necessary To Lead",
          "content": "To The Knowledge Of God The Creator.\nThough the light which presents itself to all eyes, both in heaven and in\nearth, is more than sufficient to deprive the ingratitude of men of every\nexcuse, since God, in order to involve all mankind in the same guilt, sets\nbefore them all, without exception, an exhibition of his majesty,\ndelineated in the creatures,—yet we need another and better assistance,\nproperly to direct us to the Creator of the world. Therefore he hath not\nunnecessarily added the light of his word, to make himself known unto\nsalvation, and hath honoured with this privilege those whom he intended to\nunite in a more close and familiar connection with himself. For, seeing\nthe minds of all men to be agitated with unstable dispositions, when he\nhad chosen the Jews as his peculiar flock, he enclosed them as in a fold,\nthat they might not wander after the vanities of other nations. And it is\nnot without cause that he preserves us in the pure knowledge of himself by\nthe same means; for, otherwise, they who seem comparatively to stand firm,\nwould soon fall. For, as persons who are old, or whose eyes are by any\nmeans become dim, if you show them the most beautiful book, though they\nperceive something written, but can scarcely read two words together, yet,\nby the assistance of spectacles, will begin to read distinctly,—so the\nScripture, collecting in our minds the otherwise confused notions of\nDeity, dispels the darkness, and gives us a clear view of the true God.\nThis, then, is a singular favour, that, in the instruction of the Church,\nGod not only uses mute teachers, but even opens his own sacred mouth; not\nonly proclaims that some god ought to be worshipped, but at the same time\npronounces himself to be the Being to whom this worship is due; and not\nonly teaches the elect to raise their view to a Deity, but also exhibits\nhimself as the object of their contemplation. This method he hath observed\ntoward his Church from the beginning; beside those common lessons of\ninstruction, to afford them also his word; which furnishes a more correct\nand certain criterion to distinguish him from all fictitious deities. And\nit was undoubtedly by this assistance that Adam, Noah, Abraham, and the\nrest of the patriarchs, attained to that familiar knowledge which\ndistinguished them from unbelievers. I speak not yet of the peculiar\ndoctrine of faith which illuminated them into the hope of eternal life.\nFor, to pass from death to life, they must have known God, not only as the\nCreator, but also as the Redeemer; as they certainly obtained both from\nhis word. For that species of knowledge, which related to him as the\nCreator and Governor of the world, in order, preceded the other. To this\nwas afterwards added the other internal knowledge, which alone vivifies\ndead souls, and apprehends God, not only as the Creator of the world, and\nas the sole Author and Arbiter of all events, but also as the Redeemer in\nthe person of the Mediator. But, being not yet come to the fall of man and\nthe corruption of nature, I also forbear to treat of the remedy. Let the\nreader remember, therefore, that I am not yet treating of that covenant by\nwhich God adopted the children of Abraham, and of that point of doctrine\nby which believers have always been particularly separated from the\nprofane nations, since that is founded on Christ; but am only showing how\nwe ought to learn from the Scripture, that God, who created the world, may\nbe certainly distinguished from the whole multitude of fictitious deities.\nThe series of subjects will, in due time, lead us to redemption. But,\nthough we shall adduce many testimonies from the New Testament, and some\nalso from the Law and the Prophets, in which Christ is expressly\nmentioned, yet they will all tend to prove, that the Scripture discovers\nGod to us as the Creator of the world, and declares what sentiments we\nshould form of him, that we may not be seeking after a deity in a\nlabyrinth of uncertainty.\nII. But, whether God revealed himself to the patriarchs by oracles and\nvisions, or suggested, by means of the ministry of men, what should be\nhanded down by tradition to their posterity, it is beyond a doubt that\ntheir minds were impressed with a firm assurance of the doctrine, so that\nthey were persuaded and convinced that the information they had received\ncame from God. For God always secured to his word an undoubted credit,\nsuperior to all human opinion. At length, that the truth might remain in\nthe world in a continual course of instruction to all ages, he determined\nthat the same oracles which he had deposited with the patriarchs should be\ncommitted to public records. With this design the Law was promulgated, to\nwhich the Prophets were afterwards annexed, as its interpreters.—For,\nthough the uses of the law were many, as will be better seen in the proper\nplace; and particularly the intention of Moses, and of all the prophets,\nwas to teach the mode of reconciliation between God and man, (whence also\nPaul calls Christ “the end of the law,”)(117)—yet I repeat again, that,\nbeside the peculiar doctrine of faith and repentance, which proposes\nChrist as the Mediator, the Scripture distinguishes the only true God by\ncertain characters and titles, as the Creator and Governor of the world,\nthat he may not be confounded with the multitude of false gods. Therefore,\nthough every man should seriously apply himself to a consideration of the\nworks of God, being placed in this very splendid theatre to be a spectator\nof them, yet he ought principally to attend to the word, that he may\nattain superior advantages. And, therefore, it is not surprising, that\nthey who are born in darkness grow more and more hardened in their\nstupidity; since very few attend to the word of God with teachable\ndispositions, to restrain themselves within the limits which it\nprescribes, but rather exult in their own vanity. This, then, must be\nconsidered as a fixed principle, that, in order to enjoy the light of true\nreligion, we ought to begin with the doctrine of heaven; and that no man\ncan have the least knowledge of true and sound doctrine, without having\nbeen a disciple of the Scripture. Hence originates all true wisdom, when\nwe embrace with reverence the testimony which God hath been pleased\ntherein to deliver concerning himself. For obedience is the source, not\nonly of an absolutely perfect and complete faith, but of all right\nknowledge of God. And truly in this instance God hath, in his providence,\nparticularly consulted the true interests of mankind in all ages.\nIII. For, if we consider the mutability of the human mind,—how easy its\nlapse into forgetfulness of God; how great its propensity to errors of\nevery kind; how violent its rage for the perpetual fabrication of new and\nfalse religions,—it will be easy to perceive the necessity of the heavenly\ndoctrine being thus committed to writing, that it might not be lost in\noblivion, or evaporate in error, or be corrupted by the presumption of\nmen. Since it is evident, therefore, that God, foreseeing the inefficacy\nof his manifestation of himself in the exquisite structure of the world,\nhath afforded the assistance of his word to all those to whom he\ndetermined to make his instructions effectual,—if we seriously aspire to a\nsincere contemplation of God, it is necessary for us to pursue this right\nway. We must come, I say, to the word, which contains a just and lively\ndescription of God as he appears in his works, when those works are\nestimated, not according to our depraved judgment, but by the rule of\neternal truth. If we deviate from it, as I have just observed, though we\nrun with the utmost celerity, yet, being out of the course, we shall never\nreach the goal. For it must be concluded, that the light of the Divine\ncountenance, which even the Apostle says “no man can approach unto,”(118)\nis like an inexplicable labyrinth to us, unless we are directed by the\nline of the word; so that it were better to halt in this way, than to run\nwith the greatest rapidity out of it. Therefore David, inculcating the\nnecessity of the removal of superstitions out of the world, that pure\nreligion may flourish, frequently introduces God as “reigning;”(119) by\nthe word “reigning,” intending, not the power which he possesses, and\nwhich he exercises in the universal government of nature, but the doctrine\nin which he asserts his legitimate sovereignty; because errors can never\nbe eradicated from the human heart, till the true knowledge of God is\nimplanted in it.\nIV. Therefore the same Psalmist, having said, that “the heavens declare\nthe glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handy‐work; day unto day\nuttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge,”(120) afterwards\nproceeds to the mention of the word: “The law of the Lord is perfect,\nconverting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the\nsimple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the\ncommandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.” For, though he\nalso comprehends other uses of the law, yet he suggests, in general, that,\nsince God’s invitation of all nations to him by the view of heaven and\nearth is ineffectual, this is the peculiar school of the children of God.\nThe same is adverted to in the twenty‐ninth Psalm, where the Psalmist,\nhaving preached the terrors of the Divine voice, which in thunders, in\nwinds, in showers, in whirlwinds, and in tempests, shakes the earth, makes\nthe mountains tremble, and breaks the cedars, adds, at length, towards the\nclose, “in his temple doth every one speak of his glory;” because\nunbelievers are deaf to all the voices of God, which resound in the air.\nSo, in another Psalm, after describing the terrible waves of the sea, he\nconcludes thus: “Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine\nhouse, O Lord, for ever.”(121) Hence also proceeds the observation of\nChrist to the Samaritan woman, that her nation and all others worshipped\nthey knew not what; and that the Jews were the only worshippers of the\ntrue God.(122) For, since the human mind is unable, through its\nimbecility, to attain any knowledge of God without the assistance of his\nsacred word, all mankind, except the Jews, as they sought God without the\nword, must necessarily have been wandering in vanity and error."

          "content": "Scripture, In Order To The Complete Establishment Of Its Authority. The\nSuspension Of Its Authority On The Judgment Of The Church, An Impious\nFiction.\nBefore I proceed any further, it is proper to introduce some remarks on\nthe authority of the Scripture, not only to prepare the mind to regard it\nwith due reverence, but also to remove every doubt. For, when it is\nadmitted to be a declaration of the word of God, no man can be so\ndeplorably presumptuous, unless he be also destitute of common sense and\nof the common feelings of men, as to dare to derogate from the credit due\nto the speaker. But since we are not favoured with daily oracles from\nheaven, and since it is only in the Scriptures that the Lord hath been\npleased to preserve his truth in perpetual remembrance, it obtains the\nsame complete credit and authority with believers, when they are satisfied\nof its divine origin, as if they heard the very words pronounced by God\nhimself. The subject, indeed, merits a diffuse discussion, and a most\naccurate examination. But the reader will pardon me, if I attend rather to\nwhat the design of this work admits, than to what the extensive nature of\nthe present subject requires. But there has very generally prevailed a\nmost pernicious error, that the Scriptures have only so much weight as is\nconceded to them by the suffrages of the Church; as though the eternal and\ninviolable truth of God depended on the arbitrary will of men. For thus,\nwith great contempt of the Holy Spirit, they inquire, Who can assure us\nthat God is the author of them? Who can with certainty affirm, that they\nhave been preserved safe and uncorrupted to the present age? Who can\npersuade us that this book ought to be received with reverence, and that\nexpunged from the sacred number, unless all these things were regulated by\nthe decisions of the Church? It depends, therefore, (say they,) on the\ndetermination of the Church, to decide both what reverence is due to the\nScripture, and what books are to be comprised in its canon. Thus\nsacrilegious men, while they wish to introduce an unlimited tyranny, under\nthe name of the Church, are totally unconcerned with what absurdities they\nembarrass themselves and others, provided they can extort from the\nignorant this one admission, that the Church can do every thing. But, if\nthis be true, what will be the condition of those wretched consciences,\nwhich are seeking a solid assurance of eternal life, if all the promises\nextant concerning it rest only on the judgment of men? Will the reception\nof such an answer cause their fluctuations to subside, and their terrors\nto vanish? Again, how will the impious ridicule our faith, and all men\ncall it in question, if it be understood to possess only a precarious\nauthority depending on the favour of men!\nII. But such cavillers are completely refuted even by one word of the\nApostle. He testifies that the church is “built upon the foundation of the\napostles and prophets.”(123) If the doctrine of the prophets and apostles\nbe the foundation of the Church, it must have been certain, antecedently\nto the existence of the Church. Nor is there any foundation for this\ncavil, that though the Church derive its origin from the Scriptures, yet\nit remains doubtful what writings are to be ascribed to the prophets and\napostles, unless it be determined by the Church. For if the Christian\nChurch has been from the beginning founded on the writings of the prophets\nand the preaching of the apostles, wherever that doctrine is found, the\napprobation of it has certainly preceded the formation of the Church;\nsince without it the Church itself had never existed. It is a very false\nnotion, therefore, that the power of judging of the Scripture belongs to\nthe Church, so as to make the certainty of it dependent on the Church’s\nwill. Wherefore, when the Church receives it, and seals it with her\nsuffrage, she does not authenticate a thing otherwise dubious or\ncontrovertible; but, knowing it to be the truth of her God, performs a\nduty of piety, by treating it with immediate veneration. But, with regard\nto the question, How shall we be persuaded of its divine original, unless\nwe have recourse to the decree of the Church? this is just as if any one\nshould inquire, How shall we learn to distinguish light from darkness,\nwhite from black, sweet from bitter? For the Scripture exhibits as clear\nevidence of its truth, as white and black things do of their colour, or\nsweet and bitter things of their taste.\nIII. I know, indeed, that they commonly cite the opinion of Augustine,\nwhere he says, “that he would not believe the Gospel unless he were\ninfluenced by the authority of the Church.”(124) But how falsely and\nunfairly this is cited in support of such a notion, it is easy to discover\nfrom the context. He was in that contending with the Manichees, who wished\nto be credited, without any controversy, when they affirmed the truth to\nbe on their side, but never proved it. Now, as they made the authority of\nthe Gospel a pretext in order to establish the credit of their Manichæus,\nhe inquires what they would do if they met with a man who did not believe\nthe Gospel; with what kind of persuasion they would convert him to their\nopinion. He afterwards adds, “Indeed, I would not give credit to the\nGospel,” &c., intending, that he himself, when an alien from the faith,\ncould not be prevailed on to embrace the Gospel as the certain truth of\nGod, till he was convinced by the authority of the Church. And is it\nsurprising that any one, yet destitute of the knowledge of Christ, should\npay a respect to men? Augustine, therefore, does not there maintain that\nthe faith of the pious is founded on the authority of the Church, nor does\nhe mean that the certainty of the Gospel depends on it; but simply, that\nunbelievers would have no assurance of the truth of the Gospel, that would\nwin them to Christ, unless they were influenced by the consent of the\nChurch. And a little before, he clearly confirms it in these words: “When\nI shall have commended my own creed, and derided yours, what judgment,\nthink you, ought we to form, what conduct ought we to pursue, but to\nforsake those who invite us to acknowledge things that are certain, and\nafterwards command us to believe things that are uncertain; and to follow\nthose who invite us first to believe what we cannot yet clearly see, that,\nbeing strengthened by faith, we may acquire an understanding of what we\nbelieve; our mind being now internally strengthened and illuminated, not\nby men, but by God himself?” These are the express words of Augustine;\nwhence the inference is obvious to every one, that this holy man did not\ndesign to suspend our faith in the Scriptures on the arbitrary decision of\nthe Church, but only to show (what we all confess to be true) that they\nwho are yet unilluminated by the Spirit of God, are, by a reverence for\nthe Church, brought to such a docility as to submit to learn the faith of\nChrist from the Gospel; and that thus the authority of the Church is an\nintroduction to prepare us for the faith of the Gospel. For we see that he\nwill have the certainty of the pious to rest on a very different\nfoundation. Otherwise I do not deny his frequently urging on the Manichees\nthe universal consent of the Church, with a view to prove the truth of the\nScripture, which they rejected. Whence his rebuke of Faustus, “for not\nsubmitting to the truth of the Gospel, so founded, so established, so\ngloriously celebrated, and delivered through certain successions from the\napostolic age.” But he nowhere insinuates that the authority which we\nattribute to the Scripture depends on the definitions or decrees of men:\nhe only produces the universal judgment of the Church, which was very\nuseful to his argument, and gave him an advantage over his adversaries. If\nany one desire a fuller proof of this, let him read his treatise “Of the\nAdvantage of Believing;” where he will find, that he recommends no other\nfacility of believing, than such as may afford us an introduction, and be\na proper beginning of inquiry, as he expresses himself; yet that we should\nnot be satisfied with mere opinion, but rest upon certain and solid truth.\nIV. It must be maintained, as I have before asserted, that we are not\nestablished in the belief of the doctrine till we are indubitably\npersuaded that God is its Author. The principal proof, therefore, of the\nScriptures is every where derived from the character of the Divine\nSpeaker. The prophets and apostles boast not of their own genius, or any\nof those talents which conciliate the faith of the hearers; nor do they\ninsist on arguments from reason; but bring forward the sacred name of God,\nto compel the submission of the whole world. We must now see how it\nappears, not from probable supposition, but from clear demonstration, that\nthis use of the divine name is neither rash nor fallacious. Now, if we\nwish to consult the true interest of our consciences; that they may not be\nunstable and wavering, the subjects of perpetual doubt; that they may not\nhesitate at the smallest scruples,—this persuasion must be sought from a\nhigher source than human reasons, or judgments, or conjectures—even from\nthe secret testimony of the Spirit. It is true that, if we were inclined\nto argue the point, many things might be adduced which certainly evince,\nif there be any God in heaven, that he is the Author of the Law, and the\nProphecies, and the Gospel. Even though men of learning and deep judgment\nrise up in opposition, and exert and display all the powers of their minds\nin this dispute, yet, unless they are wholly lost to all sense of shame,\nthis confession will be extorted from them, that the Scripture exhibits\nthe plainest evidences that it is God who speaks in it, which manifests\nits doctrine to be divine. And we shall soon see, that all the books of\nthe sacred Scripture very far excel all other writings. If we read it with\npure eyes and sound minds, we shall immediately perceive the majesty of\nGod, which will subdue our audacious contradictions, and compel us to obey\nhim. Yet it is acting a preposterous part, to endeavour to produce sound\nfaith in the Scripture by disputations. Though, indeed, I am far from\nexcelling in peculiar dexterity or eloquence, yet, if I were to contend\nwith the most subtle despisers of God, who are ambitious to display their\nwit and their skill in weakening the authority of Scripture, I trust I\nshould be able, without difficulty, to silence their obstreperous clamour.\nAnd, if it were of any use to attempt a refutation of their cavils, I\nwould easily demolish the boasts which they mutter in secret corners. But\nthough any one vindicates the sacred word of God from the aspersions of\nmen, yet this will not fix in their hearts that assurance which is\nessential to true piety. Religion appearing, to profane men, to consist\nwholly in opinion, in order that they may not believe any thing on foolish\nor slight grounds, they wish and expect it to be proved by rational\narguments, that Moses and the prophets spake by divine inspiration. But I\nreply, that the testimony of the Spirit is superior to all reason. For, as\nGod alone is a sufficient witness of himself in his own word, so also the\nword will never gain credit in the hearts of men, till it be confirmed by\nthe internal testimony of the Spirit. It is necessary, therefore, that the\nsame Spirit, who spake by the mouths of the prophets, should penetrate\ninto our hearts, to convince us that they faithfully delivered the oracles\nwhich were divinely intrusted to them. And this connection is very\nsuitably expressed in these words: “My Spirit that is upon thee, and my\nword which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor\nout of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, for\never.”(125) Some good men are troubled that they are not always prepared\nwith clear proof to oppose the impious, when they murmur with impunity\nagainst the divine word; as though the Spirit were not therefore\ndenominated a “seal,” and “an earnest,” for the confirmation of the faith\nof the pious; because, till he illuminate their minds, they are\nperpetually fluctuating amidst a multitude of doubts.\nV. Let it be considered, then, as an undeniable truth, that they who have\nbeen inwardly taught by the Spirit, feel an entire acquiescence in the\nScripture, and that it is self‐authenticated, carrying with it its own\nevidence, and ought not to be made the subject of demonstration and\narguments from reason; but it obtains the credit which it deserves with us\nby the testimony of the Spirit. For though it conciliate our reverence by\nits internal majesty, it never seriously affects us till it is confirmed\nby the Spirit in our hearts. Therefore, being illuminated by him, we now\nbelieve the divine original of the Scripture, not from our own judgment or\nthat of others, but we esteem the certainty, that we have received it from\nGod’s own mouth by the ministry of men, to be superior to that of any\nhuman judgment, and equal to that of an intuitive perception of God\nhimself in it. We seek not arguments or probabilities to support our\njudgment, but submit our judgments and understandings as to a thing\nconcerning which it is impossible for us to judge; and that not like some\npersons, who are in the habit of hastily embracing what they do not\nunderstand, which displeases them as soon as they examine it, but because\nwe feel the firmest conviction that we hold an invincible truth; nor like\nthose unhappy men who surrender their minds captives to superstitions, but\nbecause we perceive in it the undoubted energies of the Divine power, by\nwhich we are attracted and inflamed to an understanding and voluntary\nobedience, but with a vigour and efficacy superior to the power of any\nhuman will or knowledge. With the greatest justice, therefore, God\nexclaims by Isaiah,(126) that the prophets and all the people were his\nwitnesses; because, being taught by prophecies, they were certain that God\nhad spoken without the least fallacy or ambiguity. It is such a\npersuasion, therefore, as requires no reasons; such a knowledge as is\nsupported by the highest reason, in which, indeed, the mind rests with\ngreater security and constancy than in any reasons; it is, finally, such a\nsentiment as cannot be produced but by a revelation from heaven. I speak\nof nothing but what every believer experiences in his heart, except that\nmy language falls far short of a just explication of the subject. I pass\nover many things at present, because this subject will present itself for\ndiscussion again in another place. Only let it be known here, that that\nalone is true faith which the Spirit of God seals in our hearts. And with\nthis one reason every reader of modesty and docility will be satisfied:\nIsaiah predicts that “all the children” of the renovated Church “shall be\ntaught of God.”(127) Herein God deigns to confer a singular privilege on\nhis elect, whom he distinguishes from the rest of mankind. For what is the\nbeginning of true learning but a prompt alacrity to hear the voice of God?\nBy the mouth of Moses he demands our attention in these terms: “Say not in\nthine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? or, Who shall descend into the\ndeep? The word is even in thy mouth.”(128) If God hath determined that\nthis treasury of wisdom shall be reserved for his children, it is neither\nsurprising nor absurd, that we see so much ignorance and stupidity among\nthe vulgar herd of mankind. By this appellation I designate even those of\nthe greatest talents and highest rank, till they are incorporated into the\nChurch. Moreover, Isaiah, observing that the prophetical doctrine would be\nincredible, not only to aliens, but also to the Jews, who wished to be\nesteemed members of the family, adds, at the same time, the reason—Because\nthe arm of the Lord will not be revealed to all.(129) Whenever, therefore,\nwe are disturbed at the paucity of believers, let us, on the other hand,\nremember that none, but those to whom it was given, have any apprehension\nof the mysteries of God."

          "title": "Chapter VIII. Rational Proofs To Establish The Belief Of The Scripture.",
          "content": "Without this certainty, better and stronger than any human judgment, in\nvain will the authority of the Scripture be either defended by arguments,\nor established by the consent of the Church, or confirmed by any other\nsupports; since, unless the foundation be laid, it remains in perpetual\nsuspense. Whilst, on the contrary, when, regarding it in a different point\nof view from common things, we have once religiously received it in a\nmanner worthy of its excellence, we shall then derive great assistance\nfrom things which before were not sufficient to establish the certainty of\nit in our minds. For it is admirable to observe how much it conduces to\nour confirmation, attentively to study the order and disposition of the\nDivine Wisdom dispensed in it, the heavenly nature of its doctrine, which\nnever savours of any thing terrestrial, the beautiful agreement of all the\nparts with each other, and other similar characters adapted to conciliate\nrespect to any writings. But our hearts are more strongly confirmed, when\nwe reflect that we are constrained to admire it more by the dignity of the\nsubjects than by the beauties of the language. For even this did not\nhappen without the particular providence of God, that the sublime\nmysteries of the kingdom of heaven should be communicated, for the most\npart, in a humble and contemptible style; lest, if they had been\nillustrated with more of the splendour of eloquence, the impious might\ncavil that their triumph is only the triumph of eloquence. Now, since that\nuncultivated and almost rude simplicity procures itself more reverence\nthan all the graces of rhetoric, what opinion can we form, but that the\nforce of truth in the sacred Scripture is too powerful to need the\nassistance of verbal art? Justly, therefore, does the apostle argue that\nthe faith of the Corinthians was founded, “not in the wisdom of men, but\nin the power of God,” because his preaching among them was, “not with\nenticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of\npower.”(130) For the truth is vindicated from every doubt, when,\nunassisted by foreign aid, it is sufficient for its own support. But that\nthis is the peculiar property of the Scripture, appears from the\ninsufficiency of any human compositions, however artificially polished, to\nmake an equal impression on our minds. Read Demosthenes or Cicero; read\nPlato, Aristotle, or any others of that class; I grant that you will be\nattracted, delighted, moved, and enraptured by them in a surprising\nmanner; but if, after reading them, you turn to the perusal of the sacred\nvolume, whether you are willing or unwilling, it will affect you so\npowerfully, it will so penetrate your heart, and impress itself so\nstrongly on your mind, that, compared with its energetic influence, the\nbeauties of rhetoricians and philosophers will almost entirely disappear;\nso that it is easy to perceive something divine in the sacred Scriptures,\nwhich far surpasses the highest attainments and ornaments of human\nindustry.\nII. I grant, indeed, that the diction of some of the prophets is neat and\nelegant, and even splendid; so that they are not inferior in eloquence to\nthe heathen writers. And by such examples the Holy Spirit hath been\npleased to show, that he was not deficient in eloquence, though elsewhere\nhe hath used a rude and homely style. But whether we read David, Isaiah,\nand others that resemble them, who have a sweet and pleasant flow of\nwords, or Amos the herdsman, Jeremiah, and Zechariah, whose rougher\nlanguage savours of rusticity,—that majesty of the Spirit, which I have\nmentioned, is every where conspicuous. I am not ignorant that Satan in\nmany things imitates God, in order that, by the fallacious resemblance, he\nmay more easily insinuate himself into the minds of the simple; and has\ntherefore craftily disseminated, in unpolished and even barbarous\nlanguage, the most impious errors, by which multitudes have been miserably\ndeceived, and has often used obsolete forms of speech as a mask to conceal\nhis impostures. But the vanity and fraud of such affectation are visible\nto all men of moderate understanding. With respect to the sacred\nScripture, though presumptuous men try to cavil at various passages, yet\nit is evidently replete with sentences which are beyond the powers of\nhuman conception. Let all the prophets be examined; not one will be found,\nwho has not far surpassed the ability of men; so that those to whom their\ndoctrine is insipid must be accounted utterly destitute of all true taste.\nIII. This argument has been copiously treated by other writers; wherefore\nit may suffice at present merely to hint at a few things which chiefly\nrelate to the subject in a general view. Beside what I have already\ntreated on, the antiquity of the Scripture is of no small weight. For,\nnotwithstanding the fabulous accounts of the Greek writers concerning the\nEgyptian theology, yet there remains no monument of any religion, but what\nis much lower than the age of Moses. Nor does Moses invent a new deity; he\nonly makes a declaration of what the Israelites had, through a long series\nof years, received by tradition from their forefathers concerning the\neternal God. For what does he aim at, but to recall them to the covenant\nmade with Abraham? If he had advanced a thing till then unheard of, it\nwould not have been received; but their liberation from the servitude in\nwhich they were detained must have been a thing well known to them all; so\nthat the mention of it immediately excited universal attention. It is\nprobable also that they had been informed of the number of four hundred\nyears. Now, we must consider, if Moses (who himself preceded all other\nwriters by such a long distance of time) derives the tradition of his\ndoctrine from so remote a beginning, how much the sacred Scripture exceeds\nin antiquity all other books.\nIV. Unless any would choose to credit the Egyptians, who extend their\nantiquity to six thousand years before the creation of the world. But\nsince their garrulity has been ridiculed even by all the profane writers,\nI need not trouble myself with refuting it. Josephus, in his book against\nAppion, cites from the most ancient writers testimonies worthy of being\nremembered; whence we may gather, that the doctrine contained in the law\nhas, according to the consent of all nations, been renowned from the\nremotest ages, although it was neither read nor truly understood. Now,\nthat the malicious might have no room for suspicion, nor even the wicked\nany pretence for cavilling, God hath provided the most excellent remedies\nfor both these dangers. When Moses relates what Jacob had, almost three\nhundred years before, by the spirit of inspiration pronounced concerning\nhis posterity, how does he disgrace his own tribe! He even brands it, in\nthe person of Levi, with perpetual infamy. “Simeon,” says he, “and Levi,\ninstruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O my soul, come not thou\ninto their secret: unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou\nunited.”(131) He certainly might have been silent on that disgraceful\ncircumstance, not only to spare his father, but also to avoid aspersing\nhimself, as well as all his family, with part of the same ignominy. How\ncan any suspicion be entertained of him, who, voluntarily publishing, from\nthe inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the first of the family from\nwhich he was descended was guilty of detestable conduct, neither consults\nhis own personal honours, nor refuses to incur the resentment of his\nrelations, to whom this must undoubtedly have given offence? When he\nmentions also the impious murmurings of Aaron, his brother, and Miriam,\nhis sister,(132) shall we say that he spake according to the dictates of\nthe flesh, or obeyed the command of the Holy Spirit? Besides, as he\nenjoyed the supreme authority, why did he not leave to his own sons, at\nleast, the office of the high‐priesthood, but place them in the lowest\nstation? I only hint at a few things out of many. But in the law itself\nmany arguments will every where occur, which challenge a full belief,\nthat, without controversy, the legation of Moses was truly divine.\nV. Moreover, the miracles which he relates, and which are so numerous and\nremarkable, are so many confirmations of the law which he delivered, and\nof the doctrine which he published. For that he was carried up into the\nmountain in a cloud; that he continued there forty days, deprived of all\nhuman intercourse; that, in the act of proclaiming the law, his face shone\nas with the rays of the sun; that lightnings flashed all around; that\nthunders and various noises were heard through the whole atmosphere; that\na trumpet sounded, but a trumpet not blown by human breath; that the\nentrance of the tabernacle was concealed from the view of the people by an\nintervening cloud; that his authority was so miraculously vindicated by\nthe horrible destruction of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and all their\nimpious faction; that a rock smitten with a rod immediately emitted a\nriver; that manna rained from heaven at his request;(133)—are not all\nthese so many testimonies from heaven of his being a true prophet? If any\none object that I assume, as granted, things which are the subjects of\ncontroversy, this cavil is easily answered. For, as Moses published all\nthese things in an assembly of the people, what room was there for fiction\namong those who had been eye‐witnesses of the events? Is it probable that\nhe would make his appearance in public, and, accusing the people of\ninfidelity, contumacy, ingratitude, and other crimes, boast that his\ndoctrine had been confirmed in their sight by miracles which they had\nnever seen?\nVI. For this also is worthy of being remarked, that all his accounts of\nmiracles are connected with such unpleasant circumstances, as were\ncalculated to stimulate all the people, if there had been but the smallest\noccasion, to a public and positive contradiction; whence it appears, that\nthey were induced to coincide with him only by the ample conviction of\ntheir own experience. But since the matter was too evident for profane\nwriters to take the liberty of denying the performance of miracles by\nMoses, the father of lies has suggested the calumny of ascribing them to\nmagical arts. But by what kind of conjecture can they pretend to charge\nhim with having been a magician, who had so great an abhorrence of that\nsuperstition, as to command, that he who merely consulted magicians and\nsoothsayers should be stoned?(134) Certainly no impostor practises such\njuggling tricks, who does not make it his study, for the sake of acquiring\nfame, to astonish the minds of the vulgar. But what is the practice of\nMoses? Openly avowing that himself and his brother Aaron are nothing,(135)\nbut that they only execute the commands of God, he sufficiently clears his\ncharacter from every unfavourable aspersion. Now, if the events themselves\nbe considered, what incantation could cause manna to rain daily from\nheaven sufficient to support the people, and, if any one laid up more than\nthe proper quantity, cause it to putrefy, as a punishment from God for his\nunbelief? Add also the many serious examinations which God permitted his\nservant to undergo, so that the clamour of the wicked can now be of no\navail. For as often as this holy servant of God was in danger of being\ndestroyed, at one time by proud and petulant insurrections of all the\npeople, at another by the secret conspiracies of a few,—how was it\npossible for him to elude their inveterate rage by any arts of deception?\nAnd the event evidently proves, that by these circumstances his doctrine\nwas confirmed to all succeeding ages.\nVII. Moreover, who can deny that his assigning, in the person of the\npatriarch Jacob, the supreme power to the tribe of Judah, proceeded from a\nspirit of prophecy,(136) especially if we consider the eventual\naccomplishment of this prediction? Suppose Moses to have been the first\nauthor of it; yet after he committed it to writing, there elapsed four\nhundred years in which we have no mention of the sceptre in the tribe of\nJudah. After the inauguration of Saul, the regal power seemed to be fixed\nin the tribe of Benjamin. When Samuel anointed David, what reason appeared\nfor transferring it? Who would have expected a king to arise out of the\nplebeian family of a herdsman? And of seven brothers, who would have\nconjectured that such an honour was destined for the youngest? And by what\nmeans did he attain a hope of the kingdom? Who can assert that this\nunction was directed by human art, or industry, or prudence, and was not\nrather a completion of the prediction of heaven? And in like manner do not\nhis predictions, although obscure, concerning the admission of the\nGentiles into the covenant of God, which were accomplished almost two\nthousand years after, clearly prove him to have spoken under a divine\ninspiration? I omit other predictions, which so strongly savour of a\ndivine inspiration, that all who have the use of their reason must\nperceive that it is God who speaks. In short, one song of his is a clear\nmirror in which God evidently appears.(137)\nVIII. But in the other prophets this is yet far more conspicuous. I shall\nonly select a few examples; for to collect all would be too laborious.\nWhen, in the time of Isaiah, the kingdom of Judah was in peace, and even\nwhen they thought themselves safe in the alliance of the Chaldeans, Isaiah\npublicly spake of the destruction of the city and the banishment of the\npeople.(138) Now, even if to predict long before things which then seemed\nfalse, but have since appeared to be true, were not a sufficiently clear\nproof of a divine inspiration, to whom but God shall we ascribe the\nprophecies which he uttered concerning their deliverance? He mentions the\nname of Cyrus, by whom the Chaldeans were to be subdued, and the people\nrestored to liberty.(139) More than a century elapsed after this prophecy\nbefore the birth of Cyrus; for he was not born till about the hundredth\nyear after the prophet’s death. No man could then divine, that there would\nbe one Cyrus, who would engage in a war with the Babylonians, who would\nsubjugate such a powerful monarchy, and release the people of Israel from\nexile. Does not this bare narration, without any ornaments of diction,\nplainly demonstrate that Isaiah delivered the undoubted oracles of God,\nand not the conjectures of men? Again, when Jeremiah, just before the\npeople were carried away, limited the duration of their captivity to\nseventy years, and predicted their liberation and return, must not his\ntongue have been under the direction of the Spirit of God?(140) What\nimpudence must it be to deny that the authority of the prophets has been\nconfirmed by such proofs, or that what they themselves assert, in order to\nvindicate the credit due to their declarations, has been actually\nfulfilled! “Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do\nI declare: before they spring forth, I tell you of them.”(141) I shall not\nspeak of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who, living in distant countries, but\nprophesying at the same time, so exactly accord in their declarations, as\nthough they had mutually dictated the words to each other. What shall we\nsay of Daniel? Has not he prophesied of the events of nearly six hundred\nyears in such a connected series, as if he were composing a history of\ntransactions already past and universally known? If pious men properly\nconsider these things, they will be sufficiently prepared to curb the\npetulance of the wicked; for the demonstration is too clear to be liable\nto any cavils.\nIX. I know what is objected by some clamorous men, who would\nostentatiously display the force of their understanding in opposing divine\ntruth. For they inquire, Who has assured us that Moses and the prophets\nactually wrote those books which bear their names? They even dare to\nquestion whether such a man as Moses ever existed. But if any man should\ncall in question the existence of Plato, or Aristotle, or Cicero, who\nwould deny that such madness ought to receive corporal punishment? The law\nof Moses has been wonderfully preserved, rather by the providence of\nheaven than by the endeavours of men. And though, through the negligence\nof the priests, it lay for a short time concealed, since it was found by\nthe pious king Josiah, it has continued in the hands of men through every\nsucceeding age.(142) Nor, indeed, did Josiah produce it as a thing unknown\nor new, but as what had always been public, and the memory of which was\nthen famous. The protograph had been appointed to be kept in the temple,\nand a transcript of it to be deposited in the royal archives;(143) only\nthe priests had discontinued their ancient custom of publishing the law,\nand the people themselves had neglected their wonted reading of it: yet\nthere scarcely passed an age in which its sanction was not confirmed and\nrenewed. Were they, who had the writings of David, ignorant of Moses? But,\nto speak of all at once, it is certain, that their writings descended to\nposterity only from hand to hand, (so to speak,) through a long series of\nyears transmitted from the fathers, who partly had heard them speak, and\npartly learned from others who heard them, while it was fresh in their\nmemory, that they had thus spoken.\nX. With regard to what they object from the history of the Maccabees, to\ndiminish the credit of the Scripture, nothing could be conceived more\nadapted to establish it. But first let us divest it of their artificial\ncolouring, and then retort upon them the weapon which they direct against\nus. When Antiochus, say they, commanded all the books to be burned, whence\nproceeded the copies which we now have? I, on the contrary, inquire, where\nthey could so speedily be fabricated. For it is evident, that, as soon as\nthe persecution subsided, they immediately appeared, and were, without\ncontroversy, acknowledged as the same by all pious men; who, having been\neducated in their doctrine, had been familiarly acquainted with them. Nay,\neven when all the impious, as if by a general conspiracy, so wantonly\ninsulted the Jews, no man ever dared to charge them with forging their\nbooks. For, whatever be their opinion of the Jewish religion, yet they\nconfess that Moses was the author of it. What, then, do these clamorous\nobjectors, but betray their own consummate impudence, when they slander,\nas supposititious, books whose sacred antiquity is confirmed by the\nconsent of all histories? But, to waste no more useless labour in refuting\nsuch stale calumnies, let us rather consider how carefully the Lord\npreserved his own word, when, beyond all hope, he rescued it from the fury\nof the most cruel of tyrants, as from a devouring fire;—that he endued the\npious priests and others with so much constancy, that they hesitated not\nto redeem this treasure, if necessary, with their lives, to transmit it to\nposterity; and that he frustrated the most diligent inquisition of so many\ngovernors and soldiers. Who is there but must acknowledge it to have been\nan eminent and wonderful work of God, that those sacred monuments, which\nthe impious had flattered themselves were utterly destroyed, were soon\npublic again, as it were, fully restored to mankind, and, indeed, with far\ngreater honour? For soon after followed the Greek Translation, which\npublished them throughout the world. Nor was God’s preserving the tables\nof his covenant from the sanguinary edicts of Antiochus, the only instance\nof his wonderful operation, but that, amidst such various miseries, with\nwhich the Jewish nation was diminished and laid waste, and at last nearly\nexterminated, these records still remained entire. The Hebrew language lay\nnot only despised, but almost unknown; and surely, had not God consulted\nthe interest of religion, it had been totally lost. For how much the Jews,\nafter their return from captivity, departed from the genuine use of their\nnative language, appears from the prophets of that age; which it is\ntherefore useful to observe, because this comparison more clearly evinces\nthe antiquity of the law and the prophets. And by whom hath God preserved\nto us the doctrine of salvation contained in the law and the prophets,\nthat Christ might be manifested in due time? By his most inveterate\nenemies, the Jews; whom Augustine therefore justly denominates the\nlibrarians of the Christian Church, because they have furnished us with a\nbook of which themselves make no use.\nXI. If we proceed to the New Testament, by what solid foundations is its\ntruth supported? Three Evangelists recite their history in a low and mean\nstyle. Many proud men are disgusted with that simplicity, because they\nattend not to the principal points of doctrine; whence it were easy to\ninfer, that they treat of heavenly mysteries which are above human\ncapacity. They who have a spark of ingenuous modesty will certainly be\nashamed, if they peruse the first chapter of Luke. Now, the discourses of\nChrist, a concise summary of which is comprised in these three\nEvangelists, easily exempt their writings from contempt. But John,\nthundering from his sublimity, more powerfully than any thunderbolt,\nlevels to the dust the obstinacy of those whom he does not compel to the\nobedience of faith. Let all those censorious critics whose supreme\npleasure consists in banishing all reverence for the Scripture out of\ntheir own hearts and the hearts of others, come forth to public view. Let\nthem read the Gospel of John: whether they wish it or not, they will there\nfind numerous passages, which, at least, arouse their indolence; and which\nwill even imprint a horrible brand on their consciences to restrain their\nridicule. Similar is the method of Paul and of Peter, in whose writings,\nthough the greater part be blind, yet their heavenly majesty attracts\nuniversal attention. But this one circumstance raises their doctrine\nsufficiently above the world, that Matthew, who had before been confined\nto the profit of his table, and Peter and John, who had been employed in\nfishing‐boats,—all plain, unlettered men,—had learned nothing in any human\nschool which they could communicate to others. And Paul, from not only a\nprofessed, but a cruel and sanguinary enemy, being converted to a new man,\nproves, by his sudden and unhoped for change, that he was constrained, by\na command from heaven, to vindicate that doctrine which he had before\nopposed. Let these men deny that the Holy Spirit descended on the\nApostles; or, at least, let them dispute the credibility of the history;\nyet the fact itself loudly proclaims, that they were taught by the Spirit,\nwho, though before despised as some of the meanest of the people, suddenly\nbegan to discourse in such a magnificent manner on the mysteries of\nheaven.\nXII. Besides, there are also other very substantial reasons why the\nconsent of the Church should have its weight. For it is not an unimportant\nconsideration, that, since the publication of the Scripture, so many\ngenerations of men should have agreed in voluntarily obeying it; and that\nhowever Satan, together with the whole world, has endeavoured by strange\nmethods to suppress or destroy it, or utterly to erase and obliterate it\nfrom the memory of man, yet it has always, like a palm‐tree, risen\nsuperior to all opposition, and remained invincible. Indeed, there has\nscarcely ever been a sophist or orator of more than common abilities, who\nhas not tried his strength in opposing it; yet they have all availed\nnothing. All the powers of the earth have armed themselves for its\ndestruction; but their attempts have all evaporated into smoke. How could\nit have so firmly resisted attacks on every quarter, if it had been\nsupported only by human power? Indeed, an additional proof of its Divine\norigin arises from this very circumstance, that, notwithstanding all the\nstrenuous resistance of men, it has, by its own power, risen superior to\nevery danger. Moreover, not one city, or one nation, only, has conspired\nto receive and embrace it; but, as far as the world extends, it has\nobtained its authority by the holy consent of various nations, who agreed\nin nothing besides. And as such an agreement of minds, so widely distant\nin place, and so completely dissimilar in manners and opinions, ought to\nhave great influence with us, since it is plain that it was effected only\nby the power of heaven, so it acquires no small weight from a\nconsideration of the piety of those who unite in this agreement; not\nindeed of all, but of those, who, it hath pleased the Lord, should shine\nas luminaries in his Church.\nXIII. Now, with what unlimited confidence should we submit to that\ndoctrine, which we see confirmed and witnessed by the blood of so many\nsaints! Having once received it, they hesitated not, with intrepid\nboldness, and even with great alacrity, to die in its defence: transmitted\nto us with such a pledge, how should we not receive it with a firm and\nunshaken conviction? Is it therefore no small confirmation of the\nScripture, that it has been sealed with the blood of so many martyrs?\nespecially when we consider that they died to bear testimony to their\nfaith, not through intemperate fanaticism, as is sometimes the case with\nmen of erroneous minds, but through a firm and constant, yet sober zeal\nfor God. There are other reasons, and those neither few nor weak, by which\nthe native dignity and authority of the Scripture are not only maintained\nin the minds of the pious, but also completely vindicated against the\nsubtleties of calumniators; but such as alone are not sufficient to\nproduce firm faith in it, till the heavenly Father, discovering his own\npower therein, places its authority beyond all controversy. Wherefore the\nScripture will then only be effectual to produce the saving knowledge of\nGod, when the certainty of it shall be founded on the internal persuasion\nof the Holy Spirit. Thus those human testimonies, which contribute to its\nconfirmation, will not be useless, if they follow that first and principal\nproof, as secondary aids to our imbecility. But those persons betray great\nfolly, who wish it to be demonstrated to infidels that the Scripture is\nthe word of God, which cannot be known without faith. Augustine therefore\njustly observes,(144) that piety and peace of mind ought to precede, in\norder that a man may understand somewhat of such great subjects."

          "content": "Pretence Of Resorting To Immediate Revelations, Subversive Of Every\nPrinciple Of Piety.\nPersons who, abandoning the Scripture, imagine to themselves some other\nway of approaching to God, must be considered as not so much misled by\nerror as actuated by frenzy. For there have lately arisen some unsteady\nmen, who, haughtily pretending to be taught by the Spirit, reject all\nreading themselves, and deride the simplicity of those who still attend to\n(what they style) the dead and killing letter. But I would ask them, what\nspirit that is, by whose inspiration they are elevated to such a\nsublimity, as to dare to despise the doctrine of the Scripture, as puerile\nand mean. For, if they answer that it is the Spirit of Christ, how\nridiculous is such an assurance! for that the apostles of Christ, and\nother believers in the primitive Church, were illuminated by no other\nSpirit, I think they will concede. But not one of them learned, from his\nteaching, to contemn the Divine word; they were rather filled with higher\nreverence for it, as their writings abundantly testify. This had been\npredicted by the mouth of Isaiah. For where he says, “My Spirit that is\nupon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart\nout of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, for ever,”(145) he\ndoes not confine people under the old dispensation to the external letter,\nas though they were children learning to read, but declares, that it will\nbe the true and complete felicity of the new Church, under the reign of\nChrist, to be governed by the word of God, as well as by his Spirit.\nWhence we infer, that these persons are guilty of detestable sacrilege, in\ndisjoining these two things, which the prophet has connected in an\ninviolable union. Again; Paul, after he had been caught up into the third\nheaven, did not cease to study the doctrine of the law and the prophets;\nas he also exhorted Timothy, a teacher of more than common excellence, to\n“give attendance to reading.”(146) And worthy of remembrance is his\neulogium on the Scripture, that it “is profitable for doctrine, for\nreproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of\nGod may be perfect.”(147) How diabolical, then, is that madness which\npretends that the use of the Scripture is only transient and temporary,\nwhich guides the sons of God to the highest point of perfection! I would\nalso ask them another question—whether they have imbibed a different\nspirit from that which the Lord promised to his disciples? Great as their\ninfatuation is, I do not think them fanatical enough to hazard such an\navowal. But what kind of Spirit did he promise? One, truly, who should\n“not speak of himself,”(148) but suggest and instil into their minds those\nthings which he had orally delivered. The office of the Spirit, then,\nwhich is promised to us, is not to feign new and unheard of revelations,\nor to coin a new system of doctrine, which would seduce us from the\nreceived doctrine of the Gospel, but to seal to our minds the same\ndoctrine which the Gospel delivers.\nII. Hence we readily understand that it is incumbent on us diligently to\nread and attend to the Scripture, if we would receive any advantage or\nsatisfaction from the Spirit of God; (thus also Peter(149) commends those\nwho studiously attended to the doctrine of the prophets, which yet might\nbe supposed to have retired after the light of the Gospel was risen;) but,\non the contrary, that if any spirit, neglecting the wisdom of the word of\nGod, obtrude on us another doctrine, he ought justly to be suspected of\nvanity and falsehood. For, as Satan transforms himself into an angel of\nlight, what authority will the Spirit have with us, unless we can\ndistinguish him by the most certain criterion? We find him clearly\ndesignated, indeed, in the word of the Lord; but these unhappy men are\nfondly bent on delusion, even to their own destruction, seeking a spirit\nrather from themselves than from him. But they plead, that it is unworthy\nof the Spirit of God, to whom all things ought to be subject, to be made\nsubject to the Scripture; as though it were ignominious to the Holy Spirit\nto be every where equal and uniform, in all things invariably consistent\nwith himself. If he were to be conformed to the rules of men, or of\nangels, or of any other beings, I grant he might then be considered as\ndegraded, or even reduced to a state of servitude; but while he is\ncompared with himself, and considered in himself, who will assert that he\nis thereby injured? This is bringing him to the test of examination. I\nconfess it is. But it is the way which he has chosen for the confirmation\nof his majesty among us. We ought to be satisfied, as soon as he\ncommunicates himself to us. But, lest the spirit of Satan should insinuate\nhimself under his name, he chooses to be recognized by us from his image,\nwhich he hath impressed in the Scriptures. He is the author of the\nScriptures: he cannot be mutable and inconsistent with himself. He must\ntherefore perpetually remain such as he has there discovered himself to\nbe. This is not disgraceful to him; unless we esteem it honourable for him\nto alter and degenerate from himself.\nIII. But their cavilling objection, that we depend on “the letter that\nkilleth,” shows, that they have not escaped the punishment due to the\ndespisers of the Scripture. For it is sufficiently evident, that Paul is\nthere contending against the false apostles,(150) who, recommending the\nlaw to the exclusion of Christ, were seducing the people from the\nblessings of the New Covenant, in which the Lord engages to engrave his\nlaw in the minds of believers, and to inscribe it on their hearts. The\nletter therefore is dead, and the law of the Lord slays the readers of it,\nwhere it is separated from the grace of Christ, and only sounds in the\nears, without affecting the heart. But if it be efficaciously impressed on\nour hearts by the Spirit,—if it exhibit Christ,—it is the word of life,\n“converting the soul, making wise the simple,” &c.(151) But in the same\nplace the Apostle also calls his preaching “the ministration of the\nSpirit;”(152) doubtless intending, that the Holy Spirit so adheres to his\nown truth, which he hath expressed in the Scriptures, that he only\ndisplays and exerts his power where the word is received with due\nreverence and honour. Nor is this repugnant to what I before asserted,\nthat the word itself has not much certainty with us, unless when confirmed\nby the testimony of the Spirit. For the Lord hath established a kind of\nmutual connection between the certainty of his word and of his Spirit; so\nthat our minds are filled with a solid reverence for the word, when by the\nlight of the Spirit we are enabled therein to behold the Divine\ncountenance; and, on the other hand, without the least fear of mistake, we\ngladly receive the Spirit, when we recognize him in his image, that is, in\nthe word. This is the true state of the case. God did not publish his word\nto mankind for the sake of momentary ostentation, with a design to destroy\nor annul it immediately on the advent of the Spirit; but he afterwards\nsent the same Spirit, by whose agency he had dispensed his word, to\ncomplete his work by an efficacious confirmation of that word. In this\nmanner Christ opened the understanding of his two disciples;(153) not\nthat, rejecting the Scriptures, they might be wise enough of themselves,\nbut that they might understand the Scriptures. So when Paul exhorts the\nThessalonians to “quench not the Spirit,”(154) he does not lead them to\nempty speculations independent of the word; for he immediately adds,\n“despise not prophesyings;” clearly intimating, that the light of the\nSpirit is extinguished when prophecies fall into contempt. What answer can\nbe given to these things, by those proud fanatics, who think themselves\npossessed of the only valuable illumination, when, securely neglecting and\nforsaking the Divine word, they, with equal confidence and temerity,\ngreedily embrace every reverie which their distempered imaginations may\nhave conceived? A very different sobriety becomes the children of God;\nwho, while they are sensible that, exclusively of the Spirit of God, they\nare utterly destitute of the light of truth, yet are not ignorant that the\nword is the instrument, by which the Lord dispenses to believers the\nillumination of his Spirit. For they know no other Spirit than that who\ndwelt in and spake by the apostles; by whose oracles they are continually\ncalled to the hearing of the word."

          "content": "Exclusive Opposition Of The True God To All The Fictitious Deities Of The\nHeathen.\nBut, since we have shown that the knowledge of God, which is otherwise\nexhibited without obscurity in the structure of the world, and in all the\ncreatures, is yet more familiarly and clearly unfolded in the word, it\nwill be useful to examine, whether the representation, which the Lord\ngives us of himself in the Scripture, agrees with the portraiture which he\nhad before been pleased to delineate in his works. This is indeed an\nextensive subject, if we intended to dwell on a particular discussion of\nit. But I shall content myself with suggesting some hints, by which the\nminds of the pious may learn what ought to be their principal objects of\ninvestigation in Scripture concerning God, and may be directed to a\ncertain end in that inquiry. I do not yet allude to the peculiar covenant\nwhich distinguished the descendants of Abraham from the rest of the\nnations. For in receiving, by gratuitous adoption, those who were his\nenemies into the number of his children, God even then manifested himself\nas a Redeemer; but we are still treating of that knowledge which relates\nto the creation of the world, without ascending to Christ the Mediator.\nBut though it will be useful soon to cite some passages from the New\nTestament, (since that also demonstrates the power of God in the creation,\nand his providence in the conservation of the world,) yet I wish the\nreader to be apprized of the point now intended to be discussed, that he\nmay not pass the limits which the subject prescribes. At present, then,\nlet it suffice to understand how God, the former of heaven and earth,\ngoverns the world which he hath made. Both his paternal goodness, and the\nbeneficent inclinations of his will, are every where celebrated; and\nexamples are given of his severity, which discover him to be the righteous\npunisher of iniquities, especially where his forbearance produces no\nsalutary effects upon the obstinate.\nII. In some places, indeed, we are favoured with more explicit\ndescriptions, which exhibit to our view an exact representation of his\ngenuine countenance. For Moses, in the description which he gives of it,\ncertainly appears to have intended a brief comprehension of all that it\nwas possible for men to know concerning him—“The Lord, the Lord God,\nmerciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,\nkeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and\nsin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of\nthe fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children.”(155)\nWhere we may observe, first, the assertion of his eternity and self‐\nexistence, in that magnificent name, which is twice repeated; and\nsecondly, the celebration of his attributes, giving us a description, not\nof what he is in himself, but of what he is to us, that our knowledge of\nhim may consist rather in a lively perception, than in vain and airy\nspeculation. Here we find an enumeration of the same perfections which, as\nwe have remarked, are illustriously displayed both in heaven and on\nearth—clemency, goodness, mercy, justice, judgment, and truth. For power\nis comprised in the word Elohim, God. The prophets distinguish him by the\nsame epithets, when they intend a complete exhibition of his holy name.\nBut, to avoid the necessity of quoting many passages, let us content\nourselves at present with referring to one Psalm;(156) which contains such\nan accurate summary of all his perfections, that nothing seems to be\nomitted. And yet it contains nothing but what may be known from a\ncontemplation of the creatures. Thus, by the teaching of experience, we\nperceive God to be just what he declares himself in his word. In Jeremiah,\nwhere he announces in what characters he will be known by us, he gives a\ndescription, not so full, but to the same effect—“Let him that glorieth\nglory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord,\nwhich exercise loving‐kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the\nearth.”(157) These three things it is certainly of the highest importance\nfor us to know—mercy, in which alone consists all our salvation; judgment,\nwhich is executed on the wicked every day, and awaits them in a still\nheavier degree to eternal destruction; righteousness, by which the\nfaithful are preserved, and most graciously supported. When you understand\nthese things, the prophecy declares that you have abundant reason for\nglorying in God. Nor is this representation chargeable with an omission of\nhis truth, or his power, or his holiness, or his goodness. For how could\nwe have that knowledge, which is here required, of his righteousness,\nmercy, and judgment, unless it were supported by his inflexible veracity?\nAnd how could we believe that he governed the world in judgment and\njustice, if we were ignorant of his power? And whence proceeds his mercy,\nbut from his goodness? If all his ways, then, are mercy, judgment, and\nrighteousness, holiness also must be conspicuously displayed in them.\nMoreover, the knowledge of God, which is afforded us in the Scriptures, is\ndesigned for the same end as that which we derive from the creatures: it\ninvites us first to the fear of God, and then to confidence in him; that\nwe may learn to honour him with perfect innocence of life, and sincere\nobedience to his will, and to place all our dependence on his goodness.\nIII. But here I intend to comprise a summary of the general doctrine. And,\nfirst, let the reader observe, that the Scripture, in order to direct us\nto the true God, expressly excludes and rejects all the gods of the\nheathen; because, in almost all ages, religion has been generally\ncorrupted. It is true, indeed, that the name of one supreme God has been\nuniversally known and celebrated. For those who used to worship a\nmultitude of deities, whenever they spake according to the genuine sense\nof nature, used simply the name of God, in the singular number, as though\nthey were contented with one God. And this was wisely remarked by Justin\nMartyr, who for this purpose wrote a book _On the Monarchy of God_, in\nwhich he demonstrates, from numerous testimonies, that the unity of God\nwas a principle universally impressed on the hearts of men. Tertullian\nalso proves the same point from the common phraseology.(158) But since all\nmen, without exception, have by their own vanity been drawn into erroneous\nnotions, and so their understandings have become vain, all their natural\nperception of the Divine unity has only served to render them inexcusable.\nFor even the wisest of them evidently betray the vagrant uncertainty of\ntheir minds, when they wish for some god to assist them, and in their vows\ncall upon unknown and fabulous deities. Besides, in imagining the\nexistence of many natures in God, though they did not entertain such\nabsurd notions as the ignorant vulgar concerning Jupiter, Mercury, Venus,\nMinerva, and the rest, they were themselves by no means exempt from the\ndelusions of Satan; and, as we have already remarked, whatever subterfuges\ntheir ingenuity has invented, none of the philosophers can exculpate\nthemselves from the crime of revolting from God by the corruption of his\ntruth. For this reason Habakkuk, after condemning all idols, bids us to\nseek “the Lord in his holy temple,”(159) that the faithful might\nacknowledge no other God than Jehovah, who had revealed himself in his\nword."

          "title": "Chapter XI. Unlawfulness Of Ascribing To God A Visible Form. All Idolatry",
          "content": "A Defection From The True God.\nNow, as the Scripture, in consideration of the ignorance and dulness of\nthe human understanding, generally speaks in the plainest manner,—where it\nintends to discriminate between the true God and all false gods, it\nprincipally contrasts him with idols; not that it may sanction the more\ningenious and plausible systems of the philosophers, but that it may\nbetter detect the folly and even madness of the world in researches\nconcerning God, as long as every one adheres to his own speculations. That\nexclusive definition, therefore, which every where occurs, reduces to\nnothing whatever notions of the Deity men may form in their own\nimaginations; since God alone is a sufficient witness concerning himself.\nIn the mean time, since the whole world has been seized with such brutal\nstupidity, as to be desirous of visible representations of the Deity, and\nthus to fabricate gods of wood, stone, gold, silver, and other inanimate\nand corruptible materials, we ought to hold this as a certain principle,\nthat, whenever any image is made as a representation of God, the Divine\nglory is corrupted by an impious falsehood. Therefore God, in the law,\nafter having asserted the glory of Deity to belong exclusively to himself,\nwhen he intends to show what worship he approves or rejects, immediately\nadds, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness.”\nIn these words he forbids us to attempt a representation of him in any\nvisible figure; and briefly enumerates all the forms by which superstition\nhad already begun to change his truth into a lie. For the Persians, we\nknow, worshipped the sun; and the foolish heathen made for themselves as\nmany gods as they saw stars in the heavens. There was scarcely an animal,\nindeed, which the Egyptians did not consider as an image of God. The\nGreeks appeared wiser than the rest, because they worshipped the Deity\nunder the human form.(160) But God compares not idols with each other, as\nthough one were better or worse than another; but rejects, without a\nsingle exception, all statues, pictures, and other figures, in which\nidolaters imagined that he would be near them.\nII. This it is easy to infer from the reasons which he annexes to the\nprohibition. First, in the writings of Moses: “Take ye therefore good heed\nunto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude, on the day that the\nLord spake unto you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the\nvoice of the words, but saw no similitude; lest ye corrupt yourselves, and\nmake you a graven image, the similitude of any figure,” &c.(161) We see\nhow expressly God opposes his “voice” to every “manner of similitude,” to\nshow, that whoever desires visible representations of him, is guilty of\ndeparting from him. It will be sufficient to refer to one of the Prophets,\nIsaiah,(162) who insists more than all the others on this argument, that\nthe Divine Majesty is dishonoured by mean and absurd fiction, when he that\nis incorporeal is likened to a corporeal form; he that is invisible, to a\nvisible image; he that is a spirit, to inanimate matter; and he that fills\nimmensity, to a log of wood, a small stone, or a lump of gold. Paul also\nreasons in the same manner: “Forasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of\nGod, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver,\nor stone, graven by art and man’s device.”(163) Whence it follows, that\nwhatever statues are erected, or images painted, to represent God, they\nare only displeasing to him, as being so many insults to the Divine\nMajesty. And why should we wonder at the Holy Spirit thundering forth such\noracles from heaven, since he compels the blind and wretched idolaters to\nmake a similar confession on earth? Well known is the complaint of Seneca,\nwhich is cited by Augustine: “They dedicate (says he) the vilest and\nmeanest materials to represent the sacred, immortal, and inviolable gods;\nand give them some a human form, and some a brutal one, and some a double\nsex, and different bodies; and they confer the name of gods upon images\nwhich, if animated, would be accounted monsters.” Hence it further appears\nthat the pretence set up by the advocates for idols, that they were\nforbidden to the Jews because they were prone to superstition, is only a\nfrivolous cavil, to evade the force of the argument. As if truly that were\npeculiarly applicable to one nation, which God deduces from his eternal\nexistence, and the invariable order of nature! Besides, Paul was not\naddressing the Jews, but the Athenians, when he refuted the error of\nmaking any similitude of God.\nIII. Sometimes indeed God hath discovered his presence by certain signs,\nso that he was said to be seen “face to face;”(164) but all the signs\nwhich he ever adopted, were well calculated for the instruction of men,\nand afforded clear intimations of his incomprehensible essence. For “the\ncloud, and the smoke, and the flame,”(165) though they were symbols of\ncelestial glory, nevertheless operated as a restraint on the minds of all,\nto prevent their attempting to penetrate any further. Wherefore even Moses\n(to whom he manifested himself more familiarly than to any other) obtained\nnot by his prayers a sight of the face of God, but received this answer:\n“Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see my face and\nlive.”(166) The Holy Spirit once appeared in the form of a dove;(167) but,\nas he presently disappeared again, who does not perceive that by this\nmomentary symbol the faithful are taught that they should believe the\nSpirit to be invisible? that, being content with his power and grace, they\nmight make no external representation of him. The appearances of God in\nthe human form were preludes to his future manifestation in Christ.\nTherefore the Jews were not permitted to make this a pretext for erecting\na symbol of Deity in the figure of a man. “The mercy seat”(168) also, from\nwhich, under the law, God displayed the presence of his power, was so\nconstructed, as to suggest that the best contemplation of the Divine Being\nis when the mind is transported beyond itself with admiration. For “the\ncherubim” covered it with their extended wings; the veil was spread before\nit; and the place itself was sufficiently concealed by its secluded\nsituation. It is manifestly unreasonable therefore to endeavour to defend\nimages of God and of the saints, by the example of those cherubim. For,\npray, what was signified by those little images but that images are not\ncalculated to represent the Divine mysteries? since they were formed in\nsuch a manner as, by veiling the mercy seat with their wings, to prevent\nnot only the eyes, but all the human senses, from prying into God, and so\nto restrain all temerity. Moreover, the Prophet describes the seraphim\nwhom he saw in a vision, as having “their faces covered;”(169) to signify,\nthat the splendour of the Divine glory is so great, that even the angels\nthemselves cannot steadfastly behold it; and the faint sparks of it, which\nshine in the angels, are concealed from our view. The cherubim, however,\nof which we are now speaking, are acknowledged by all persons of sound\njudgment to have been peculiar to the old state of tutelage under the\nlegal dispensation. To adduce them, therefore, as examples for the\nimitation of the present age, is quite absurd. For that puerile period, as\nI may call it, for which such rudiments were appointed, is now past. And,\nindeed, it is a shameful consideration, that heathen writers are more\nexpert interpreters of the Divine law than the papists. Juvenal reproaches\nand ridicules the Jews for worshipping the white clouds and Deity of\nheaven. This language, indeed, is perverse and impious; but in denying\nthat there was any image of God among them, he speaks with more truth than\nthe papists, who idly pretend that there was some visible figure of him.\nBut as that nation frequently broke out into idolatry, with great and\nsudden impetuosity, resembling the violent ebullition of water from a\nlarge spring, hence let us learn the strong propensity of the human mind\nto idolatry, lest, imputing to the Jews a crime common to all, we should\nbe fascinated by the allurements of sin, and sleep the sleep of death.\nIV. To the same purpose is that passage, “The idols of the heathen are\nsilver and gold, the work of men’s hands;”(170) for the Prophet concludes,\nfrom the very materials, that they are no gods, whose images are made of\ngold or of silver; and takes it for granted, that every conception we form\nof the Deity, merely from our own understandings, is a foolish\nimagination. He mentions gold and silver rather than clay or stone, that\nthe splendour or the value of the materials may procure no reverence for\nthe idols. But he concludes in general, that nothing is more improbable,\nthan that gods should be manufactured from any inanimate matter. At the\nsame time he insists equally on another point—that it is presumption and\nmadness in mortal men, who are every moment in danger of losing the\nfleeting breath which they draw, to dare to confer upon idols the honour\ndue to God. Man is constrained to confess that he is a creature of a day,\nand yet he will have a piece of metal to be worshipped as a god, of the\ndeity of which he is the author; for whence did idols originate, but in\nthe will of men? There is much propriety in that sarcasm of a heathen\npoet, who represents one of their idols as saying, “Formerly, I was the\ntrunk of a wild fig‐tree, a useless log; when the artificer, after\nhesitating whether he would make me a stool or a deity, at length\ndetermined that I should be a god.”(171)\nA poor mortal, forsooth, who is, as it were, expiring almost every moment,\nwill, by his workmanship, transfer to a dead stock the name and honour of\nGod. But as that Epicurean, in his satirical effusions, has paid no\nrespect to any religion,—leaving this sarcasm, and others of the same\nkind, we should be stung and penetrated by the rebuke which the\nProphet(172) has given to the extreme stupidity of those, who, with the\nsame wood, make a fire to warm themselves, heat an oven for baking bread,\nroast or boil their meat, and fabricate a god, before which they prostrate\nthemselves, to address their humble supplications. In another place,\ntherefore, he not only pronounces them transgressors of the law, but\nreproaches them for not having learned from the foundations of the\nearth;(173) since, in reality, there is nothing more unreasonable than the\nthought of contracting the infinite and incomprehensible God within the\ncompass of five feet. And yet this monstrous abomination, which is\nmanifestly repugnant to the order of nature, experience demonstrates to be\nnatural to man. It must be further observed, that idols are frequently\nstigmatized as being the works of men’s hands, unsanctioned by Divine\nauthority; in order to establish this principle, that all modes of worship\nwhich are merely of human invention, are detestable. The Psalmist\naggravates this madness, forasmuch as men implore the aid of dead and\ninsensible things, who are imbued with understanding to know that all\nthings are directed solely by the power of God. But since the corruption\nof nature carries all nations in general, and each individual in\nparticular, to such an excess of frenzy, the Spirit at length thunders out\nthis direful imprecation: “Let those that make them be like unto them and\nevery one that trusteth in them.”(174) Let it be observed, that all\nsimilitudes are equally as much forbidden as graven images; which refutes\nthe foolish subterfuge of the Greeks; for they think themselves quite\nsafe, if they make no sculpture of Deity, while in pictures they indulge\ngreater liberty than any other nations. But the Lord prohibits every\nrepresentation of him, whether made by the statuary, or by any other\nartificer, because all similitudes are criminal and insulting to the\nDivine Majesty.\nV. I know that it is a very common observation, that images are the books\nof the illiterate. Gregory said so; but very different is the decision of\nthe Spirit of God, in whose school had Gregory been taught, he would never\nhave made such an assertion. For, since Jeremiah pronounces that “the\nstock is a doctrine of vanities,”(175) since Habakkuk represents “a molten\nimage” as “a teacher of lies,”(176)—certainly the general doctrine to be\ngathered from these passages is, that whatever men learn respecting God\nfrom images is equally frivolous and false. If any one object, that the\nProphets only reprehended those who abuse images to the impious purposes\nof superstition,—that indeed I grant; but affirm also, what is evident to\nevery one, that they utterly condemn what is assumed by the papists as an\nindubitable axiom, that images are substitutes for books. For they\ncontrast images with the true God, as contraries, which can never agree.\nThis comparison, I say, is laid down in those passages which I have just\ncited; that, since there is only one true God, whom the Jews worshipped,\nthere can be no visible figures made, to serve as representations of the\nDivine Being, without falsehood and criminality; and all who seek the\nknowledge of God from such figures are under a miserable delusion. Were it\nnot true, that all knowledge of God, sought from images, is corrupt and\nfallacious, it would not be so uniformly condemned by the Prophets. This\nat least must be granted to us, that, when we maintain the vanity and\nfallaciousness of the attempts of men to make visible representations of\nGod, we do no other than recite the express declarations of the Prophets.\nVI. Read likewise what has been written on this subject by Lactantius and\nEusebius, who hesitate not to assume as a certainty, that all those whose\nimages are to be seen, were mortal men. Augustine also confidently asserts\nthe unlawfulness, not only of worshipping images, but even of erecting any\nwith reference to God. Nor does he advance any thing different from what\nhad, many years before, been decreed by the Elibertine council, the\nthirty‐sixth chapter of which is as follows: “It hath been decreed, that\nno pictures be had in the churches, and that what is worshipped or adored\nbe not painted on the walls.” But most remarkable is what Augustine\nelsewhere cites from Varro, and to the truth of which he subscribes—“That\nthey who first introduced images of the gods, removed fear and added\nerror.” If this had been a mere assertion of Varro alone, it might have\nperhaps but little authority; yet it should justly fill us with shame,\nthat a heathen, groping as it were in the dark, attained so much light as\nto perceive that corporeal representations were unworthy of the Divine\nMajesty, being calculated to diminish the fear of God, and to increase\nerror among mankind. The fact itself demonstrates this to have been spoken\nwith equal truth and wisdom; but Augustine, having borrowed it from Varro,\nadvances it as his own opinion. And first he observes that the most\nancient errors concerning God, in which men were involved, did not\noriginate from images, but were increased by them, as by the superaddition\nof new materials. He next explains that the fear of God is thereby\ndiminished, and even destroyed; since the foolish, ridiculous, and absurd\nfabrication of idols would easily bring his Divinity into contempt. Of the\ntruth of this second remark, I sincerely wish that we had not such proofs\nin our own experience. Whoever, therefore, desires to be rightly\ninstructed, he must learn from some other quarter than from images, what\nis to be known concerning God.\nVII. If the papists have any shame, let them no longer use this\nsubterfuge, that images are the books of the illiterate; which is so\nclearly refuted by numerous testimonies from Scripture. Yet, though I\nshould concede this point to them, it would avail them but little in\ndefence of their idols. What monsters they obtrude in the place of Deity\nis well known. But what they call the pictures or statues of their\nsaints—what are they but examples of the most abandoned luxury and\nobscenity? which if any one were desirous of imitating, he would deserve\ncorporal punishment. Even prostitutes in brothels are to be seen in more\nchaste and modest attire, than those images in their temples, which they\nwish to be accounted images of virgins. Nor do they clothe the martyrs in\nhabits at all more becoming. Let them adorn their idols, then, with some\nsmall degree of modesty, that the pretence of their being books of some\nholiness, if not less false, may be less impudent. But even then, we will\nreply, that this is not the method to be adopted in sacred places for the\ninstruction of the faithful, whom God will have taught a very different\ndoctrine from any that can be learned from such insignificant trifles. He\nhath commanded one common doctrine to be there proposed to all, in the\npreaching of his word, and in his sacred mysteries; to which they betray\ngreat inattention of mind, who are carried about by their eyes to the\ncontemplation of idols. Whom, then, do the papists call illiterate, whose\nignorance will suffer them to be taught only by images? Those, truly, whom\nthe Lord acknowledges as his disciples; whom he honours with the\nrevelation of his heavenly philosophy; whom he will have instructed in the\nhealthful mysteries of his kingdom. I confess, indeed, as things are now\ncircumstanced, that there are at present not a few who cannot bear to be\ndeprived of such books. But whence arises this stupidity, but from being\ndefrauded of that teaching which alone is adapted to their instruction? In\nfact, those who presided over the churches, resigned to idols the office\nof teaching, for no other reason but because they were themselves dumb.\nPaul testifies, that in the true preaching of this gospel, Christ is\n“evidently set forth,” and, as it were, “crucified before our eyes.”(177)\nTo what purpose, then, was the erection of so many crosses of wood and\nstone, silver and gold, every where in the temples, if it had been fully\nand faithfully inculcated, that Christ died that he might bear our curse\non the cross, expiate our sins by the sacrifice of his body, cleanse us by\nhis blood, and, in a word, reconcile us to God the Father? From this\nsimple declaration they might learn more than from a thousand crosses of\nwood or stone; for perhaps the avaricious fix their minds and their eyes\nmore tenaciously on the gold and silver crosses, than on any part of the\nDivine word.\nVIII. Respecting the origin of idols, the generally received opinion\nagrees with what is asserted in the book of Wisdom;(178) namely, that the\nfirst authors of them were persons who paid this honour to the dead, from\na superstitious reverence for their memory. I grant that this perverse\ncustom was very ancient, and deny not that it greatly contributed to\nincrease the rage of mankind after idolatry; nevertheless, I cannot\nconcede that it was the first cause of that evil. For it appears from\nMoses, that idols were in use long before the introduction of that\nostentatious consecration of the images of the dead, which is frequently\nmentioned by profane writers. When he relates that Rachel stole her\nfather’s idols,(179) he speaks as of a common corruption. Whence we may\ninfer, that the mind of man is, if I may be allowed the expression, a\nperpetual manufactory of idols. After the deluge, there was, as it were, a\nregeneration of the world; but not many years elapsed before men\nfabricated gods according to their own fancy. And it is probable, that\nwhile the holy patriarch was yet alive, his posterity were addicted to\nidolatry, so that, with the bitterest grief, he might, with his own eyes,\nbehold the earth which God had lately purged from its corruptions by such\na dreadful judgment, again polluted with idols. For Terah and Nachor,\nbefore the birth of Abraham, were worshippers of false gods, as is\nasserted by Joshua.(180) Since the posterity of Shem so speedily\ndegenerated, what opinion must we entertain of the descendants of Ham, who\nhad already been cursed in their father? The true state of the case is,\nthat the mind of man, being full of pride and temerity, dares to conceive\nof God according to its own standard; and, being sunk in stupidity, and\nimmersed in profound ignorance; imagines a vain and ridiculous phantom\ninstead of God. These evils are followed by another; men attempt to\nexpress in the work of their hands such a deity as they have imagined in\ntheir minds. The mind then begets the idol, and the hand brings it forth.\nThe example of the Israelites proves this to have been the origin of\nidolatry, namely, that men believe not God to be among them, unless he\nexhibit some external signs of his presence. “As for this Moses,” they\nsaid, “we wot not what is become of him; make us gods which shall go\nbefore us.”(181) They knew, indeed, that there was a God, whose power they\nhad experienced in so many miracles; but they had no confidence in his\nbeing present with them, unless they could see some corporeal symbol of\nhis countenance, as a testimony of their Divine Guide. They wished,\ntherefore, to understand, from the image going before them, that God was\nthe leader of their march. Daily experience teaches, that the flesh is\nnever satisfied, till it has obtained some image, resembling itself, in\nwhich it may be foolishly gratified, as an image of God. In almost all\nages, from the creation of the world, in obedience to this stupid\npropensity, men have erected visible representations, in which they\nbelieved God to be presented to their carnal eyes.\nIX. Such an invention is immediately attended with adoration; for when men\nsupposed that they saw God in images, they also worshipped him in them. At\nlength, both their eyes and their minds being wholly confined to them,\nthey began to grow more stupid, and to admire them, as though they\npossessed some inherent divinity. Now, it is plain that men did not rush\ninto the worship of images, till they had imbibed some very gross opinion\nrespecting them; not, indeed, that they believed them to be gods, but they\nimagined that something of Divinity resided in them. When you prostrate\nyourself, therefore, in adoration of an image, whether you suppose it to\nrepresent God or a creature, you are already fascinated with superstition.\nFor this reason the Lord hath prohibited, not only the erection of statues\nmade as representations of him, but also the consecration of any\ninscriptions or monuments to stand as objects of worship. For the same\nreason, also, another point is annexed to the precept in the law\nconcerning adoration. For as soon as men have made a visible figure of\nGod, they attach Divine power to it. Such is the stupidity of men, that\nthey confine God to any image which they make to represent him, and\ntherefore cannot but worship it. Nor is it of any importance, whether they\nworship simply the idol, or God in the idol; it is always idolatry, when\nDivine honours are paid to an idol, under any pretence whatsoever. And as\nGod will not be worshipped in a superstitious or idolatrous manner,\nwhatever is conferred on idols is taken from him. Let this be considered\nby those who seek such miserable pretexts for the defence of that\nexecrable idolatry, with which, for many ages, true religion has been\noverwhelmed and subverted. The images, they say, are not considered as\ngods. Neither were the Jews so thoughtless as not to remember, that it was\nGod by whose hand they had been conducted out of Egypt, before they made\nthe calf. But when Aaron said that those were the gods by whom they had\nbeen liberated from Egypt, they boldly assented;(182) signifying,\ndoubtless, that they would keep in remembrance, that God himself was their\ndeliverer, while they could see him going before them in the calf. Nor can\nwe believe the heathen to have been so stupid, as to conceive that God was\nno other than wood and stone. For they changed the images at pleasure, but\nalways retained in their minds the same gods; and there were many images\nfor one god; nor did they imagine to themselves gods in proportion to the\nmultitude of images: besides, they daily consecrated new images, but\nwithout supposing that they made new gods. Read the excuses, which,\nAugustine says,(183) were alleged by the idolaters of the age in which he\nlived. When they were charged with idolatry, the vulgar replied, that they\nworshipped, not the visible figure, but the Divinity that invisibly dwelt\nin it. But they, whose religion was, as he expresses himself, more\nrefined, said, that they worshipped neither the image, nor the spirit\nrepresented by it; but that in the corporeal figure they beheld a sign of\nthat which they ought to worship. What is to be inferred from this, but\nthat all idolaters, whether Jewish or Gentile, have been guided by the\nnotion which I have mentioned? Not content with a spiritual knowledge of\nGod, they thought that they should receive more clear and familiar\nimpressions of him by means of images. After they had once pleased\nthemselves with such a preposterous representation of God, they ceased not\nfrom being deluded with new fallacies, till they imagined that God\ndisplayed his power in images. Nevertheless, the Jews were persuaded that,\nunder such images, they worshipped the eternal God, the one true Lord of\nheaven and earth; and the heathen, that they worshipped their false gods,\nwhom they pretended to be inhabitants of heaven.\nX. Those who deny that this has been done in time past, and even within\nour own remembrance, assert an impudent falsehood. For why do they\nprostrate themselves before images? And when about to pray, why do they\nturn themselves towards them, as towards the ears of God? For it is true,\nas Augustine says,(184) “That no man prays or worships thus, looking on an\nimage, who is not impressed with an opinion that he shall be heard by it,\nand a hope that it will do for him as he desires.” Why is there so great a\ndifference between images of the same god, that one is passed by with\nlittle or no respect, and another is honoured in the most solemn manner?\nWhy do they fatigue themselves with votive pilgrimages, in going to see\nimages resembling those which they have at home? Why do they at this day\nfight, even to slaughter and destruction, in defence of them, as of their\ncountry and religion, so that they could part with the only true God more\neasily than with their idols? Yet I am not here enumerating the gross\nerrors of the vulgar, which are almost infinite, and occupy nearly the\nhearts of all; I only relate what they themselves allege, when they are\nmost anxious to exculpate themselves from idolatry. “We never,” say they,\n“call them our gods.” Nor did the Jews or heathen in ancient times call\nthem their gods; and yet the Prophets, in all their writings, were\nconstantly accusing them of fornication with wood and stone, only on\naccount of such things as are daily practised by those who wish to be\nthought Christians; that is, for worshipping God, by corporeal adoration\nbefore figures of wood or stone.\nXI. I am neither ignorant, nor desirous of concealing, that they evade the\ncharge by a more subtle distinction, which will soon be noticed more at\nlarge. They pretend that the reverence which they pay to images is\nειδωλοδουλεια, (service of images,) but deny that it is ειδωλολατρεια\n(worship of images.) For in this manner they express themselves, when they\nmaintain, that the reverence which they call _dulia_, may be given to\nstatues or pictures, without injury to God. They consider themselves,\ntherefore, liable to no blame, while they are only the servants of their\nidols, and not worshippers of them; as though worship were not rather\ninferior to service. And yet, while they seek to shelter themselves under\na Greek term, they contradict themselves in the most childish manner. For\nsince the Greek word λατρευειν signifies nothing else but to worship, what\nthey say is equivalent to a confession that they adore their images, but\nwithout adoration. Nor can they justly object, that I am trying to insnare\nthem with words: they betray their own ignorance in their endeavours to\nraise a mist before the eyes of the simple. But, however eloquent they may\nbe, they will never be able, by their rhetoric, to prove one and the same\nthing to be two different things. Let them point out, I say, a difference\nin fact, that they may be accounted different from ancient idolaters. For\nas an adulterer, or homicide, will not escape the imputation of guilt, by\ngiving his crime a new and arbitrary name, so it is absurd that these\npersons should be exculpated by the subtle invention of a name, if they\nreally differ in no respect from those idolaters whom they themselves are\nconstrained to condemn. But their case is so far from being different from\nthat of former idolaters, that the source of all the evil is a\npreposterous emulation, with which they have rivalled them by exercising\ntheir minds in contriving, and their hands in forming, visible symbols of\nthe Deity.\nXII. Nevertheless, I am not so scrupulous as to think that no images ought\never to be permitted. But since sculpture and painting are gifts of God, I\nwish for a pure and legitimate use of both; lest those things, which the\nLord hath conferred on us for his glory and our benefit, be not only\ncorrupted by preposterous abuse, but even perverted to our ruin. We think\nit unlawful to make any visible figure as a representation of God, because\nhe hath himself forbidden it, and it cannot be done without detracting, in\nsome measure, from his glory. Let it not be supposed that we are singular\nin this opinion; for that all sound writers have uniformly reprobated the\npractice, must be evident to persons conversant with their works. If,\nthen, it be not lawful to make any corporeal representation of God, much\nless will it be lawful to worship it for God, or to worship God in it. We\nconclude, therefore, that nothing should be painted and engraved but\nobjects visible to our eyes: the Divine Majesty, which is far above the\nreach of human sight, ought not to be corrupted by unseemly figures. The\nsubjects of those arts consist partly of histories and transactions,\npartly of images and corporeal forms, without reference to any\ntransactions. The former are of some use in information or recollection;\nthe latter, as far as I see, can furnish nothing but amusement. And yet it\nis evident, that almost all the images, which have hitherto been set up in\nthe churches, have been of this latter description. Hence it may be seen,\nthat they were placed there, not with judgment and discrimination, but\nfrom a foolish and inconsiderate passion for them. I say nothing here of\nthe impropriety and indecency conspicuous in most of them, and the wanton\nlicentiousness displayed in them by the painters and statuaries, at which\nI have before hinted: I only assert, that even if they were intrinsically\nfaultless, still they would be altogether unavailing for the purposes of\ninstruction.\nXIII. But, passing over that difference also, let us consider, as we\nproceed, whether it be expedient to have any images at all in Christian\ntemples, either descriptive of historical events, or representative of\nhuman forms. In the first place, if the authority of the ancient Church\nhave any influence with us, let us remember, that for about five hundred\nyears, while religion continued in a more prosperous state, and purer\ndoctrine prevailed, the Christian churches were generally without images.\nThey were then first introduced, therefore, to ornament the churches, when\nthe purity of the ministry had begun to degenerate. I will not dispute\nwhat was the reason which influenced the first authors of them; but if you\ncompare one age with another, you will see that they were much declined\nfrom the integrity of those who had no images. Who can suppose, that those\nholy fathers would have permitted the Church to remain so long destitute\nof what they judged useful and salutary for it? The fact was, that,\ninstead of omitting them through ignorance or negligence, they perceived\nthem to be of little or no use, but, on the contrary, pregnant with much\ndanger; and, therefore, intentionally and wisely rejected them. This is\nasserted in express terms by Augustine: “When they are fixed,” says he,\n“in those places in an honourable elevation, to attract the attention of\nthose who are praying and sacrificing, though they are destitute of sense\nand life, yet, by the very similitude of living members and senses, they\naffect weak minds, so that they appear to them to live and breathe,”\n&c.(185) And in another place: “For that representation of members leads,\nand, as it were, constrains, the mind, which animates a body, to suppose\nthat body to be endued with perception, which it sees to be very similar\nto its own,” &c. And a little after: “Idols have more influence to bow\ndown an unhappy soul, because they have a mouth, eyes, ears, and feet,\nthan to correct it, because they neither speak, nor see, nor hear, nor\nwalk.” This indeed appears to be the reason of John’s exhortation to “keep\nourselves,” not only from the worship of idols, but “from idols”\nthemselves. And we have found it too true, that, through the horrible\nfrenzy, which, almost to the total destruction of piety, hath heretofore\npossessed the world, as soon as images are set up in churches, there is,\nas it were, a standard of idolatry erected; for the folly of mankind\ncannot refrain from immediately falling into idolatrous worship. But, even\nif the danger were less, yet, when I consider the use for which temples\nwere designed, it appears to me extremely unworthy of their sanctity, to\nreceive any other images, than those natural and expressive ones, which\nthe Lord hath consecrated in his word; I mean Baptism, and the Supper of\nthe Lord, and the other ceremonies, with which our eyes ought to be more\nattentively engaged, and more sensibly affected, than to require any\nothers formed by human ingenuity. Behold the incomparable advantages of\nimages! the loss of which, if you believe the papists, nothing can\ncompensate.\nXIV. The remarks already made on this subject, I think, would be\nsufficient, if it were not necessary to take some notice of the Council of\nNice; not that very celebrated one, which was convened by Constantine the\nGreat, but that which was held about eight hundred years ago, by the\ncommand, and under the auspices, of the Empress Irene. For that Council\ndecreed, not only that images should be had in churches, but also that\nthey should be worshipped. And, notwithstanding what I have advanced, the\nauthority of the Council would raise a strong prejudice on the contrary\nside. Though, to confess the truth, I am not much concerned at this, as I\nam to show the reader their extreme madness, whose fondness for images\nexceeded any thing that was becoming in Christians. But let us despatch\nthis point first: the present advocates for the use of images, allege the\nauthority of that Nicene Council in their defence. There is a book extant,\nwritten in refutation of this practice, under the name of Charlemagne;\nwhich, from the diction, we may conclude was composed at the same time. In\nthis work are recited the opinions of the bishops who attended the\nCouncil, and the arguments they used in the controversy. John, the\ndelegate of the Eastern churches, said, “God created man in his own\nimage;” and hence he inferred that we ought to have images. The same\nprelate thought that images were recommended to us by this sentence: “Show\nme thy face, for it is glorious.” Another, to prove that they ought to be\nplaced on the altars, cited this testimony: “No man lighteth a candle, and\nputteth it under a bushel.” Another, to show the contemplation of these to\nbe useful to us, adduced a verse from a Psalm: “The light of thy\ncountenance, O Lord, is sealed upon us.” Another pressed this comparison\ninto his service: “As the patriarchs used the sacrifices of the heathen,\nso Christians ought to have the images of saints, instead of the idols of\nthe heathen.” In the same manner they tortured that expression, “Lord, I\nhave loved the beauty of thy house.” But the most ingenious of all was\ntheir interpretation of this passage: “As we have heard, so have we seen;”\nthat therefore God is known, not only by the hearing of his word, but by\nthe contemplation of images. Similar is the subtlety of Bishop Theodore:\n“God is glorious in his saints.” And in another place it is said, “In the\nsaints that are in the earth:” therefore this ought to be referred to\nimages. But their impertinencies and absurdities are so disgusting, that I\nam quite ashamed to repeat them.\nXV. When they dispute concerning adoration, they bring forward Jacob’s\nworshipping of Pharaoh, and of the staff of Joseph, and of the inscription\nerected by himself; although, in this last instance, they not only corrupt\nthe sense of the Scripture, but allege what is nowhere to be found. These\npassages also, “Worship his footstool;” “Worship in his holy hill;” and,\n“All the rich of the people shall supplicate thy face;” they consider as\napposite and conclusive proofs. If any one wished to represent the\nadvocates for images in a ridiculous point of view, could he possibly\nascribe to them greater and grosser instances of folly? But, that no doubt\nof this might remain, Theodosius, bishop of Mira, defends the propriety of\nworshipping images from the dreams of his archdeacon, as seriously as if\nhe had an immediate revelation from heaven. Now, let the advocates of\nimages go and urge upon us the decree of that Council; as though those\nvenerable fathers had not entirely destroyed all their credit by such\npuerile treatment of the sacred Scriptures, or such impious and shameful\nmutilation of them.\nXVI. I come now to those prodigies of impiety, which it is wonderful that\nthey ever ventured to broach; and more wonderful still, that they have not\nbeen opposed with universal detestation. It is right to expose this\nflagitious madness, that the worship of images may at least be deprived of\nthe pretence of antiquity, which the papists falsely urge in its favour.\nTheodosius, bishop of Amorum, denounces an anathema against all who are\naverse to the worship of images. Another imputes all the calamities of\nGreece and the East to the crime of not having worshipped them. What\npunishments, then, did the Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs deserve, in\nwhose time images were unknown? They add further, If the image of the\nemperor be met by processions with perfumes and incense, much more is this\nhonour due to the images of the saints. Constantius, bishop of Constance,\nin Cyprus, professes his reverence for images, and avows that he will pay\nthem the same worship and honour as is due to the Trinity, the source of\nall life; and whoever refuses to do the same, he anathematizes and\ndismisses with the Manichees and Marcionites. And, lest you should suppose\nthis to be the private opinion of an individual, they all declare their\nassent to it. John, the delegate of the Eastern churches, carried by the\nfervour of his zeal to still greater lengths, asserts it to be better to\nadmit all the brothels of the world into one city, than to reject the\nworship of images. At length it was unanimously decreed, that the\nSamaritans were worse than all heretics, and that the adversaries of\nimages were worse than the Samaritans. But, that the farce might not want\nits usual plaudit, they add this clause: “Let them rejoice and exult, who\nhave the image of Christ, and offer sacrifice to it.” Where is now the\ndistinction of _latria_ and _dulia_, with which they attempt to deceive\nboth God and men? For the Council gives the same honour, without any\nexception, to images and to the living God."

          "title": "Chapter XII. God Contradistinguished From Idols, That He May Be Solely And",
          "content": "Supremely Worshipped.\nWe said, at the beginning, that the knowledge of God consists not in\nfrigid speculation, but is accompanied by the worship of him. We also\ncursorily touched on the right method of worshipping him, which will be\nmore fully explained in other places. I now only repeat, in few words,\nthat whenever the Scripture asserts that there is but one God, it contends\nnot for the bare name, but also teaches, that whatever belongs to the\nDeity, should not be transferred to another. This shows how pure religion\ndiffers from idolatry. The Greek word ευσεβεια certainly signifies right\nworship, since even blind mortals, groping in the dark, have always\nperceived the necessity of some certain rule, that the worship of God may\nnot be involved in disorder and confusion. Although Cicero ingeniously and\ncorrectly derives the word _religion_ from a verb signifying “to read over\nagain,” or “to gather again;” yet the reason he assigns for it, that good\nworshippers often recollect, and diligently reconsider what is true, is\nforced and far‐fetched. I rather think the word is opposed to a liberty of\nwandering without restraint; because the greater part of the world rashly\nembrace whatever they meet with, and also ramble from one thing to\nanother; but piety, in order to walk with a steady step, collects itself\nwithin its proper limits. The word _superstition_ also appears to me to\nimport a discontent with the method and order prescribed, and an\naccumulation of a superfluous mass of vain things. But to leave the\nconsideration of words, it has been generally admitted, in all ages, that\nreligion is corrupted and perverted by errors and falsehoods; whence we\ninfer, that when we allow ourselves any thing from inconsiderate zeal, the\npretext alleged by the superstitious is altogether frivolous. Although\nthis confession is in the mouths of all, they betray, at the same time, a\nshameful ignorance, neither adhering to the one true God, nor observing\nany discrimination in his worship, as we have before shown. But God, to\nassert his own right, proclaims that he is “jealous,” and will be a severe\navenger, if men confound him with any fictitious deity; and then, to\nretain mankind in obedience, he defines his legitimate worship. He\ncomprises both in his law, where he first binds the faithful to himself,\nas their sole legislator; and then prescribes a rule for the right worship\nof him according to his will. Now, of the law, since the uses and ends of\nit are various, I shall treat in its proper place: at present, I only\nremark, that it sets up a barrier to prevent men turning aside to corrupt\nmodes of worship. Let us remember, what I have already stated, that,\nunless every thing belonging to Divinity remain in God alone, he is\nspoiled of his honour, and his worship is violated. And here it is\nnecessary to animadvert more particularly on the subtle fallacies of\nsuperstition. For it revolts not to strange gods, in such a manner as to\nappear to desert the supreme God, or to degrade him to a level with\nothers; but, allowing him the highest place, it surrounds him with a\nmultitude of inferior deities, among whom it distributes his honours; and\nthus, in a cunning and hypocritical manner, the glory of Divinity is\ndivided among many, instead of remaining wholly in one. Thus the ancient\nidolaters, Jews as well as Gentiles, imagined one God, the Father and\nGovernor of all, and subordinate to him a vast multitude of other deities;\nto whom, in common with the supreme God, they attributed the government of\nheaven and earth. Thus the saints, who departed out of this life some ages\nago, are exalted to the society of God, to be worshipped, and invoked, and\ncelebrated like him. We suppose, indeed, the glory of God not to be\nsullied with this abomination; whereas it is, in a great measure,\nsuppressed and extinguished, except that we retain some faint notion of\nhis supreme power; but, at the same time, deceived with such impostures,\nwe are seduced to the worship of various deities.\nII. On this account was invented the distinction of _latria_ and _dulia_,\nas they express themselves, by which they conceived they might safely\nascribe divine honours to angels and deceased men. For it is evident, that\nthe worship which papists pay to the saints, differs not in reality from\nthe worship of God; for they adore God and them promiscuously; but when\nthey are accused of it, they evade the charge with this subterfuge, that\nthey preserve inviolate to God what belongs to him, because they leave him\nλατρεια. But since the question relates to a thing, not to a word, who can\nbear their careless trifling on the most important of all subjects? But,\nto pass this also, they will gain nothing at last by their distinction,\nbut that they render worship to God alone, and service to the saints. For\nλατρεια, in Greek, signifies the same as _cultus_ in Latin, [and _worship_\nin English;] but δουλεια properly signifies _servitus_, [_service_;] and\nyet, in the Scriptures, this distinction is sometimes disregarded. But,\nsuppose it to be a constant distinction, it remains to be inquired, what\nis the meaning of each term. Λατρεια is _worship_; δουλεια is _service_.\nNow, no one doubts, that to serve is more than to worship or honour. For\nit would be irksome to serve many persons, whom you would not refuse to\nhonour. So unjust is the distribution, to assign the greater to the\nsaints, and leave to God that which is less. But many of the ancients, it\nis urged, have used this distinction. What is that to the purpose, if\nevery one perceives it to be not only improper, but altogether frivolous?\nIII. Leaving these subtleties, let us consider the subject itself. Paul,\nwhen he reminds the Galatians what they had been before they were\nilluminated in the knowledge of God, says, that they “did service to them\nwhich by nature were no gods.”(186) Though he mentions not λατρεια,\n(worship,) is their idolatry therefore excusable? He certainly condemns\nthat perverse superstition, which he denominates δουλεια, (service,)\nequally as much as if he had used the word λατρεια, (worship.) And when\nChrist repels the assault of Satan with this shield, “It is written, Thou\nshalt worship the Lord thy God,”(187) the word λατρεια came not into the\nquestion; for Satan required nothing but προσκυνησις, (prostration, or\nadoration.) So, when John is reprehended by an angel, for having fallen on\nhis knees before him,(188) we must not understand that John was so stupid\nas to intend to transfer to an angel the honour due exclusively to God.\nBut since all worship, that is connected with religion, cannot but savour\nof Divine, he could not (προσκυνειν) prostrate himself before the angel,\nwithout detracting from the glory of God. We read, indeed, frequently, of\nmen having been worshipped; but that was civil honour, so to speak;\nreligion has a different design; and no sooner is religion connected with\nworship, or homage, than it produces a profanation of the Divine honour.\nWe may see the same in Cornelius, who had not made such a small progress\nin piety, as not to ascribe supreme worship to God alone. When he “fell\ndown” before Peter, therefore, it certainly was not with an intention of\nworshipping him instead of God:(189) yet Peter positively forbade him to\ndo it. And why was this, but because men never so particularly distinguish\nbetween the worship or homage of God, and that of the creatures, as to\navoid transferring to a creature what belongs exclusively to God?\nWherefore, if we desire to have but one God, let us remember, that his\nglory ought not, in the least, to be diminished; but that he must retain\nall that belongs to him. Therefore Zechariah, when speaking of the\nrestoration of the Church, expressly declares, not only that “there shall\nbe one Lord,” but also “that his name shall be one;”(190) signifying,\nwithout doubt, that he will have nothing in common with idols. Now, what\nkind of worship God requires, will be seen, in due course, in another\nplace. For he hath been pleased, in his law, to prescribe to mankind what\nis lawful and right; and so to confine them to a certain rule, that every\nindividual might not take the liberty of inventing a mode of worship\naccording to his own fancy. But, since it is not proper to burden the\nreader, by confounding many subjects together, I shall not enter on that\npoint yet; let it suffice to know, that no religious services can be\ntransferred to any other than God alone, without committing sacrilege. At\nfirst, indeed, superstition ascribed Divine honours either to the sun, or\nto the other stars, or to idols. Afterwards followed ambition, which,\nadorning men with the spoils of God, dared to profane every thing that was\nsacred. And although there remained a persuasion, that they ought to\nworship a supreme God, yet it became customary to offer sacrifices\npromiscuously to genii, and inferior deities, and deceased heroes. So\nsteep is the descent to this vice, to communicate to a vast multitude that\nwhich God particularly challenges to himself alone!"

          "title": "Chapter XIII. One Divine Essence, Containing Three Persons; Taught In The",
          "content": "Scriptures From The Beginning.\nWhat is taught in the Scriptures concerning the immensity and spirituality\nof the essence of God, should serve not only to overthrow the foolish\nnotions of the vulgar, but also to refute the subtleties of profane\nphilosophy. One of the ancients,(191) in his own conception very shrewdly,\nsaid, that whatever we see, and whatever we do not see, is God. But he\nimagined that the Deity was diffused through every part of the world. But,\nalthough God, to keep us within the bounds of sobriety, speaks but rarely\nof his essence, yet, by those two attributes, which I have mentioned, he\nsupersedes all gross imaginations, and represses the presumption of the\nhuman mind. For, surely, his immensity ought to inspire us with awe, that\nwe may not attempt to measure him with our senses; and the spirituality of\nhis nature prohibits us from entertaining any earthly or carnal\nspeculations concerning him. For the same reason, he represents his\nresidence to be “in heaven;” for though, as he is incomprehensible, he\nfills the earth also; yet, seeing that our minds, from their dulness, are\ncontinually dwelling on the earth, in order to shake off our sloth and\ninactivity, he properly raises us above the world. And here is demolished\nthe error of the Manichees, who, by maintaining the existence of two\noriginal principles, made the devil, as it were, equal to God. This\ncertainly was both dividing the unity of God, and limiting his immensity.\nFor their daring to abuse certain testimonies of Scripture betrayed a\nshameful ignorance; as the error itself evidenced an execrable madness.\nThe Anthropomorphites also, who imagined God to be corporeal, because the\nScripture frequently ascribes to him a mouth, ears, eyes, hands, and feet,\nare easily refuted. For who, even of the meanest capacity, understands\nnot, that God lisps, as it were, with us, just as nurses are accustomed to\nspeak to infants? Wherefore, such forms of expression do not clearly\nexplain the nature of God, but accommodate the knowledge of him to our\nnarrow capacity; to accomplish which, the Scripture must necessarily\ndescend far below the height of his majesty.\nII. But he also designates himself by another peculiar character, by which\nhe may be yet more clearly distinguished; for, while he declares himself\nto be but One, he proposes himself to be distinctly considered in Three\nPersons, without apprehending which, we have only a bare and empty name of\nGod floating in our brains, without any idea of the true God. Now, that no\none may vainly dream of three gods, or suppose that the simple essence of\nGod is divided among the three Persons, we must seek for a short and easy\ndefinition, which will preserve us from all error. But since some\nviolently object to the word Person, as of human invention, we must first\nexamine the reasonableness of this objection. When the Apostle denominates\nthe Son the express image of the hypostasis of the Father, he undoubtedly\nascribes to the Father some subsistence, in which he differs from the Son.\nFor to understand this word as synonymous with Essence, (as some\ninterpreters have done, as though Christ, like wax impressed with a seal,\nrepresented in himself the substance of the Father,) were not only harsh,\nbut also absurd. For the essence of God being simple and indivisible, he\nwho contains all in himself, not in part, or by derivation, but in\ncomplete perfection, could not, without impropriety, and even absurdity,\nbe called the express image of it. But since the Father, although\ndistinguished by his own peculiar property, hath expressed himself\nentirely in his Son, it is with the greatest reason asserted that he hath\nmade his hypostasis conspicuous in him; with which the other appellation,\ngiven him in the same passage, of “the brightness of his glory,” exactly\ncorresponds. From the words of the Apostle, we certainly conclude, that\nthere is in the Father a proper hypostasis, which is conspicuous in the\nSon. And thence also we easily infer the hypostasis of the Son, which\ndistinguishes him from the Father. The same reasoning is applicable to the\nHoly Spirit; for we shall soon prove him also to be God; and yet he must,\nof necessity, be considered as distinct from the Father. But this is not a\ndistinction of the essence, which it is unlawful to represent as any other\nthan simple and undivided. It follows, therefore, if the testimony of the\nApostle be credited, that there are in God three _hypostases_. And, as the\nLatins have expressed the same thing by the word _person_, it is too\nfastidious and obstinate to contend about so clear a matter. If we wish to\ntranslate word for word, we may call it _subsistence_. Many, in the same\nsense, have called it _substance_. Nor has the word _person_ been used by\nthe Latins only; but the Greeks also, for the sake of testifying their\nconsent to this doctrine, taught the existence of three προσωπα (persons)\nin God. But both Greeks and Latins, notwithstanding any verbal difference,\nare in perfect harmony respecting the doctrine itself.\nIII. Now, though heretics rail at the word _person_, or some morose and\nobstinate men clamorously refuse to admit a name of human invention; since\nthey cannot make us assert that there are three, each of whom is entirely\nGod, nor yet that there are more gods than one, how very unreasonable is\nit to reprobate words which express nothing but what is testified and\nrecorded in the Scriptures! It were better, say they, to restrain not only\nour thoughts, but our expressions also, within the limits of the\nScripture, than to introduce exotic words, which may generate future\ndissensions and disputes; for thus we weary ourselves with verbal\ncontroversies; thus the truth is lost in altercation; thus charity expires\nin odious contention. If they call every word exotic, which cannot be\nfound in the Scriptures in so many syllables, they impose on us a law\nwhich is very unreasonable, and which condemns all interpretation, but\nwhat is composed of detached texts of Scripture connected together. But if\nby exotic they mean that which is curiously contrived, and superstitiously\ndefended, which tends to contention more than to edification, the use of\nwhich is either unseasonable or unprofitable, which offends pious ears\nwith its harshness, and seduces persons from the simplicity of the Divine\nword, I most cordially embrace their modest opinion. For I think that we\nought to speak of God with the same religious caution, which should govern\nour thoughts of him; since all the thoughts that we entertain concerning\nhim merely from ourselves, are foolish, and all our expressions absurd.\nBut there is a proper medium to be observed: we should seek in the\nScriptures a certain rule, both for thinking and for speaking; by which we\nmay regulate all the thoughts of our minds, and all the words of our\nmouths. But what forbids our expressing, in plainer words, those things\nwhich, in the Scriptures, are, to our understanding, intricate and\nobscure, provided our expressions religiously and faithfully convey the\ntrue sense of the Scripture, and are used with modest caution, and not\nwithout sufficient occasion? Of this, examples sufficiently numerous are\nnot wanting. But, when it shall have been proved, that the Church was\nabsolutely necessitated to use the terms Trinity and Persons, if any one\nthen censures the novelty of the words, may he not be justly considered as\noffended at the light of the truth? as having no other cause of censure,\nbut that the truth is explained and elucidated?\nIV. But such verbal novelty (if it must have this appellation) is\nprincipally used, when the truth is to be asserted in opposition to\nmalicious cavillers, who elude it by crafty evasions; of which we have too\nmuch experience in the present day, who find great difficulty in refuting\nthe enemies of pure and sound doctrine: possessed of serpentine lubricity,\nthey escape by the most artful expedients, unless they are vigorously\npursued, and held fast when once caught. Thus the ancients, pestered with\nvarious controversies against erroneous dogmas, were constrained to\nexpress their sentiments with the utmost perspicuity, that they might\nleave no subterfuges to the impious, who availed themselves of obscure\nexpressions, for the concealment of their errors. Unable to resist the\nclear testimonies of the Scriptures, Arius confessed Christ to be God, and\nthe Son of God; and, as though this were all that was necessary, he\npretended to agree with the Church at large. But, at the same time, he\ncontinued to maintain that Christ was created, and had a beginning like\nother creatures. To draw the versatile subtlety of this man from its\nconcealment, the ancient Fathers proceeded further, and declared Christ to\nbe the eternal Son of the Father, and consubstantial with the Father. Here\nimpiety openly discovered itself, when the Arians began inveterately to\nhate and execrate the name ὁμοούσιος, (consubstantial.) But if, in the\nfirst instance, they had sincerely and cordially confessed Christ to be\nGod, they would not have denied him to be consubstantial with the Father.\nWho can dare to censure those good men, as quarrelsome and contentious,\nfor having kindled such a flame of controversy, and disturbed the peace of\nthe Church on account of one little word? That little word distinguished\nChristians, who held the pure faith, from sacrilegious Arians. Afterwards\narose Sabellius, who considered the names of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,\nas little more than empty sounds; arguing, that they were not used on\naccount of any real distinction, but were different attributes of God,\nwhose attributes of this kind are numerous. If the point came to be\ncontroverted, he confessed, that he believed the Father to be God, the Son\nGod, and the Holy Spirit God; but he would readily evade all the force of\nthis confession, by adding, that he had said no other than if he had\ncalled God potent, and just, and wise. And thus he came to another\nconclusion, that the Father is the Son, and that the Holy Spirit is the\nFather, without any order or distinction. The good doctors of that age,\nwho had the interest of religion at heart, in order to counteract the\nwickedness of this man, maintained, on the contrary, that they ought\nreally to acknowledge three peculiar properties in one God. And, to defend\nthemselves against his intricate subtleties, by the plain and simple\ntruth, they affirmed, that they truly subsisted in the one God; or, what\nis the same, that in the unity of God there subsisted a trinity of\nPersons.\nV. If, then, the words have not been rashly invented, we should beware\nlest we be convicted of fastidious temerity in rejecting them. I could\nwish them, indeed, to be buried in oblivion, provided this faith were\nuniversally received, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are the one\nGod; and that nevertheless the Son is not the Father, nor the Spirit the\nSon, but that they are distinguished from each other by some peculiar\nproperty. I am not so rigidly precise as to be fond of contending for mere\nwords. For I observe that the ancients, who otherwise speak on these\nsubjects with great piety, are not consistent with each other, nor, in all\ncases, with themselves. For what forms of expression, adopted by councils,\ndoes Hilary excuse! To what extremes does Augustine sometimes proceed! How\ndifferent are the Greeks from the Latins! But of this variation, let one\nexample suffice: when the Latins would translate the word ὁμοούσιος, they\ncalled it _consubstantial_, signifying the _substance_ of the Father and\nthe Son to be one, and thus using _substance_ for _essence_. Whence also\nJerome, writing to Damasus, pronounces it to be sacrilege to say that\nthere are three _substances_ in God. Yet, that there are three\n_substances_ in God, you will find asserted in Hilary more than a hundred\ntimes. But how perplexed is Jerome on the word _hypostasis_! For he\nsuspects some latent poison in the assertion, that there are three\n_hypostases_ in God. And if any one uses this word in a pious sense, he\nrefrains not from calling it an improper expression; if, indeed, he was\nsincere in this declaration, and did not rather knowingly and wilfully\nendeavour to asperse, with a groundless calumny, the bishops of the East,\nwhom he hated. He certainly discovers not much ingenuousness in affirming\nthat, in all the profane schools, οὐσία (essence) is the same as\nὑπόστασις, (hypostasis,) which the trite and common use of the words\nuniversally contradicts. More modesty and liberality are discovered by\nAugustine, who, though he asserts that the word _hypostasis_, in this\nsense, is new to Latin ears, yet leaves the Greeks their usual\nphraseology, and even peaceably tolerates the Latins, who had imitated\ntheir language; and the account of Socrates, in the sixth book of his\nTripartite History, seems to imply, that it was by ignorant men that it\nhad first been improperly applied to this subject. The same Hilary accuses\nthe heretics of a great crime, in constraining him, by their wickedness,\nto expose to the danger of human language those things which ought to be\nconfined within the religion of the mind; plainly avowing that this is to\ndo things unlawful, to express things inexpressible, to assume things not\nconceded. A little after, he largely excuses himself for his boldness in\nbringing forward new terms; for, when he has used the names of nature,\nFather, Son, and Spirit, he immediately adds, that whatever is sought\nfurther, is beyond the signification of language, beyond the reach of our\nsenses, beyond the conception of our understanding. And, in another place,\nhe pronounces that happy were the bishops of Gaul, who had neither\ncomposed, nor received, nor even known, any other confession but that\nancient and very simple one, which had been received in all the churches\nfrom the days of the Apostles. Very similar is the excuse of Augustine,\nthat this word was extorted by necessity, on account of the poverty of\nhuman language on so great a subject, not for the sake of expressing what\nGod is, but to avoid passing it over in total silence, that the Father,\nSon, and Spirit are three. This moderation of those holy men should teach\nus, not to pass such severe censures on those who are unwilling to\nsubscribe to expressions adopted by us, provided they are not actuated by\npride, perverseness, or disingenuous subtlety. But let them also, on the\nother hand, consider the great necessity which constrains us to use such\nlanguage, that, by degrees, they may at length be accustomed to a useful\nphraseology. Let them also learn to beware, since we have to oppose the\nArians on one side, and the Sabellians on the other, lest, while they take\noffence at both these parties being deprived of all opportunity of\nevasion, they cause some suspicion that they are themselves the disciples\neither of Arius or of Sabellius. Arius confesses, “that Christ is God;”\nbut maintains also, “that he was created, and had a beginning.” He\nacknowledges that Christ is “one with the Father;” but secretly whispers\nin the ears of his disciples, that he is “united to him,” like the rest of\nthe faithful, though by a singular privilege. Say that he is\n_consubstantial_, you tear off the mask from the hypocrite, and yet you\nadd nothing to the Scriptures. Sabellius asserts, “that the names Father,\nSon, and Spirit, are expressive of no distinction in the Godhead.” Say\nthat they are three, and he will exclaim, that you are talking of “three\ngods.” Say, “that in the one essence of God there is a trinity of\nPersons,” and you will at once express what the Scriptures declare, and\nwill restrain such frivolous loquacity. Now, if any persons are prevented,\nby such excessive scrupulousness, from admitting these terms, yet not one\nof them can deny, that, when the Scripture speaks of one God, it should be\nunderstood of a unity of substance; and that, when it speaks of three in\none essence, it denotes the Persons in this trinity. When this is honestly\nconfessed, we have no further concern about words. But I have found, by\nlong and frequent experience, that those who pertinaciously contend about\nwords, cherish some latent poison; so that it were better designedly to\nprovoke their resentment, than to use obscure language for the sake of\nobtaining their favour.\nVI. But, leaving the dispute about terms, I shall now enter on the\ndiscussion of the subject itself. What I denominate a Person, is a\nsubsistence in the Divine essence, which is related to the others, and yet\ndistinguished from them by an incommunicable property. By the word\n_subsistence_ we mean something different from the word _essence_. For, if\nthe _Word_ were simply God, and had no peculiar property, John had been\nguilty of impropriety in saying that he was always _with God_.(192) When\nhe immediately adds, that _the Word_ also _was God_, he reminds us of the\nunity of the essence. But because he could not be _with God_, without\nsubsisting in the Father, hence arises that subsistence, which, although\ninseparably connected with the essence, has a peculiar mark, by which it\nis distinguished from it. Now, I say that each of the three subsistences\nhas a relation to the others, but is distinguished from them by a peculiar\nproperty. We particularly use the word _relation_, (or _comparison_,)\nhere, because, when mention is made simply and indefinitely of God, this\nname pertains no less to the Son and Spirit, than to the Father. But\nwhenever the Father is compared with the Son, the property peculiar to\neach distinguishes him from the other. Thirdly, whatever is proper to each\nof them, I assert to be incommunicable, because whatever is ascribed to\nthe Father as a character of distinction, cannot be applied or transferred\nto the Son. Nor, indeed, do I disapprove of the definition of Tertullian,\nif rightly understood: “That there is in God a certain distribution or\neconomy, which makes no change in the unity of the essence.”\nVII. But before I proceed any further, I must prove the Deity of the Son\nand of the Holy Spirit; after which we shall see how they differ from each\nother. When the Scripture speaks of _the Word of God_, it certainly were\nvery absurd to imagine it to be only a transient and momentary sound,\nemitted into the air, and coming forth from God himself; of which nature\nwere the oracles, given to the fathers, and all the prophecies. It is\nrather to be understood of the eternal wisdom residing in God, whence the\noracles, and all the prophecies, proceeded. For, according to the\ntestimony of Peter,(193) the ancient Prophets spake by the Spirit of\nChrist no less than the Apostles and all the succeeding ministers of the\nheavenly doctrine. But, as Christ had not yet been manifested, we must\nnecessarily understand that the Word was begotten of the Father before the\nworld began. And if the Spirit that inspired the Prophets was the Spirit\nof the Word, we conclude, beyond all doubt, that the Word was truly God.\nAnd this is taught by Moses, with sufficient perspicuity, in the creation\nof the world, in which he represents the Word as acting such a conspicuous\npart. For why does he relate that God, in the creation of each of his\nworks, said, Let this or that be done, but that the unsearchable glory of\nGod may resplendently appear in his image? Captious and loquacious men\nwould readily evade this argument, by saying, that the _Word_ imports an\norder or command; but the Apostles are better interpreters, who declare,\nthat the worlds were created by the Son, and that he “upholds all things\nby the word of his power.”(194) For here we see that the _Word_ intends\nthe nod or mandate of the Son, who is himself the eternal and essential\nSon of the Father. Nor, to the wise and sober, is there any obscurity in\nthat passage of Solomon, where he introduces Wisdom as begotten of the\nFather before time began, and presiding at the creation of the world, and\nover all the works of God. For, to pretend that this denotes some\ntemporary expression of the will of God, were foolish and frivolous;\nwhereas God then intended to discover his fixed and eternal counsel, and\neven something more secret. To the same purpose also is that assertion of\nChrist, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”(195) For, by affirming\nthat, from the beginning of the world, he had continually coöperated with\nthe Father, he makes a more explicit declaration of what had been briefly\nglanced at by Moses. We conclude, therefore, that God spake thus at the\ncreation, that the Word might have his part in the work, and so that\noperation be common to both. But John speaks more clearly than all others,\nwhen he represents _the Word_, who from the beginning _was God with God_,\nas in union with the Father, the original cause of all things. For to the\nWord he both attributes a real and permanent essence, and assigns some\npeculiar property; and plainly shows how God, by speaking, created the\nworld. Therefore, as all Divine revelations are justly entitled _the word\nof God_, so we ought chiefly to esteem that substantial Word the source of\nall revelations, who is liable to no variation, who remains with God\nperpetually one and the same, and who is God himself.\nVIII. Here we are interrupted by some clamorous objectors, who, since they\ncannot openly rob him of his divinity, secretly steal from him his\neternity. For they say, that the Word only began to exist, when God opened\nhis sacred mouth in the creation of the world. But they are too\ninconsiderate in imagining something new in the substance of God. For, as\nthose names of God, which relate to his external works, began to be\nascribed to him after the existence of those works, as when he is called\nthe Creator of heaven and earth, so piety neither acknowledges nor admits\nany name, signifying that God has found any thing new to happen to\nhimself. For, could any thing, from any quarter, effect a change in him,\nit would contradict the assertion of James, that “every good gift and\nevery perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of\nlights, with whom is no variableness or shadow of turning.”(196) Nothing,\nthen, is more intolerable, than to suppose a beginning of that Word, which\nwas always God, and afterwards the Creator of the world. But they argue,\nin their own apprehension most acutely, that Moses, by representing God as\nhaving then spoken for the first time, implies also, that there was no\nWord in him before; than which nothing is more absurd. For it is not to be\nconcluded, because any thing begins to be manifested at a certain time,\nthat it had no prior existence. I form a very different conclusion; that,\nsince, in the very instant when God said, “Let there be light,”(197) the\npower of the Word was clearly manifested, the Word must have existed long\nbefore. But if any one inquires, how long, he will find no beginning. For\nhe limits no certain period of time, when he himself says, “O Father,\nglorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee\nbefore the world was.”(198) Nor is this omitted by John; for, before he\ndescends to the creation of the world, he declares that the Word “was in\nthe beginning with God.”(199) We therefore conclude again, that the Word,\nconceived of God before time began, perpetually remained with him, which\nproves his eternity, his true essence, and his divinity.\nIX. Though I advert not yet to the person of the Mediator, but defer it to\nthat part of the work which will relate to redemption, yet, since it\nought, without controversy, to be believed by all, that Christ is the very\nsame Word clothed in flesh, any testimonies which assert the Deity of\nChrist, will be very properly introduced here. When it is said, in the\nforty‐fifth Psalm, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,” the Jews\nendeavour to evade its force, by pleading that the name Elohim is\napplicable also to angels, and to men of dignity and power. But there\ncannot be found in the Scripture a similar passage, which erects an\neternal throne for a creature; for he is not merely called God, but is\nalso declared to possess an eternal dominion. Besides, this title is never\ngiven to a creature, without some addition, as when it is said that Moses\nshould be “a god to Pharaoh.”(200) Some read it in the genitive case, “Thy\nthrone is of God,” which is extremely insipid. I confess, indeed, that\nwhat is eminently and singularly excellent, is frequently called Divine;\nbut it sufficiently appears from the context, that such a meaning would be\nuncouth and forced, and totally inapplicable here. But, if their\nperverseness refuse to yield this point, there certainly is no obscurity\nin Isaiah, where he introduces Christ as God, and as crowned with supreme\npower, which is the prerogative of God alone. “His name,” says he, “shall\nbe called the Mighty God, the Father of eternity,” &c.(201) Here also the\nJews object, and invert the reading of the passage in this manner: “This\nis the name by which the mighty God, the Father of eternity, shall call\nhim,” &c.; so that they would leave the Son only the title of Prince of\npeace. But to what purpose would so many epithets be accumulated in this\npassage on God the Father, when the design of the prophet is to\ndistinguish Christ by such eminent characters as may establish our faith\nin him? Wherefore, there can be no doubt that he is there denominated the\nMighty God, just as, a little before, he is called Immanuel. But nothing\ncan be required plainer than a passage in Jeremiah, that this should be\nthe name whereby the Branch of David shall be called “Jehovah our\nrighteousness.”(202) For since the Jews themselves teach, that all other\nnames of God are mere epithets, but that this alone, which they call\nineffable, is a proper name expressive of his Essence, we conclude, that\nthe Son is the one eternal God, who declares, in another place, that he\n“will not give his glory to another.”(203) This also they endeavour to\nevade, because Moses imposed this name on an altar which he built, and\nEzekiel on the city of the new Jerusalem. But who does not perceive, that\nthe altar was erected as a monument of Moses having been exalted by God,\nand that Jerusalem is honoured with the name of God, only as a testimony\nof the Divine presence? For thus speaks the prophet: “The name of the city\nshall be, Jehovah is there.”(204) But Moses expresses himself thus: He\n“built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah‐nissi,” (my\nexaltation.)(205) But there is more contention about another passage of\nJeremiah, where the same title is given to Jerusalem in these words: “This\nis the name wherewith she shall be called, Jehovah our\nrighteousness.”(206) But this testimony is so far from opposing the truth\nwhich we are defending, that it rather confirms it. For, having before\ntestified that Christ is the true Jehovah, from whom righteousness\nproceeds, he now pronounces that the church will have such a clear\napprehension of it, as to be able to glory in the same name. In the former\nplace, then, is shown the original cause of righteousness, in the latter\nthe effect.\nX. Now, if these things do not satisfy the Jews, I see not by what cavils\nthey can evade the accounts of Jehovah having so frequently appeared in\nthe character of an angel. An angel is said to have appeared to the holy\nfathers. He claims for himself the name of the eternal God. If it be\nobjected, that this is spoken with regard to the character which he\nsustains, this by no means removes the difficulty. For a servant would\nnever rob God of his honour, by permitting sacrifice to be offered to\nhimself. But the angel, refusing to eat bread, commands a sacrifice to be\noffered to Jehovah. He afterwards demonstrates that he is really Jehovah\nhimself. Therefore Manoah and his wife conclude, from this evidence, that\nthey have seen, not a mere angel, but God himself. Hence he says, “We\nshall surely die, because we have seen God.” When his wife replies, “If\nthe Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received” a sacrifice\n“at our hands,”(207) she clearly acknowledges him to be God, who before is\ncalled an angel. Moreover, the reply of the angel himself removes every\ndoubt: “Why askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?” So much\nthe more detestable is the impiety of Servetus, in asserting that God\nnever appeared to Abraham and the other patriarchs, but that they\nworshipped an angel in his stead. But the orthodox doctors of the church\nhave truly and wisely understood and taught, that the same chief angel was\nthe Word of God, who even then began to perform some services introductory\nto his execution of the office of Mediator. For though he was not yet\nincarnate, he descended, as it were, in a mediatorial capacity, that he\nmight approach the faithful with greater familiarity. His familiar\nintercourse with men gave him the name of an angel; yet he still retained\nwhat properly belonged to him, and continued the ineffably glorious God.\nThe same truth is attested by Hosea, who, after relating the wrestling of\nJacob with an angel, says, “The Lord (Jehovah) God of hosts; Jehovah is\nhis memorial.”(208) Servetus again cavils, that God employed the person of\nan angel; as though the prophet did not confirm what had been delivered by\nMoses,—“Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?” And the\nconfession of the holy patriarch, when he says, “I have seen God face to\nface,”(209) sufficiently declares, that he was not a created angel, but\none in whom resided the fulness of Deity. Hence, also, the representation\nof Paul, that Christ was the conductor of the people in the wilderness;\nbecause, though the time of his humiliation was not yet arrived, the\neternal Word then exhibited a type of the office to which he was\nappointed. Now, if the second chapter of Zechariah be strictly and coolly\nexamined, the angel who sends another angel is immediately pronounced the\nGod of hosts, and supreme power is ascribed to him. I omit testimonies\ninnumerable on which our faith safely rests, although they have little\ninfluence on the Jews. For when it is said in Isaiah, “Lo, this is our\nGod; we have waited for him, and he will save us; this is Jehovah;”(210)\nall who have eyes may perceive that this is God, who arises for the\nsalvation of his people. And the emphatical repetition of these pointed\nexpressions forbids an application of this passage to any other than to\nChrist. But still more plain and decisive is a passage of Malachi, where\nhe prophesies, that “the Lord, who was then sought, should come into his\ntemple.”(211) The temple was exclusively consecrated to the one Most High\nGod; yet the prophet claims it as belonging to Christ. Whence it follows,\nthat he is the same God that was always worshipped among the Jews.\nXI. The New Testament abounds with innumerable testimonies. We must,\ntherefore, endeavour briefly to select a few, rather than to collect them\nall. Though the Apostles spake of him after he had appeared in flesh as\nthe Mediator, yet all that I shall adduce will be adapted to prove his\neternal Deity. In the first place, it is worthy of particular observation,\nthat the apostle represents those things which were predicted concerning\nthe eternal God, as either already exhibited in Christ, or to be\naccomplished in him at some future period. The prediction of Isaiah, that\nthe Lord of Hosts would be “for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of\noffence to both the houses of Israel,”(212) Paul asserts to have been\nfulfilled in Christ.(213) Therefore he declares, that Christ is the Lord\nof Hosts. There is a similar instance in another place: “We shall all\nstand,” says he, “before the judgment‐seat of Christ. For it is written,\nAs I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue\nshall confess to God.”(214) Since God, in Isaiah,(215) declares this\nconcerning himself, and Christ actually exhibits it in his own person, it\nfollows, that he is that very God, whose glory cannot be transferred to\nanother. The apostle’s quotation from the Psalms also, in his Epistle to\nthe Ephesians, is evidently applicable to none but God: “When he ascended\nup on high, he led captivity captive:”(216) understanding that ascension\nto have been prefigured by the exertions of the Divine power in the signal\nvictories of David over the heathen nations, he signifies, that the text\nwas more fully accomplished in Christ. Thus John attests that it was the\nglory of the Son which was revealed in a vision to Isaiah; whereas the\nprophet himself records that he saw the majesty of God.(217) And those\npraises which the Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, ascribes to the\nSon, beyond all doubt most evidently belong to God: “Thou, Lord, in the\nbeginning, hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the\nworks of thine hands,” &c. Again, “Let all the angels of God worship\nhim.”(218) Nor is it any misapplication of them, when he refers them to\nChrist; since all that is predicted in those Psalms has been accomplished\nonly by him. For it was He who arose and had mercy upon Zion; it was He\nwho claimed as his own the dominion over all nations and islands. And why\nshould John, after having affirmed, at the commencement of his\nGospel,(219) that the Word was always God, have hesitated to attribute to\nChrist the majesty of God? And why should Paul have been afraid to place\nChrist on the tribunal of God,(220) after having so publicly preached his\nDivinity, when he called him “God blessed for ever?”(221) And, to show how\nconsistent he is with himself on this subject, he says, also, that “God\nwas manifest in the flesh.”(222) If he is “God blessed for ever,” he is\nthe same to whom this apostle, in another place, affirms all glory and\nhonour to be due. And he conceals not, but openly proclaims, that, “being\nin the form of God,” he “thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but\nmade himself of no reputation.”(223) And, lest the impious might object,\nthat he is a sort of artificial God, John goes further, and affirms, that\n“This is the true God, and eternal life;”(224) although we ought to be\nfully satisfied by his being called God, especially by a witness who\nexpressly avers that there are no more gods than one; I mean Paul, who\nsays, “though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in\nearth; to us there is but one God, of whom are all things.”(225) When we\nhear, from the same mouth, that “God was manifested in the flesh,” that\n“God hath purchased the Church with his own blood,”—why do we imagine a\nsecond God, whom he by no means acknowledges? And there is no doubt that\nall the pious were of the same opinion. Thomas, likewise, by publicly\nconfessing him to be “his Lord and God,” declares him to be the same true\nGod whom he had always worshipped.(226)\nXII. If we judge of his Divinity from the works which the Scriptures\nattribute to him, it will thence appear with increasing evidence. For when\nhe said, that he had, from the beginning, continually coöperated with the\nFather, the Jews, stupid as they were about his other declarations, yet\nperceived, that he assumed to himself Divine power; and, therefore, as\nJohn informs us, they “sought the more to kill him; because he not only\nhad broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making\nhimself equal with God.”(227) How great, then, must be our stupidity, if\nwe perceive not this passage to be a plain assertion of his Divinity! To\npreside over the world by his almighty providence, and to govern all\nthings by the rod of his own power, (which the Apostle attributes to\nhim,)(228) belongs exclusively to the Creator. And he participates with\nthe Father, not only in the government of the world, but also in all other\noffices, which cannot be communicated to creatures. The Lord proclaims, by\nthe prophet, “I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions, for\nmine own sake.”(229) According to this declaration, when the Jews thought\nthat Christ committed an injury against God, by undertaking to forgive\nsins,(230) he not only asserted in express terms, that this power belonged\nto him, but proved it by a miracle. We see, therefore, that he hath not\nthe ministry, but the power of remission of sins, which the Lord declares\nshall never be transferred from himself to another. Is it not the\nprerogative of God alone to examine and penetrate the secret thoughts of\nthe heart? Yet Christ possessed that power; which is a proof of his\nDivinity.\nXIII. But with what perspicuity of evidence does it appear in his\nmiracles! Though I grant that the Prophets and Apostles performed miracles\nsimilar and equal to his, yet there is a considerable difference in this\nrespect, that they, in their ministry, dispensed the favours of God,\nwhereas his miracles were performed by his exertions of his own power. He\nsometimes, indeed, used prayer, that he might glorify the Father; but, in\nmost instances, we perceive the manifest displays of his own power. And\nhow should not he be the true author of miracles, who, by his own\nauthority, committed the dispensation of them to others? For the\nEvangelists relate, that he gave his Apostles power to raise the dead, to\nheal the leprous, to cast out devils, &c.(231) And they performed that\nministry in such a manner, as plainly to discover, that the power\nproceeded solely from Christ. “In the name of Jesus Christ,” says Peter,\n“arise and walk.”(232) It is no wonder, therefore, that Christ should\nbring forward his miracles,(233) to convince the incredulity of the Jews,\nsince, being performed by his own power, they afforded most ample evidence\nof his Divinity. Besides, if out of God there be no salvation, no\nrighteousness, no life, but Christ contains all these things in himself,\nit certainly demonstrates him to be God. Let it not be objected, that life\nand salvation are infused into him by God; for he is not said to have\nreceived salvation, but to be himself salvation. And if no one be good but\nGod alone,(234) how can he be a mere man who is, I will not say good and\nrighteous, but goodness and righteousness itself? Even from the beginning\nof the creation, according to the testimony of an Evangelist, “in him was\nlife; and the life” then existed as “the light of men.” Supported by such\nproofs, therefore, we venture to repose our faith and hope on him; whereas\nwe know that it is impious and sacrilegious for any man to place his\nconfidence in creatures. He says, “Ye believe in God, believe also in\nme.”(235) And in this sense Paul interprets two passages of\nIsaiah—“Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.” Again, “There\nshall be a root of Jesse, that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in\nhim shall the Gentiles trust.”(236) And why should we search for more\ntestimonies from Scripture, when this declaration occurs so frequently,\n“He that believeth on me hath everlasting life”?(237) The invocation,\narising from faith, is also directed to him; which, nevertheless,\npeculiarly belongs, if any thing peculiarly belongs, to the Divine\nmajesty. For a prophet says, “Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord\n(Jehovah) shall be delivered.”(238) And Solomon, “The name of the Lord is\na strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.”(239) But the\nname of Christ is invoked for salvation: it follows, therefore, that he is\nJehovah. Moreover, we have an example of such invocation in Stephen, when\nhe says, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”(240) And afterwards in the whole\nChurch, as Ananias testifies in the same book: “Lord, I have heard by many\nof this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints—that call on thy\nname.”(241) And to make it more clearly understood, that “all the fulness\nof the Godhead dwelleth bodily in Christ,” the Apostle confesses that he\nhad introduced among the Corinthians no other doctrine than the knowledge\nof him, and that this had been the only subject of his preaching.(242)\nWhat a remarkable and important consideration is it, that the name of the\nSon only is preached to us, whereas God commands us to glory in the\nknowledge of himself alone!(243) Who can dare to assert that he is a mere\ncreature, the knowledge of whom is our only glory? It must also be\nremarked, that the salutations prefixed to the epistles of Paul implore\nthe same blessings from the Son as from the Father; whence we learn, not\nonly that those things, which our heavenly Father bestows, are obtained\nfor us by his intercession, but that the Son, by a communion of power, is\nhimself the author of them. This practical knowledge is unquestionably\nmore certain and solid than any idle speculation. For then the pious mind\nhas the nearest view of the Divine presence, and almost touches it, when\nit experiences itself to be quickened, illuminated, saved, justified, and\nsanctified.\nXIV. Wherefore the proof of the Deity of the Spirit must be derived\nprincipally from the same sources. There is no obscurity in the testimony\nof Moses, in the history of the creation, that the Spirit of God was\nexpanded on the abyss or chaos;(244) for it signifies, not only that the\nbeautiful state of the world which we now behold owes its preservation to\nthe power of the Spirit, but that, previously to its being thus adorned,\nthe Spirit was engaged in brooding over the confused mass. The declaration\nof Isaiah bids defiance to all cavils: “And now the Lord God, and his\nSpirit, hath sent me.”(245) For the Holy Spirit is united in the exercise\nof supreme power in the mission of Prophets, which is a proof of his\nDivine majesty. But the best confirmation, as I have remarked, we shall\nderive from familiar experience. For what the Scriptures ascribe to him,\nand what we ourselves learn by the certain experience of piety, is not at\nall applicable to any creature. For it is he who, being universally\ndiffused, sustains and animates all things in heaven and in earth. And\nthis very thing excludes him from the number of creatures, that he is\ncircumscribed by no limits, but transfuses through all his own vigorous\ninfluence, to inspire them with being, life, and motion: this is clearly a\nwork of Deity. Again, if regeneration to an incorruptible life be more\nimportant and excellent than any present life, what must we think of him\nfrom whose power it proceeds? But the Scripture teaches, in various\nplaces, that he is the author of regeneration by a power not derived, but\nproperly his own; and not of regeneration only, but likewise of the future\nimmortality. Finally, to him, as well as to the Son, are applied all those\noffices which are peculiar to Deity. For he “searcheth even the deep\nthings of God,”(246) who admits no creature to a share in his councils. He\nbestows wisdom and the faculty of speech;(247) whereas the Lord declares\nto Moses, that this can only be done by himself.(248) So through him we\nattain to a participation of God, to feel his vivifying energy upon us.\nOur justification is his work. From him proceed power, sanctification,\ntruth, grace, and every other blessing we can conceive; since there is but\none Spirit, from whom every kind of gifts descends. For this passage of\nPaul is worthy of particular attention: “There are diversities of gifts,\nand there are differences of administrations, but the same Spirit;”(249)\nbecause it represents him, not only as the principle and source of them,\nbut also as the author; which is yet more clearly expressed a little after\nin these words: “All these worketh that only and the self‐same Spirit,\ndividing to every man severally as he will.” For if he were not a\nsubsistence in the Deity, judgment and voluntary determination would never\nbe ascribed to him. Paul, therefore, very clearly attributes to the Spirit\nDivine power, and thereby demonstrates him to be an hypostasis or\nsubsistence in God.\nXV. Nor does the Scripture, when it speaks of him, refrain from giving him\nthe appellation of God. For Paul concludes that we are the temple of God,\nbecause his Spirit dwelleth in us.(250) This must not be passed over\nwithout particular notice; for the frequent promises of God, that he will\nchoose us for a temple for himself, receive no other accomplishment, than\nby the inhabitation of his Spirit in us. Certainly, as Augustine\nexcellently observes, “If we were commanded to erect to the Spirit a\ntemple of wood and stone, forasmuch as God is the sole object of worship,\nit would be a clear proof of his Divinity; how much clearer, then, is the\nproof, now that we are commanded, not to erect one, but to be ourselves\nhis temples!” And the Apostle calls us sometimes the temple of God, and\nsometimes the temple of the Holy Spirit, both in the same signification.\nPeter, reprehending Ananias for having “lied to the Holy Ghost,” told him\nthat he had “not lied unto men, but unto God.”(251) And where Isaiah(252)\nintroduces the Lord of hosts as the speaker, Paul(253) informs us that it\nis the Holy Spirit who speaks. Indeed, while the Prophets invariably\ndeclare, that the words which they utter are those of the Lord of hosts,\nChrist and the Apostles refer them to the Holy Spirit; whence it follows,\nthat he is the true Jehovah, who is the primary author of the prophecies.\nAgain, God complains that his anger was provoked by the perverseness of\nthe people; Isaiah, in reference to the same conduct, says, that “they\nvexed his Holy Spirit.”(254) Lastly, if blasphemy against the Spirit be\nnot forgiven, either in this world or in that which is to come,(255)\nwhilst a man may obtain pardon who has been guilty of blasphemy against\nthe Son, this is an open declaration of his Divine majesty, to defame or\ndegrade which is an inexpiable crime. I intentionally pass over many\ntestimonies which were used by the fathers. To them there appeared much\nplausibility in citing this passage from David, “By the word of the Lord\nwere the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his\nmouth;”(256) to prove that the creation of the world was the work of the\nHoly Spirit, as well as of the Son. But since a repetition of the same\nthing twice is common in the Psalms, and in Isaiah “the spirit of his\nmouth” means the same as “his word,” this is but a weak argument.\nTherefore I have determined to confine myself to a sober statement of\nthose evidences on which pious minds may satisfactorily rest.\nXVI. As God afforded a clearer manifestation of himself at the advent of\nChrist, the three Persons also then became better known. Among many\ntestimonies, let us be satisfied with this one: Paul connects together\nthese three, Lord, Faith, and Baptism,(257) in such a manner as to reason\nfrom one to another. Since there is but one faith, hence he proves that\nthere is but one Lord; since there is but one baptism, he shows that there\nis also but one faith. Therefore, if we are initiated by baptism into the\nfaith and religion of one God, we must necessarily suppose him to be the\ntrue God, into whose name we are baptized. Nor can it be doubted but that\nin this solemn commission, “Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of\nthe Son, and of the Holy Ghost,” Christ intended to testify, that the\nperfect light of faith was now exhibited. For this is equivalent to being\nbaptized into the name of the one God, who hath clearly manifested himself\nin the Father, Son, and Spirit; whence it evidently appears, that in the\nDivine Essence there exist three Persons, in whom is known the one God.\nAnd truly, since faith ought not to be looking about hither and thither,\nor to be wandering through the varieties of inconstancy, but to direct its\nviews towards the one God, to be fixed on him, and to adhere to him,—it\nmay easily be proved from these premises, that, if there be various kinds\nof faith, there must also be a plurality of gods. Baptism, being a\nsacrament of faith, confirms to us the unity of God, because it is but\none. Hence, also, we conclude, that it is not lawful to be baptized,\nexcept into the name of the one God; because we embrace the faith of him,\ninto whose name we are baptized. What, then, was intended by Christ, when\nhe commanded baptism to be administered in the name of the Father, and of\nthe Son, and of the Holy Spirit, but that one faith ought to be exercised\nin the Father, Son, and Spirit? and what is that but a clear testimony,\nthat the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are the one God? Therefore,\nsince it is an undeniable truth, that there is one God, and only one, we\nconclude the Word and Spirit to be no other than the very Essence of the\nDeity. The greatest degree of folly was betrayed by the Arians, who\nconfessed the Divinity of the Son, but denied him to possess the substance\nof God. Nor were the Macedonians free from a similar delusion, who would\nexplain the term “Spirit” to mean only the gifts of grace conferred upon\nman. For as wisdom, understanding, prudence, fortitude, and the fear of\nthe Lord, proceed from him, so he alone is the Spirit of wisdom, prudence,\nfortitude, and piety. Nor is he himself divided according to the\ndistribution of his graces; but, as the Apostle declares, how variously\nsoever they are divided, he always remains one and the same.(258)\nXVII. On the other hand, also, we find in the Scriptures a distinction\nbetween the Father and the Word, between the Word and the Spirit; in the\ndiscussion of which the magnitude of the mystery reminds us that we ought\nto proceed with the utmost reverence and sobriety. I am exceedingly\npleased with this observation of Gregory Nazianzen: “I cannot think of the\n_one_, but I am immediately surrounded with the splendour of the _three_;\nnor can I clearly discover the _three_, but I am suddenly carried back to\nthe _one_.” Wherefore let us not imagine such a trinity of Persons, as\nincludes an idea of separation, or does not immediately recall us to the\nunity. The names of Father, Son, and Spirit, certainly imply a real\ndistinction; let no one suppose them to be mere epithets, by which God is\nvariously designated from his works; but it is a distinction, not a\ndivision. The passages already cited show, that the Son has a property, by\nwhich he is distinguished from the Father; because the Word had not been\nwith God, or had his glory with the Father, unless he had been distinct\nfrom him. He likewise distinguishes the Father from himself, when he says,\n“that there is another that beareth witness of him.”(259) And to the same\neffect is what is declared in another place, that the Father created all\nthings by the Word; which he could not have done, unless he had been in\nsome sense distinct from him. Besides, the Father descended not to the\nearth, but he who came forth from the Father. The Father neither died nor\nrose again, but he who was sent by the Father. Nor did this distinction\ncommence at the incarnation, but it is evident, that, before that period,\nhe was the only begotten in the bosom of the Father.(260) For who can\nundertake to assert, that the Son first entered into the bosom of the\nFather, when he descended from heaven to assume a human nature? He,\ntherefore, was in the bosom of the Father before, and possessed his glory\nwith the Father. The distinction between the Holy Spirit and the Father is\nannounced by Christ, when he says, that he “proceedeth from the\nFather.”(261) But how often does he represent him as another, distinct\nfrom himself! as when he promises that “another Comforter”(262) should be\nsent, and in many other places.\nXVIII. I doubt the propriety of borrowing similitudes from human things,\nto express the force of this distinction. The fathers sometimes practise\nthis method; but they likewise confess the great disproportion of all the\nsimilitudes which they introduce. Wherefore I greatly dread, in this\ninstance, every degree of presumption; lest the introduction of any thing\nunseasonable should afford an occasion of calumny to the malicious, or of\nerror to the ignorant. Yet it is not right to be silent on the distinction\nwhich we find expressed in the Scriptures; which is this—that to the\nFather is attributed the principle of action, the fountain and source of\nall things; to the Son, wisdom, counsel, and the arrangement of all\noperations; and the power and efficacy of the action is assigned to the\nSpirit. Moreover, though eternity belongs to the Father, and to the Son\nand Spirit also, since God can never have been destitute of his wisdom or\nhis power, and in eternity we must not inquire after any thing prior or\nposterior,—yet the observation of order is not vain or superfluous, while\nthe Father is mentioned as first; in the next place the Son, as from him;\nand then the Spirit, as from both. For the mind of every man naturally\ninclines to the consideration, first, of God; secondly, of the wisdom\nemanating from him; and lastly, of the power by which he executes the\ndecrees of his wisdom. For this reason the Son is said to be from the\nFather, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son; and that in\nvarious places, but nowhere more clearly than in the eighth chapter of the\nEpistle to the Romans, where the same Spirit is indifferently denominated\n“the Spirit of Christ,” and “the Spirit of him that raised up Christ from\nthe dead,” and that without any impropriety. For Peter also testifies that\nit was the Spirit of Christ by whom the prophets prophesied;(263) whereas\nthe Scripture so frequently declares that it was the Spirit of God the\nFather.\nXIX. This distinction is so far from opposing the most absolute simplicity\nand unity of the Divine Being, that it affords a proof that the Son is one\nGod with the Father, because he has the same Spirit with him; and that the\nSpirit is not a different substance from the Father and the Son, because\nhe is the Spirit of the Father and of the Son. For the whole nature is in\neach hypostasis, and each has something peculiar to himself. The Father is\nentirely in the Son, and the Son entirely in the Father, according to his\nown declaration, “I am in the Father, and the Father in me;”(264) nor do\necclesiastical writers allow that one is divided from the other by any\ndifference of essence. “These distinctive appellations,” says Augustine,\n“denote their reciprocal relations to each other, and not the substance\nitself, which is but one.” This explanation may serve to reconcile the\nopinions of the fathers, which would otherwise appear totally repugnant to\neach other. For sometimes they state that the Son originates from the\nFather, and at other times assert that he has essential Divinity from\nhimself, and so is, together with the Father, the one first cause of all.\nAugustine, in another place, admirably and perspicuously explains the\ncause of this diversity, in the following manner: “Christ, considered in\nhimself, is called God; but with relation to the Father, he is called the\nSon.” And again, “The Father, considered in himself, is called God; but\nwith relation to the Son, he is called the Father. He who, with relation\nto the Son, is called the Father, is not the Son; he who, with relation to\nthe Father, is called the Son, is not the Father; they who are severally\ncalled the Father and the Son, are the same God.” Therefore, when we speak\nsimply of the Son, without reference to the Father, we truly and properly\nassert him to be self‐existent, and therefore call him the sole first\ncause; but, when we distinctly treat of the relation between him and the\nFather, we justly represent him as originating from the Father. The first\nbook of Augustine on the Trinity is entirely occupied with the explication\nof this subject; and it is far more safe to rest satisfied with that\nrelation which he states, than by curiously penetrating into the sublime\nmystery, to wander through a multitude of vain speculations.\nXX. Therefore, let such as love sobriety, and will be contented with the\nmeasure of faith, briefly attend to what is useful to be known; which is,\nthat, when we profess to believe in one God, the word _God_ denotes a\nsingle and simple essence, in which we comprehend three Persons, or\nhypostases; and that, therefore, whenever the word _God_ is used\nindefinitely, the Son and Spirit are intended as much as the Father; but\nwhen the Son is associated with the Father, that introduces the reciprocal\nrelation of one to the other; and thus we distinguish between the Persons.\nBut, since the peculiar properties of the Persons produce a certain order,\nso that the original cause is in the Father, whenever the Father and the\nSon or Spirit are mentioned together, the name of God is peculiarly\nascribed to the Father: by this method the unity of the essence is\npreserved, and the order is retained; which, however, derogates nothing\nfrom the Deity of the Son and Spirit. And indeed, as we have already seen\nthat the Apostles assert him to be the Son of God, whom Moses and the\nProphets have represented as Jehovah, it is always necessary to recur to\nthe unity of the essence. Wherefore it would be a detestable sacrilege for\nus to call the Son another God different from the Father; because the\nsimple name of God admits of no relation; nor can God, with respect to\nhimself, be denominated either the one or the other. Now, that the name\n“Jehovah,” in an indefinite sense, is applicable to Christ, appears even\nfrom the words of Paul: “for this thing I besought the Lord thrice;”(265)\nbecause, after relating the answer of Christ, “My grace is sufficient for\nthee,” he immediately subjoins, “That the power of Christ may rest upon\nme.” For it is certain that the word “Lord” is there used for “Jehovah;”\nand to restrict it to the person of the Mediator, would be frivolous and\npuerile, since it is an absolute declaration, containing no comparison\nbetween the Son and the Father. And we know that the Apostles, following\nthe custom of the Greek translators, invariably use the word Κυριος,\n(Lord,) instead of Jehovah. And, not to seek far for an example of this,\nPaul prayed to the Lord in no other sense than is intended in a passage of\nJoel, cited by Peter: “Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall\nbe saved.”(266) But for the peculiar ascription of this name to the Son,\nanother reason will be given in its proper place; suffice it at present to\nobserve that, when Paul had prayed to God absolutely, he immediately\nsubjoins the name of Christ. Thus also the whole Deity is by Christ\nhimself denominated “a Spirit.” For nothing opposes the spirituality of\nthe whole Divine essence, in which are comprehended the Father, the Son,\nand the Spirit; which is plain from the Scripture. For as we there find\nGod denominated a Spirit, so we find also the Holy Spirit, forasmuch as he\nis an hypostasis of the whole essence, represented both as the Spirit of\nGod, and as proceeding from God.\nXXI. But since Satan, in order to subvert the very foundations of our\nfaith, has always been exciting great contentions concerning the Divine\nessence of the Son and Spirit, and the distinction of the Persons; and in\nalmost all ages has instigated impious spirits to vex the orthodox\nteachers on this account; and is also endeavouring, in the present day,\nwith the old embers, to kindle a new flame; it becomes necessary here to\nrefute the perverse and fanciful notions which some persons have imbibed.\nHitherto it has been our principal design to instruct the docile, and not\nto combat the obstinate and contentious: but now, having calmly explained\nand proved the truth, we must vindicate it from all the cavils of the\nwicked; although I shall make it my principal study, that those who\nreadily and implicitly attend to the Divine word, may have stable ground\non which they may confidently rest. On this, indeed, if on any of the\nsecret mysteries of the Scripture, we ought to philosophize with great\nsobriety and moderation; and also with extreme caution, lest either our\nideas or our language should proceed beyond the limits of the Divine word.\nFor how can the infinite essence of God be defined by the narrow capacity\nof the human mind, which could never yet certainly determine the nature of\nthe body of the sun, though the object of our daily contemplation? How can\nthe human mind, by its own efforts, penetrate into an examination of the\nessence of God, when it is totally ignorant of its own? Wherefore let us\nfreely leave to God the knowledge of himself. For “he alone,” as Hilary\nsays, “is a competent witness for himself, being only known by himself.”\nAnd we shall certainly leave it to him, if our conceptions of him\ncorrespond to the manifestations which he has given us of himself, and our\ninquiries concerning him are confined to his word. There are extant on\nthis argument five homilies of Chrysostom against the Anomœi; which,\nhowever, were not sufficient to restrain the presumptuous garrulity of\nthose sophists. For they discovered no greater modesty in this instance\nthan in every other. The very unhappy consequences of this temerity should\nwarn us to study this question with more docility than subtlety, and not\nallow ourselves to investigate God any where but in his sacred word, or to\nform any ideas of him but such as are agreeable to his word, or to speak\nany thing concerning him but what is derived from the same word. But if\nthe distinction of Father, Son, and Spirit, in the one Deity, as it is not\neasy to be comprehended, occasions some understandings more labour and\ntrouble than is desirable, let them remember that the mind of man, when it\nindulges its curiosity, enters into a labyrinth; and let them submit to be\nguided by the heavenly oracles, however they may not comprehend the height\nof this mystery.\nXXII. To compose a catalogue of the errors, by which the purity of the\nfaith has been attacked on this point of doctrine, would be too prolix and\ntedious, without being profitable; and most of the heretics so strenuously\nexerted themselves to effect the total extinction of the Divine glory by\ntheir gross reveries, that they thought it sufficient to unsettle and\ndisturb the inexperienced. From a few men there soon arose numerous sects,\nof whom some would divide the Divine essence, and others would confound\nthe distinction which subsists between the Persons. But if we maintain,\nwhat has already been sufficiently demonstrated from the Scripture, that\nthe essence of the one God, which pertains to the Father, to the Son, and\nto the Spirit, is simple and undivided, and, on the other hand, that the\nFather is, by some property, distinguished from the Son, and likewise the\nSon from the Spirit, the gate will be shut, not only against Arius and\nSabellius, but also against all the other ancient heresiarchs. But since\nour own times have witnessed some madmen, as Servetus and his followers,\nwho have involved every thing in new subtleties, a brief exposure of their\nfallacies will not be unuseful. The word _Trinity_ was so odious and even\ndetestable to Servetus, that he asserted all Trinitarians, as he called\nthem, to be Atheists. I omit his impertinent and scurrilous language, but\nthis was the substance of his speculations: That it is representing God as\nconsisting of three parts, when three Persons are said to subsist in his\nessence, and that this triad is merely imaginary, being repugnant to the\nDivine unity. At the same time, he maintained the Persons to be certain\nexternal ideas, which have no real subsistence in the Divine essence, but\ngive us a figurative representation of God, under this or the other form;\nand that in the beginning there was no distinction in God, because the\nWord was once the same as the Spirit; but that, after Christ appeared God\nof God, there emanated from him another God, even the Spirit. Though he\nsometimes glosses over his impertinencies with allegories, as when he\nsays, that the eternal Word of God was the Spirit of Christ with God, and\nthe reflection of his image, and that the Spirit was a shadow of the\nDeity, yet he afterwards destroys the Deity of both, asserting that,\naccording to the mode of dispensation, there is a part of God in both the\nSon and the Spirit; just as the same Spirit, substantially diffused in us,\nand even in wood and stones, is a portion of the Deity. What he broached\nconcerning the Person of the Mediator, we shall examine in the proper\nplace. But this monstrous fiction, that a Divine Person is nothing but a\nvisible appearance of the glory of God, will not need a prolix refutation.\nFor when John pronounces that the Word (Λογος) was God before the creation\nof the world, he sufficiently discriminates him from an ideal form. But if\nthen also, and from the remotest eternity, that Word (Λογος) who was God,\nwas with the Father, and possessed his own glory with the Father, he\ncertainly could not be an external or figurative splendour; but it\nnecessarily follows, that he was a real hypostasis, subsisting in God\nhimself. But although no mention is made of the Spirit, but in the history\nof the creation of the world, yet he is there introduced, not as a shadow,\nbut as the essential power of God, since Moses relates that the chaotic\nmass was supported by him.(267) It then appeared, therefore, that the\neternal Spirit had always existed in the Deity, since he cherished and\nsustained the confused matter of the heaven and earth, till it attained a\nstate of beauty and order. He certainly could not then be an image or\nrepresentation of God, according to the dreams of Servetus. But in other\nplaces he is constrained to make a fuller disclosure of his impiety,\nsaying that God, in his eternal reason, decreeing for himself a visible\nSon, has visibly exhibited himself in this manner; for if this be true,\nthere is no other Divinity left to Christ, than as he has been appointed a\nSon by an eternal decree of God. Besides, he so transforms those\nphantasms, which he substitutes instead of the hypostases, that he\nhesitates not to imagine new accidents or properties in God. But the most\nexecrable blasphemy of all is, his promiscuous confusion of the Son of God\nand the Spirit with all the creatures. For he asserts that in the Divine\nessence there are parts and divisions, every portion of which is God; and\nespecially that the souls of the faithful are coëternal and consubstantial\nwith God; though in another place he assigns substantial Deity, not only\nto the human soul, but to all created things.\nXXIII. From the same corrupt source has proceeded another heresy, equally\nmonstrous. For some worthless men, to escape the odium and disgrace which\nattended the impious tenets of Servetus, have confessed, indeed, that\nthere are three Persons, but with this explanation, that the Father, who\nalone is truly and properly God, hath created the Son and Spirit, and\ntransfused his Deity into them. Nor do they refrain from this dreadful\nmanner of expressing themselves, that the Father is distinguished from the\nSon and Spirit, as being the sole possessor of the Divine essence. Their\nfirst plea in support of this notion is, that Christ is commonly called\nthe Son of God; whence they conclude that no other is properly God but the\nFather. But they observe not, that although the name of God is common also\nto the Son, yet that it is sometimes ascribed to the Father (κατ᾽ ἐξοχην)\nby way of eminence, because he is the fountain and original of the Deity;\nand this in order to denote the simple unity of the essence. They object,\nthat if he is truly the Son of God, it is absurd to account him the Son of\na Person. I reply, that both are true; that he is the Son of God, because\nhe is the Word begotten of the Father before time began, for we are not\nyet speaking of the Person of the Mediator; and to be explicit, we must\nnotice the Person, that the name of God may not be understood absolutely,\nbut for the Father; for if we acknowledge no other to be God than the\nFather, it will be a manifest degradation of the dignity of the Son.\nWhenever mention is made of the Deity, therefore, there must no opposition\nbe admitted between the Father and the Son, as though the name of the true\nGod belonged exclusively to the Father. For surely the God who appeared to\nIsaiah, was the only true God;(268) whom, nevertheless, John affirms to\nhave been Christ.(269) He likewise, who by the mouth of Isaiah declared\nthat he was to be a rock of offence to the Jews, was the only true\nGod;(270) whom Paul pronounces to have been Christ.(271) He who proclaims\nby Isaiah, “As I live, every knee shall bow to me,”(272) is the only true\nGod; but Paul applies the same to Christ.(273) To the same purpose are the\ntestimonies recited by the Apostle—“Thou, Lord, hast laid the foundation\nof the earth and the heavens;” and “Let all the angels of God worship\nhim.”(274) These ascriptions belong only to the one true God; whereas he\ncontends that they are properly applied to Christ. Nor is there any force\nin that cavil, that what is proper to God is transferred to Christ,\nbecause he is the brightness of his glory. For, since the name Jehovah is\nused in each of these passages, it follows that in respect of his Deity he\nis self‐existent. For, if he is Jehovah, he cannot be denied to be the\nsame God, who in another place proclaims by Isaiah, “I am the first and I\nam the last; and beside me there is no God.”(275) That passage in Jeremiah\nalso deserves our attention—“The gods that have not made the heavens and\nthe earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these\nheavens;”(276) whilst, on the contrary, it must be acknowledged, that the\nDeity of the Son of God is frequently proved by Isaiah from the creation\nof the world. But how shall the Creator, who gives existence to all, not\nbe self‐existent, but derive his essence from another? For whoever asserts\nthat the Son owes his essence to the Father, denies him to be self‐\nexistent. But this is contradicted by the Holy Spirit, who gives him the\nname of Jehovah. Now, if we admit the whole essence to be solely in the\nFather, either it will be divisible, or it will be taken away from the\nSon; and so, being despoiled of his essence, he will be only a titular\ngod. The Divine essence, according to these triflers, belongs solely to\nthe Father, inasmuch as he alone possesses it, and is the author of the\nessence of the Son. Thus the Divinity of the Son will be a kind of\nemanation from the essence of God, or a derivation of a part from the\nwhole. Now, they must of necessity concede, from their own premises, that\nthe Spirit is the Spirit of the Father only; because if he be a derivation\nfrom the original essence, which belongs exclusively to the Father, he\ncannot be accounted the Spirit of the Son; which is refuted by the\ntestimony of Paul, where he makes him common to Christ and the Father.\nBesides, if the Person of the Father be expunged from the Trinity, wherein\nwill he differ from the Son and Spirit, but in being himself the sole\nDeity? They confess that Christ is God, and yet differs from the Father.\nSome distinctive character is necessary, also, to discriminate the Father\nfrom the Son. They who place this in the essence, manifestly destroy the\ntrue Deity of Christ, which cannot exist independently of the essence,\nthat is, of the entire essence. The Father certainly cannot differ from\nthe Son, unless he have something peculiar to himself, which is not common\nto the Son. What will they find, by which to distinguish him? If the\ndifference be in the essence, let them tell us whether he has communicated\nthe same to the Son. But this could not be done partially; for it would be\nan abomination to fabricate a demigod. Besides, this would miserably\ndismember the Divine essence. The necessary conclusion then is, that it is\nentirely and perfectly common to the Father and the Son. And if this be\ntrue, there cannot, in respect of the essence, be any difference between\nthem. If it be objected that the Father, notwithstanding this\ncommunication of his essence, remains the only God with whom the essence\ncontinues, then Christ must be a figurative god, a god in appearance and\nname only, not in reality; because nothing is more proper to God than to\nbe, according to that declaration, “I AM hath sent me unto you.”(277)\nXXIV. We might readily prove from many passages the falsehood of their\nassumption, that, whenever the name of God is mentioned absolutely in the\nScripture, it means only the Father. And in those places which they cite\nin their own defence, they shamefully betray their ignorance, since the\nSon is there added; from which it appears, that the name of God is used in\na relative sense, and therefore is particularly restricted to the Person\nof the Father. Their objection, that, unless the Father alone were the\ntrue God, he would himself be his own Father, is answered in a word. For\nthere is no absurdity in the name of God, for the sake of dignity and\norder, being peculiarly given to him, who not only hath begotten of\nhimself his own wisdom, but is also the God of the Mediator, of which I\nshall treat more at large in its proper place. For since Christ was\nmanifested in the flesh, he is called the Son of God, not only as he was\nthe eternal Word begotten of the Father before time began, but because he\nassumed the person and office of a Mediator, to unite us to God. And since\nthey so presumptuously exclude the Son from Divine honours, I would wish\nto be informed, when he declares that there is none good but the one\nGod,(278) whether he deprives himself of all goodness. I speak not of his\nhuman nature, lest they should object, that, whatever goodness it had, it\nwas gratuitously conferred on it. I demand whether the eternal Word of God\nbe good or not. If they answer in the negative, they are sufficiently\nconvicted of impiety; and if in the affirmative, they cut the throat of\ntheir own system. But though, at the first glance, Christ seems to deny\nhimself the appellation of good, he furnishes, notwithstanding, a further\nconfirmation of our opinion. For, as that is a title which peculiarly\nbelongs to the one God, forasmuch as he had been saluted as good, merely\naccording to a common custom, by his rejection of false honour, he\nsuggested that the goodness which he possessed was Divine. I demand, also,\nwhen Paul affirms that God alone is immortal, wise, and true,(279) whether\nhe thereby degrades Christ to the rank of those who are mortal, unwise,\nand false. Shall not he then be immortal who from the beginning was life\nitself, and the giver of immortality to angels? Shall not he be wise who\nis the eternal Wisdom of God? Shall not he be true who is truth itself? I\ndemand further, whether they think that Christ ought to be worshipped.\nFor, if he justly claims this as his right, that every knee should bow\nbefore him,(280) it follows that he is that God, who, in the law,\nprohibited the worship of any one but himself. If they will have this\npassage in Isaiah, “I am, and there is no God besides me,” to be\nunderstood solely of the Father, I retort this testimony on themselves;\nsince we see that whatever belongs to God is attributed to Christ. Nor is\nthere any room for their cavil, that Christ was exalted in the humanity in\nwhich he had been abased; and that, with regard to his humanity, all power\nwas given to him in heaven and in earth; because, although the regal and\njudicial majesty extends to the whole Person of the Mediator, yet, had he\nnot been God manifested in the flesh, he could not have been exalted to\nsuch an eminence, without God being in opposition to himself. And Paul\nexcellently determines this controversy, by informing us that he was equal\nwith God, before he abased himself under the form of a servant.(281) Now,\nhow could this equality subsist, unless he had been that God whose name is\nJAH and JEHOVAH, who rides on the cherubim, whose kingdom is universal and\neverlasting? No clamour of theirs can deprive Christ of another\ndeclaration of Isaiah: “Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him;”(282)\nsince in these words he describes the advent of God the Redeemer, not only\nfor the deliverance of the people from exile in Babylon, but also for the\ncomplete restoration of the church. Nor do they gain any thing by another\ncavil, that Christ was God in his Father. For although we confess, in\npoint of order and degree, that the Father is the fountain of the Deity,\nyet we pronounce it a detestable figment, that the essence belongs\nexclusively to the Father, as though he were the author of the Deity of\nthe Son; because, on this supposition, either the essence would be\ndivided, or Christ would be only a titular and imaginary god. If they\nadmit that the Son is God, but inferior to the Father, then in him the\nessence must be begotten and created, which in the Father is unbegotten\nand uncreated. I know that some scorners ridicule our concluding a\ndistinction of Persons from the words of Moses, where he introduces God\nthus speaking: “Let us make man in our image.”(283) Yet pious readers\nperceive how frigidly and foolishly Moses would have introduced this\nconference, if in one God there had not subsisted a plurality of Persons.\nNow, it is certain that they whom the Father addressed, were uncreated;\nbut there is nothing uncreated, except the one God himself. Now,\ntherefore, unless they grant that the power to create, and the authority\nto command, were common to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, it will\nfollow, that God did not speak thus within himself, but directed his\nconversation to some exterior agents. Lastly, one place will easily remove\ntheir two objections at once. For when Christ himself declares, that God\nis a Spirit, it would be unreasonable to restrict this solely to the\nFather, as though the Word were not also of a spiritual nature. But if the\nname of Spirit is equally as applicable to the Son as to the Father, I\nconclude that the Son is comprehended under the indefinite name of God.\nYet he immediately subjoins, that none are approved worshippers of the\nFather, but those who worship him in spirit and in truth.(284) Whence\nfollows another consequence, that, because Christ performs the office of a\nTeacher, in a station of inferiority, he ascribes the name of God to the\nFather, not to destroy his own Deity, but by degrees to raise us to the\nknowledge of it.\nXXV. But they deceive themselves in dreaming of three separate\nindividuals, each of them possessing a part of the Divine essence. We\nteach, according to the Scriptures, that there is essentially but one God;\nand, therefore, that the essence of both the Son and the Spirit is\nunbegotten. But since the Father is first in order, and hath of himself\nbegotten his wisdom, therefore, as has before been observed, he is justly\nesteemed the original and fountain of the whole Divinity. Thus God,\nindefinitely, is unbegotten; and the Father also is unbegotten with regard\nto his Person. They even foolishly suppose, that our opinion implies a\nquaternity; whereas they are guilty of falsehood and calumny, in ascribing\nto us a figment of their own; as though we pretended that the three\nPersons are as so many streams proceeding from one essence, when it is\nevident, from our writings, that we separate not the Persons from the\nessence, but, though they subsist in it, make a distinction between them.\nIf the persons were separated from the essence, there would perhaps be\nsome probability in their argument; but then there would be a trinity of\nGods, not a trinity of persons contained in one God. This solves their\nfrivolous question, whether the essence concurs to the formation of the\nTrinity; as though we imagined three Gods to descend from it. Their\nobjection, that then the Trinity would be without God, is equally\nimpertinent. Because, though it concurs not to the distinction as a part\nor member, yet the Persons are not independent of it, nor separate from\nit; for the Father, unless he were God, could not be the Father; and the\nSon is the Son only as he is God. Therefore we say, that the Deity is\nabsolutely self‐existent; whence we confess, also, that the Son, as God,\nindependently of the consideration of Person, is self‐existent; but as the\nSon, we say, that he is of the Father. Thus his essence is unoriginated;\nbut the origin of his Person is God himself. And, indeed, the orthodox\nwriters, who have written on the Trinity, have referred this name only to\nthe Persons; since to comprehend the essence in that distinction, were not\nonly an absurd error, but a most gross impiety. For it is evident that\nthose who maintain that the Trinity consists in a union of the Essence,\nthe Son, and the Spirit, annihilate the essence of the Son and of the\nSpirit; otherwise the parts would be destroyed by being confounded\ntogether; which is a fault in every distinction. Finally, if the words\n_Father_ and _God_ were synonymous—if the Father were the author of the\nDeity—nothing would be left in the Son but a mere shadow; nor would the\nTrinity be any other than a conjunction of the one God with two created\nthings.\nXXVI. Their objection, that Christ, if he be properly God, is not rightly\ncalled the Son of God, has already been answered; for when a comparison is\nmade between one Person and another, the word _God_ is not used\nindefinitely, but is restricted to the Father, as being the fountain of\nthe Deity, not with regard to the essence, as fanatics falsely pretend,\nbut in respect of order. This is the sense in which we ought to understand\nthat declaration of Christ to his Father: “This is life eternal, that they\nmight know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast\nsent.”(285) For, speaking in the capacity of Mediator, he holds an\nintermediate station between God and men; yet without any diminution of\nhis majesty. For, although he abased himself, yet he lost not his glory\nwith the Father, which was hidden from the world. Thus the Apostle to the\nHebrews,(286) though he acknowledges that Christ was made for a short time\ninferior to the angels, yet, nevertheless, hesitates not to assert, that\nhe is the eternal God, who laid the foundation of the earth. We must\nremember, therefore, that whenever Christ, in the capacity of Mediator,\naddresses the Father, he comprehends, under the name of God, the Divinity\nwhich belongs also to himself. Thus, when he said to his Apostles, “I go\nunto the Father, for my Father is greater than I,”(287) he attributes not\nto himself a secondary Divinity, as if he were inferior to the Father with\nrespect to the eternal essence, but because, having obtained the glory of\nheaven, he gathers together the faithful to a participation of it with\nhim; he represents the Father to be in a station superior to himself, just\nas the illustrious perfection of the splendour which appears in heaven\nexcels that degree of glory which was visible in him during his incarnate\nstate. For the same reason, Paul says, in another place, that Christ\n“shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, that God may be all\nin all.”(288) Nothing would be more absurd than to deny perpetual duration\nto the Deity of Christ. Now, if he will never cease to be the Son of God,\nbut will remain for ever the same as he has been from the beginning, it\nfollows, that by the name _Father_ is intended the one sole Divine\nessence, which is common to them both. And it is certain that Christ\ndescended to us, in order that, exalting us to the Father, he might at the\nsame time exalt us to himself also, as being one with the Father. It is\ntherefore neither lawful nor right to restrict the name of God exclusively\nto the Father, and to deny it to the Son. For even on this very account\nJohn asserts him to be the true God,(289) that no one might suppose, that\nhe possessed only a secondary degree of Deity, inferior to the Father. And\nI wonder what can be the meaning of these fabricators of new gods, when,\nafter confessing that Christ is the true God, they immediately exclude him\nfrom the Deity of the Father; as though there could be any true God but\none alone, or as though a transfused Divinity were any thing but a novel\nfiction.\nXXVII. Their accumulation of numerous passages from Irenæus, where he\nasserts the Father of Christ to be the only and eternal God of Israel, is\na proof either of shameful ignorance, or of consummate wickedness. For\nthey ought to have considered, that that holy man was then engaged in a\ncontroversy with some madmen, who denied that the Father of Christ was the\nsame God that has spoken by Moses and the Prophets, but maintained that he\nwas I know not what sort of phantasm, produced from the corruption of the\nworld. His only object, therefore, is to show that no other God is\nrevealed in the Scripture than the Father of Christ, and that it is\nimpious to imagine any other; and therefore we need not wonder at his\nfrequently concluding, that there never was any other God of Israel than\nhe who was preached by Christ and his Apostles. So, now, on the other\nhand, when a different error is to be opposed, we shall truly assert, that\nthe God who appeared formerly to the patriarchs, was no other than Christ.\nIf it be objected that it was the Father, we are prepared to reply, that,\nwhile we contend for the Divinity of the Son, we by no means reject that\nof the Father. If the reader attends to this design of Irenæus, all\ncontention will cease. Moreover, the whole controversy is easily decided\nby the sixth chapter of the third book, where the good man insists on this\none point: That he who is absolutely and indefinitely called God in the\nScripture, is the only true God; but that the name of God is given\nabsolutely to Christ. Let us remember that the point at issue, as appears\nfrom the whole treatise, and particularly from the forty‐sixth chapter of\nthe second book, was this: That the appellation of Father is not given in\nan enigmatical and parabolical sense to one who is not truly God. Besides,\nin another place he contends, that the Son is called God, as well as the\nFather, by the Prophets and Apostles. He afterwards states how Christ, who\nis Lord, and King, and God, and Judge of all, received power from him who\nis God of all; and that is with relation to the subjection in which he was\nhumbled even to the death of the cross. And a little after he affirms,\nthat the Son is the Creator of heaven and earth, who gave the law by the\nhand of Moses, and appeared to the patriarchs. Now, if any one pretends\nthat Irenæus acknowledges the Father alone as the God of Israel, I shall\nreply, as is clearly maintained by the same writer, that Christ is one and\nthe same; as also he applies to him the prophecy of Habakkuk: “God shall\ncome from the south.” To the same purpose is what we find in the ninth\nchapter of the fourth book: “Therefore Christ himself is, with the Father,\nthe God of the living.” And in the twelfth chapter of the same book he\nstates, that Abraham believed in God, inasmuch as Christ is the Creator of\nheaven and earth, and the only God.\nXXVIII. Their pretensions to the sanction of Tertullian are equally\nunfounded, for, notwithstanding the occasional harshness and obscurity of\nhis mode of expression, yet he unequivocally teaches the substance of the\ndoctrine which we are defending; that is, that whereas there is one God,\nyet by dispensation or economy there is his Word; that there is but one\nGod in the unity of the substance, but that the unity, by a mysterious\ndispensation, is disposed into a trinity; that there are three, not in\ncondition, but in degree; not in substance, but in form; not in power, but\nin order. He says, indeed, that he maintains the Son to be second to the\nFather; but he applies this only to the distinction of the Persons. He\nsays somewhere, that the Son is visible; but after having stated arguments\non both sides, he concludes that, as the Word, he is invisible. Lastly,\nhis assertion that the Father is designated by his Person, proves him to\nbe at the greatest distance from the notion which we are refuting. And\nthough he acknowledges no other God than the Father, yet the explanations\nwhich he gives in the immediate context show that he speaks not to the\nexclusion of the Son, when he denies the existence of any other God than\nthe Father; and that therefore the unity of Divine government is not\nviolated by the distinction of persons. And from the nature and design of\nhis argument it is easy to gather the meaning of his words. For he\ncontends, in opposition to Praxeas, that although God is distinguished\ninto three Persons, yet neither is there a plurality of gods, nor is the\nunity divided. And because, according to the erroneous notion of Praxeas,\nChrist could not be God, without being the Father, therefore Tertullian\nbestows so much labour upon the distinction. His calling the Word and\nSpirit a portion of the whole, though a harsh expression, yet is\nexcusable; since it has no reference to the substance, but only denotes\nthe disposition and economy, which belongs solely to the Persons,\naccording to the testimony of Tertullian himself. Hence also that\nquestion, “How many Persons suppose you that there are, O most perverse\nPraxeas, but as many as there are names?” So, a little after, “that they\nmay believe the Father and the Son, both in their names and Persons.”\nThese arguments, I conceive, will suffice to refute the impudence of those\nwho make use of the authority of Tertullian in order to deceive the minds\nof the simple.\nXXIX. And certainly, whoever will diligently compare the writings of the\nfathers, will find in Irenæus nothing different from what was advanced by\nothers who succeeded him. Justin Martyr is one of the most ancient; and he\nagrees with us in every point. They may object that the Father of Christ\nis denominated the one God by him as well as by the rest. The same is\nasserted also by Hilary, and even in harsher terms: he says, that eternity\nis in the Father; but does this imply a denial of the Divine essence to\nthe Son? On the contrary, he had no other design than to maintain the same\nfaith which we hold. Nevertheless, they are not ashamed to cull out\nmutilated passages, in order to induce a belief that he patronized their\nerror. If they wish any authority to be attached to their quotation of\nIgnatius, let them prove that the Apostles delivered any law concerning\nLent, and similar corruptions; for nothing can be more absurd than the\nimpertinencies which have been published under the name of Ignatius.\nWherefore their impudence is more intolerable, who disguise themselves\nunder such false colours for the purpose of deception. Moreover, the\nconsent of antiquity manifestly appears from this circumstance, that in\nthe Nicene Council, Arius never dared to defend himself by the authority\nof any approved writer; and not one of the Greek or Latin fathers, who\nwere there united against him, excused himself as at all dissenting from\nhis predecessors. With regard to Augustine, who experienced great\nhostility from these disturbers, his diligent examination of all the\nwritings of the earlier fathers, and his respectful attention to them,\nneed not be mentioned. If he differs from them in the smallest\nparticulars, he assigns the reasons which oblige him to dissent from them.\nOn this argument also, if he finds any thing ambiguous or obscure in\nothers, he never conceals it. Yet he takes it for granted, that the\ndoctrine which those men oppose has been received without controversy from\nthe remotest antiquity; and yet that he was not uninformed of what others\nhad taught before him, appears even from one word in the first book of his\nTreatise on the Christian Doctrine, where he says, that unity is in the\nFather. Will they pretend that he had then forgotten himself? But he\nelsewhere vindicates himself from this calumny, where he calls the Father\nthe fountain of the whole Deity, because he is from no other; wisely\nconsidering that the name of God is especially ascribed to the Father,\nbecause, unless the original be from him, it is impossible to conceive of\nthe simple unity of the Deity. These observations, I hope, will be\napproved by the pious reader, as sufficient to refute all the calumnies,\nwith which Satan has hitherto laboured to pervert or obscure the purity of\nthis doctrine. Finally, I trust that the whole substance of this doctrine\nhas been faithfully stated and explained, provided my readers set bounds\nto their curiosity, and are not unreasonably fond of tedious and intricate\ncontroversies. For I have not the least expectation of giving satisfaction\nto those who are pleased with an intemperance of speculation. I am sure I\nhave used no artifice in the omission of any thing, from a supposition\nthat it would make against me. But, studying the edification of the\nChurch, I have thought it better not to touch upon many things, which\nwould be unnecessarily burdensome to the reader, without yielding him any\nprofit. For to what purpose is it to dispute, whether the Father be always\nbegetting? For it is foolish to imagine a continual act of generation,\nsince it is evident that three Persons have subsisted in God from all\neternity."

          "title": "Chapter XIV. The True God Clearly Distinguished In The Scripture From All",
          "content": "Fictitious Ones By The Creation Of The World.\nAlthough Isaiah(290) brings a just accusation of stupidity against the\nworshippers of fictitious deities, for not having learned, from the\nfoundations of the earth, and the circuit of the heavens, who was the true\nGod, yet such is the slowness and dulness of our minds, as to induce a\nnecessity for a more express exhibition of the true God, lest the faithful\nshould decline to the fictions of the heathen. For, since the most\ntolerable description given by the philosophers, that God is the soul of\nthe world, is utterly vain and worthless, we require a more familiar\nknowledge of him, to prevent us from wavering in perpetual uncertainty.\nTherefore he hath been pleased to give us a history of the creation, on\nwhich the faith of the Church might rest, without seeking after any other\nGod than him whom Moses has represented as the former and builder of the\nworld. The first thing specified in this history is the time, that by a\ncontinued series of years the faithful might arrive at the first original\nof the human race, and of all things. This knowledge is eminently useful,\nnot only to contradict the monstrous fables formerly received in Egypt and\nother countries, but also to give us clearer views of the eternity of God,\nand to fill us with greater admiration of it. Nor ought we to be moved\nwith that profane sneer, that it is marvellous that God did not form the\ndesign of creating heaven and earth at an earlier period, but suffered an\nimmeasurable duration to pass away unemployed, since he could have made\nthem many thousands of ages before; whereas the continuance of the world,\nnow advancing to its last end, has not yet reached six thousand years. For\nthe reason why God deferred it so long, it would be neither lawful nor\nexpedient to inquire; because, if the human mind strive to penetrate it,\nit will fail a hundred times in the attempt; nor, indeed, could there be\nany utility in the knowledge of that which God himself, in order to prove\nthe modesty of our faith, has purposely concealed. Great shrewdness was\ndiscovered by a certain pious old man, who, when some scoffer ludicrously\ninquired what God had been doing before the creation of the world, replied\nthat he had been making hell for over curious men. This admonition, no\nless grave than severe, should repress the wantonness which stimulates\nmany, and impels them to perverse and injurious speculations. Lastly, let\nus remember that God, who is invisible, and whose wisdom, power, and\njustice, are incomprehensible, has placed before us the history of Moses,\nas a mirror which exhibits his lively image. For as eyes, either dim\nthrough age, or dull through any disease, see nothing distinctly without\nthe assistance of spectacles, so, in our inquiries after God, such is our\nimbecility, without the guidance of the Scripture we immediately lose our\nway. But those who indulge their presumption, since they are now\nadmonished in vain, will perceive too late, by their horrible destruction,\nhow much better it would have been to look up to the secret counsels of\nGod with reverential awe, than to disgorge their blasphemies to darken the\nheaven. Augustine justly complains, that it is an offence against God, to\ninquire for any cause of things, higher than his will. He elsewhere\nprudently cautions us, that it is as absurd to dispute concerning an\ninfinite duration of time, as concerning an infinite extent of place.\nHowever extensive the circuit of the heavens, yet certainly it has some\ndimensions. Now, if any one should expostulate with God, that the vacuity\nof space is a hundred times larger, would not such arrogance be detested\nby all pious persons? The same madness is chargeable on those who censure\nthe inaction of God, for not having, according to their wishes, created\nthe world innumerable ages before. To gratify their inordinate curiosity,\nthey desire to pass beyond the limits of the world; as though, in the very\nample circumference of heaven and earth, we were not surrounded by\nnumerous objects capable of absorbing all our senses in their inestimable\nsplendour; as though, in the course of six thousand years, God had not\ngiven us lessons sufficient to exercise our minds in assiduous meditation\non them. Then let us cheerfully remain within these barriers with which\nGod has been pleased to circumscribe us, and as it were to confine our\nminds, that they might not be wandering in the boundless regions of\nuncertain conjecture.\nII. To the same purpose is the narration of Moses, that the work of God\nwas completed, not in one moment, but in six days. For by this\ncircumstance also we are called away from all false deities to the only\ntrue God, who distributed his work into six days, that it might not be\ntedious to us to occupy the whole of life in the consideration of it. For\nthough, whithersoever we turn our eyes, they are constrained to behold the\nworks of God, yet we see how transient our attention is, and, if we are\ntouched with any pious reflections, how soon they leave us again. Here,\nalso, human reason murmurs, as though such progressive works were\ninconsistent with the power of Deity; till, subdued to the obedience of\nfaith, it learns to observe that rest, to which the sanctification of the\nseventh day invites us. Now, in the order of those things, we must\ndiligently consider the paternal love of God towards the human race, in\nnot creating Adam before he had enriched the earth with an abundant supply\nof every thing conducive to his happiness. For had he placed him in the\nearth while it remained barren and vacant, had he given him life before\nthere was any light, he would have appeared not very attentive to his\nbenefit. Now, when he has regulated the motions of the sun and the stars\nfor the service of man, replenished the earth, the air, and the waters,\nwith living creatures, and caused the earth to produce an abundance of all\nkinds of fruits sufficient for sustenance, he acts the part of a provident\nand sedulous father of a family, and displays his wonderful goodness\ntowards us. If the reader will more attentively consider with himself\nthese things, which I only hint at as I proceed, he will be convinced that\nMoses was an authentic witness and herald of the one God, the Creator of\nthe world. I pass over what I have already stated, that he not only speaks\nof the mere essence of God, but also exhibits to us his eternal Wisdom and\nhis Spirit, in order that we may not dream of any other God except him who\nwill be known in that express image.\nIII. But before I begin to enlarge on the nature of man, something must be\nsaid concerning angels. Because, though Moses, in the history of the\ncreation, accommodating himself to the ignorance of the common people,\nmentions no other works of God than such as are visible to our eyes, yet,\nwhen he afterwards introduces angels as ministers of God, we may easily\nconclude, that he is their Creator, whom they obey, and in whose service\nthey are employed. Though Moses, therefore, speaking in a popular manner,\ndoes not, in the beginning of his writings, immediately enumerate the\nangels among the creatures of God, yet nothing forbids our here making a\nplain and explicit statement of those things which the Scripture teaches\nin other places; because, if we desire to know God from his works, such an\nexcellent and noble specimen should by no means be omitted. Besides, this\npoint of doctrine is very necessary for the confutation of many errors.\nThe excellence of the angelic nature has so dazzled the minds of many,\nthat they have supposed them to be injured, if they were treated as mere\ncreatures, subject to the government of one God. Hence they were falsely\npretended to possess a kind of divinity. Manichæus has also arisen, with\nthe sect which he founded, who imagined to himself two original\nprinciples, God and the devil; and attributed to God the origin of all\ngood things, but referred evil natures to the production of the devil. If\nour minds were bewildered in this wild and incoherent system, we should\nnot leave God in full possession of his glory in the creation of the\nworld. For, since nothing is more peculiar to God than eternity and self‐\nexistence, does not the ascription of this to the devil dignify him with a\ntitle of Divinity? Now, where is the omnipotence of God, if such an empire\nbe conceded to the devil, as that he can execute whatever he pleases,\nnotwithstanding the aversion of the Divine will, or opposition of the\nDivine power? But the only foundation of the system of Manichæus, that it\nis unlawful to ascribe to a good God the creation of any evil thing, in no\nrespect affects the orthodox faith, which admits not that any thing in the\nuniverse is evil in its nature; since neither the depravity and wickedness\nof men and devils, nor the sins which proceed from that source, are from\nmere nature, but from a corruption of nature; nor from the beginning has\nany thing existed, in which God has not given a specimen both of his\nwisdom and of his justice. To oppose these perverse notions, it is\nnecessary to raise our minds higher than our eyes can reach. And it is\nvery probable that it was with this design, when, in the Nicene creed, God\nis called the Creator of all things, that particular mention is made of\nthings invisible. Yet it shall be my study to observe the limit which the\nrule of piety prescribes, lest, by indulging an unprofitable degree of\nspeculation, I should lead the reader astray from the simplicity of the\nfaith. And certainly, since the Spirit invariably teaches us in a\nprofitable manner, but, with regard to things of little importance to\nedification, either is wholly silent, or but lightly and cursorily touches\non them,—it is also our duty cheerfully to remain in ignorance of what it\nis not for our advantage to know.\nIV. Since angels are ministers of God appointed to execute his\ncommands,(291) that they are also his creatures, ought to be admitted\nwithout controversy. And does it not betray obstinacy rather than\ndiligence, to raise any contention concerning the time or the order in\nwhich they were created? Moses narrates, that “the heavens and the earth\nwere finished, and all the host of them:”(292) to what purpose is it\nanxiously to inquire, on what day, besides the stars and the planets, the\nother more concealed hosts of heaven began to exist? Not to be too prolix,\nlet us remember on this point (as on the whole doctrine of religion) to\nobserve one rule of modesty and sobriety; which is, not to speak, or\nthink, or even desire to know, concerning obscure subjects, any thing\nbeyond the information given us in the Divine word. Another rule to be\nfollowed is, in reading the Scripture, continually to direct our attention\nto investigate and meditate upon things conducive to edification; not to\nindulge curiosity or the study of things unprofitable. And, since the Lord\nhas been pleased to instruct us, not in frivolous questions, but in solid\npiety, the fear of his name, true confidence, and the duties of holiness,\nlet us content ourselves with that knowledge. Wherefore, if we wish to be\ntruly wise, we must forsake the vain imaginations propagated by triflers\nconcerning the nature, orders, and multitude of angels. I know that these\nthings are embraced by many persons with greater avidity, and dwelt upon\nwith more pleasure, than such things as are in daily use. But, if it be\nnot irksome to be the disciples of Christ, it should not be irksome to\nfollow that method which he has prescribed. Then the consequence will be,\nthat, content with his discipline, we shall not only leave, but also\nabhor, those unprofitable speculations from which he calls us away. No man\ncan deny that great subtlety and acuteness is discovered by Dionysius,\nwhoever he was, in many parts of his treatise on the Celestial Hierarchy;\nbut, if any one enters into a critical examination of it, he will find the\ngreatest part of it to be mere babbling. But the duty of a theologian is,\nnot to please the ear with empty sounds, but to confirm the conscience by\nteaching things which are true, certain, and profitable. A reader of that\nbook would suppose that the author was a man descended from heaven, giving\nan account of things that he had not learned from the information of\nothers, but had seen with his own eyes. But Paul, who was “caught up to\nthe third heaven,”(293) not only has told us no such things, but has even\ndeclared, that it is not lawful for men to utter the secret things which\nhe had seen. Taking our leave, therefore, of this nugatory wisdom, let us\nconsider, from the simple doctrine of the Scripture, what the Lord has\nbeen pleased for us to know concerning his angels.\nV. We are frequently informed in the Scripture, that angels are celestial\nspirits, whose ministry and service God uses for the execution of whatever\nhe has decreed; and hence this name is given to them, because God employs\nthem as messengers to manifest himself to men. Other appellations also, by\nwhich they are distinguished, are derived from a similar cause. They are\ncalled Hosts, because, as life‐guards, they surround their prince,\naggrandizing his majesty, and rendering it conspicuous; and, like\nsoldiers, are ever attentive to the signal of their leader; and are so\nprepared for the performance of his commands, that he has no sooner\nsignified his will than they are ready for the work, or rather are\nactually engaged in it. Such a representation of the throne of God is\nexhibited in the magnificent descriptions of the Prophets, but\nparticularly of Daniel; where he says, when God had ascended the judgment‐\nseat, that “thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times\nten thousand stood before him.”(294) Since by their means the Lord\nwonderfully exerts and declares the power and strength of his hand, thence\nthey are denominated Powers.(295) Because by them he exercises and\nadministers his government in the world, therefore they are called\nsometimes Principalities, sometimes Powers, sometimes Dominions. Lastly,\nbecause the glory of God in some measure resides in them, they have also,\nfor this reason, the appellation of Thrones;(296) although on this last\nname I would affirm nothing, because a different interpretation is equally\nor even more suitable. But, omitting this name, the Holy Spirit often uses\nthe former ones, to magnify the dignity of the angelic ministry. Nor,\nindeed, is it right that no honour should be paid to those instruments, by\nwhom God particularly exhibits the presence of his power. Moreover, they\nare more than once called gods; because in their ministry, as in a mirror,\nthey give us an imperfect representation of Divinity. Though I am pleased\nwith the interpretation of the old writers, on those passages where the\nScripture records the appearance of an angel of God to Abraham, Jacob,\nMoses, and others,(297) that Christ was that angel, yet frequently, where\nmention is made of angels in general, this name is given to them. Nor\nshould this surprise us; for, if that honour be given to princes and\ngovernors, because, in the performance of their functions, they are\nvicegerents of God, the supreme King and Judge,(298) there is far greater\nreason for its being paid to angels, in whom the splendour of the Divine\nglory is far more abundantly displayed.\nVI. But the Scripture principally insists on what might conduce most to\nour consolation, and the confirmation of our faith—that the angels are the\ndispensers and administrators of the Divine beneficence towards us; and\ntherefore it informs us, that they guard our safety, undertake our\ndefence, direct our ways, and exercise a constant solicitude that no evil\nbefall us. The declarations are universal, belonging primarily to Christ\nthe head of the Church, and then to all the faithful: “He shall give his\nangels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear\nthee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.”(299)\nAgain, “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him,\nand delivereth them.”(300) In these passages God shows that he delegates\nto his angels the protection of those whom he has undertaken to preserve.\nAccordingly, the angel of the Lord consoles the fugitive Hagar, and\ncommands her to be reconciled to her mistress.(301) Abraham promises his\nservant that an angel should be the guide of his journey.(302) Jacob, in\nhis benediction of Ephraim and Manasseh, prays that the angel of the Lord,\nby whom he had been redeemed from all evil, would cause them to\nprosper.(303) Thus an angel was appointed to protect the camp of the\nIsraelites;(304) and whenever it pleased God to deliver them from the\nhands of their enemies, he raised up avengers by the ministry of\nangels.(305) And finally, to supersede the necessity of adducing more\nexamples, angels ministered to Christ and attended him in all his\ndifficulties; they announced his resurrection to the women, and his\nglorious advent to the disciples.(306) And thus, in the discharge of their\noffice as our protectors, they contend against the devil and all our\nenemies, and execute the vengeance of God on those who molest us; as we\nread that an angel of God, to deliver Jerusalem from a siege, slew a\nhundred and eighty‐five thousand men in the camp of the king of Assyria in\none night.(307)\nVII. But whether each of the faithful has a particular angel assigned him\nfor his defence, I cannot venture certainly to affirm. When Daniel\nintroduces the angel of the Persians and the angel of the Greeks,(308) he\nclearly signifies that certain angels are appointed to preside over\nkingdoms and provinces. Christ also, when he says that the angels of\nchildren always behold the face of the Father,(309) suggests, that there\nare certain angels who are charged with their safety. But I know not\nwhether this justifies the conclusion, that every one of them has his\nparticular guardian angel. Of this, indeed, we may be certain, that not\none angel only has the care of every one of us, but that they all with one\nconsent watch for our salvation. For it is said of all the angels\ntogether, that they rejoice more over one sinner turned to repentance,\nthan over ninety and nine just persons who have persevered in their\nrighteousness.(310) Of more than one angel it is said, that they carried\nthe soul of Lazarus into the bosom of Abraham.(311) Nor is it in vain that\nElisha shows his servant so many fiery chariots, which were peculiarly\nassigned to him for his protection.(312) There is one place which seems\nclearer than the rest in confirmation of this point. For when Peter, on\nhis liberation from prison, knocked at the door of the house in which the\nbrethren were assembled, as they could not suppose it to be Peter himself,\nthey said it was his angel.(313) This conclusion seems to have arisen in\ntheir minds from the common opinion that each of the faithful has his\nguardian angel assigned him. But here it may also be replied, that nothing\nprevents this being understood of any one of the angels, to whom the Lord\nmight have committed the care of Peter on that occasion, and who yet might\nnot be his perpetual guardian; as it is vulgarly imagined that every\nperson has two angels, a good one and a bad one, according to the heathen\nnotion of different genii. But it is not worth while anxiously to\ninvestigate what it little concerns us to know. For if any one be not\nsatisfied with this, that all the orders of the celestial army watch for\nhis safety, I see not what advantage he can derive from knowing that he\nhas one particular angel given him for his guardian. But those who\nrestrict to one angel the care which God exercises over every one of us,\ndo a great injury to themselves, and to all the members of the Church; as\nthough those auxiliaries had been promised in vain, who, by surrounding\nand defending us on all sides, contribute to increase our courage in the\nconflict.\nVIII. Let those, who venture to determine concerning the multitude and\norders of the angels, examine on what foundation their opinions rest.\nMichael, I confess, is called in Daniel “the great prince,” and in Jude\n“the archangel.”(314) And Paul informs us that it will be an archangel,\nwho, with the sound of a trumpet, shall summon men to judgment.(315) But\nwho, from these passages, can determine the degrees of honour among the\nangels, distinguish the individuals by their respective titles, and assign\nto every one his place and station? For the two names which are found in\nthe Scripture, Michael and Gabriel, and the third, if you wish to add it\nfrom the history of Tobias,(316) may appear, from their significations, to\nbe given to angels on account of our infirmity; though I would rather\nleave this undetermined. With respect to their numbers, we hear, from the\nmouth of Christ, of many legions;(317) from Daniel, of many myriads:(318)\nthe servant of Elisha saw many chariots; and their being said to encamp\nround about them that fear God,(319) is expressive of a great multitude.\nIt is certain that spirits have no form; and yet the Scripture, on account\nof the slender capacity of our minds, under the names of cherubim and\nseraphim, represents angels to us as having wings, to prevent our doubting\nthat they will always attend, with incredible celerity, to afford us\nassistance as soon as our cases require it; as though the lightning darted\nfrom heaven were to fly to us with its accustomed velocity. All further\ninquiries on both these points, we should consider as belonging to that\nclass of mysteries, the full revelation of which is deferred to the last\nday. Wherefore let us remember that we ought to avoid too much curiosity\nof research, and presumption of language.\nIX. But this, which is called in question by some restless men, must be\nreceived as a certain truth, that angels are ministering spirits, whose\nservice God uses for the protection of his people, and by whom he\ndispenses his benefits among mankind, and executes his other works. It was\nthe opinion of the ancient Sadducees, indeed, that the term _angels_\nsignified nothing but the motions which God inspires into men, or those\nspecimens which he gives of his power. But this foolish notion is\nrepugnant to so many testimonies of Scripture, that it is surprising how\nsuch gross ignorance could have been tolerated among that people. For, to\nomit the places before cited, where mention is made of thousands and\nlegions of angels; where joy is attributed to them; where they are said to\nsustain the faithful in their hands, to carry their souls into rest, to\nbehold the face of the Father,(320) and the like,—there are others which\nmost clearly evince, that they are spirits possessing an actual existence\nand their own peculiar nature. For the declarations of Stephen and\nPaul,—that the law was given by the hand of angels,(321) and of Christ,\nthat the elect, after the resurrection, shall be like angels; that the day\nof judgment is not known even to the angels; that he then will come with\nhis holy angels,(322)—however tortured, must necessarily be thus\nunderstood. Likewise, when Paul charges Timothy, before Christ and the\nelect angels, to keep his precepts,(323) he intends, not unsubstantial\nqualities or inspirations, but real spirits. Nor otherwise is there any\nmeaning in what we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that Christ is made\nmore excellent than the angels, that the world is not subject to them,\nthat Christ assumed not their nature, but the nature of man,(324) unless\nwe understand that there are happy spirits, to whom these comparisons may\napply. And the author of the same epistle explains himself, where he\nplaces angels and the souls of the faithful together in the kingdom of\nGod.(325) Besides, we have already quoted, that the angels of children\nalways behold the face of God; that we are always defended by their\nprotection; that they rejoice for our safety; that they admire the\nmanifold grace of God in the church;(326) and are subject to Christ as\ntheir head.(327) The same truth is proved by their having so often\nappeared to the patriarchs in the form of men, conversed with them, and\nbeen entertained by them. And Christ himself, on account of the\npreëminence which he obtains in the capacity of Mediator, is called an\nangel.(328) I have thought proper cursorily to touch on this point, in\norder to fortify the simple against those foolish and absurd notions,\nwhich were disseminated by Satan many ages ago, and are frequently\nspringing up afresh.\nX. It remains for us to encounter the superstition, which generally\ninsinuates itself into men’s minds when angels are said to be the\nministers and dispensers of all our blessings. For human reason soon falls\ninto an opinion, that there is no honour that ought not to be paid to\nthem. Thus it happens that what belongs solely to God and Christ, is\ntransferred to them. Thus we see, that for some ages past the glory of\nChrist has in many ways been obscured; while angels have been loaded with\nextravagant honours without the authority of the word of God. And among\nthe errors which we combat in the present day, there is scarcely one more\nancient than this. For even Paul appears to have had a great controversy\nwith some, who exalted angels in such a manner as almost to degrade Christ\nto an inferior station. Hence the solicitude with which he maintains, in\nthe Epistle to the Colossians, not only that Christ is to be esteemed\nabove angels, but also that he is the author of all blessings to\nthem,(329) in order that we may not forsake him and turn to them, who are\nnot even sufficient for themselves, but draw from the same fountain as we\ndo. Since the splendour of the Divine majesty, therefore, is eminently\ndisplayed in them, there is nothing more natural than for us to fall down\nwith astonishment in adoration of them, and to attribute every thing to\nthem which exclusively belongs to God. Even John, in the Revelation,\nconfesses this to have happened to himself; but adds at the same time,\nthat he was thus answered: “See thou do it not: I am thy fellow‐servant:\nworship God.”(330)\nXI. But this danger we shall happily avoid, if we consider why God is\naccustomed to provide for the safety of the faithful, and to communicate\nthe gifts of his beneficence by means of angels, rather than by himself to\nmanifest his own power without their intervention. He certainly does this\nnot from necessity, as though he were unable to do without them; for\nwhenever he pleases he passes them by, and performs his work with a mere\nnod of his power; so far is he from being indebted to their assistance for\nrelieving him in any difficulty. This, therefore, conduces to the\nconsolation of our imbecility, that we may want nothing that can either\nraise our minds to a good hope, or confirm them in security. This one\nthing, indeed, ought to be more than sufficient for us, that the Lord\ndeclares himself to be our Protector. But while we see ourselves\nencompassed with so many dangers, so many annoyances, such various kinds\nof enemies,—such is our weakness and frailty, that we may sometimes be\nfilled with terror, or fall into despair, unless the Lord enables us,\naccording to our capacity, to discover the presence of his grace. For this\nreason he promises, not only that he will take care of us himself, but\nalso that we shall have innumerable life‐guards, to whom he has committed\nthe charge of our safety; and that, as long as we are surrounded by their\nsuperintendence and protection, whatever danger may threaten, we are\nplaced beyond the utmost reach of evil. I confess, indeed, that it is\nwrong for us, after that simple promise of the protection of God alone,\nstill to be looking around to see from what quarter our aid may come. But\nsince the Lord, from his infinite clemency and goodness, is pleased to\nassist this our weakness, there is no reason why we should neglect this\ngreat favour which he shows us. We have an example of this in the servant\nof Elisha, who, when he saw that the mountain was besieged by an army of\nSyrians,(331) and that no way of escape was left, was filled with\nconsternation, as though himself and his master had been ruined. Then\nElisha prayed that God would open his eyes, and he immediately saw the\nmountain full of horses and chariots of fire; that is, of a multitude of\nangels who were to guard him and the Prophet. Encouraged by this vision,\nhe came to himself again, and was able to look down with intrepidity on\nthe enemies, the sight of whom before had almost deprived him of life.\nXII. Therefore, whatever is said concerning the ministry of angels, let us\ndirect it to this end, that, overcoming all diffidence, our hope in God\nmay be more firmly established. For the Lord has provided these guards for\nus, that we may not be terrified by a multitude of enemies, as though they\ncould prevail in opposition to his assistance, but may have recourse to\nthe sentiment expressed by Elisha, “There are more for us than against\nus.” How preposterous is it, then, that we should be alienated from God by\nangels, who are appointed for this very purpose, to testify that his aid\nis more especially present with us! But they do alienate us from him,\nunless they lead us directly to him, to regard him, call on him, and\ncelebrate him as our only helper; unless they are considered by us as his\nhands, which apply themselves to do nothing without his direction; unless\nthey attach us to Christ, the only Mediator, to depend entirely on him, to\nlean upon him, to aspire to him, and to rest satisfied in him. For what is\ndescribed in the vision of Jacob(332) ought to be firmly fixed in our\nminds, that the angels descend to the earth to men, and ascend from earth\nto heaven, by a ladder above which stands the Lord of hosts. This implies,\nthat it is only through the intercession of Christ, that we are favoured\nwith the ministry of angels, as he himself affirms: “Hereafter ye shall\nsee heaven open, and the angels descending upon the Son of man.”(333)\nTherefore the servant of Abraham, having been commended to the care of an\nangel,(334) does not therefore invoke him for his aid, but, trusting to\nthat committal, pours out his prayers before the Lord, and entreats him to\ndisplay his mercy towards Abraham. For as God does not make them the\nministers of his power and goodness, in order to divide his glory with\nthem, so neither does he promise his assistance in their ministry, that we\nmay divide our confidence between them and him. Let us take our leave,\ntherefore, of that Platonic philosophy, which seeks access to God by means\nof angels, and worships them in order to render him more propitious to us;\nwhich superstitious and curious men have endeavoured from the beginning,\nand even to this day persevere in attempting, to introduce into our\nreligion.\nXIII. The design of almost every thing that the Scripture teaches\nconcerning devils, is that we may be careful to guard against their\ninsidious machinations, and may provide ourselves with such weapons as are\nsufficiently firm and strong to repel the most powerful enemies. For when\nSatan is called the god and prince of this world,(335) the strong man\narmed,(336) the prince of the power of the air,(337) a roaring lion,(338)\nthese descriptions only tend to make us more cautious and vigilant, and\nbetter prepared to encounter him. This is sometimes signified in express\nwords. For Peter, after having said that “the devil, as a roaring lion,\nwalketh about seeking whom he may devour,” immediately subjoins an\nexhortation to “resist him, steadfast in the faith.” And Paul, having\nsuggested that “we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against\nprincipalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this\nworld, against spiritual wickedness,”(339) immediately commands us to put\non suitable armour for so great and so perilous a conflict. Wherefore,\nhaving been previously warned that we are perpetually threatened by an\nenemy, and an enemy desperately bold and extremely strong, skilled in\nevery artifice, indefatigable in diligence and celerity, abundantly\nprovided with all kinds of weapons, and most expert in the science of war,\nlet us make it the grand object of our attention, that we suffer not\nourselves to be oppressed with slothfulness and inactivity, but, on the\ncontrary, arousing and collecting all our courage, be ready for a vigorous\nresistance; and as this warfare is terminated only by death, let us\nencourage ourselves to perseverance. But, above all, conscious of weakness\nand ignorance, let us implore the assistance of God, nor attempt any thing\nbut in reliance on him; since he alone can supply us with wisdom, and\nstrength, and courage, and armour.\nXIV. But, the more to excite and urge us to such conduct, the Scripture\nannounces that there are not one, or two, or a few enemies, but great\narmies who wage war against us. For even Mary Magdalene is said to have\nbeen delivered from seven demons, by whom she was possessed;(340) and\nChrist declares it to be a common case, that, if you leave the place open\nfor the re‐entrance of a demon who has once been ejected, he associates\nwith himself seven spirits more wicked still, and returns to his vacant\npossession.(341) Indeed, one man is said to have been possessed by a whole\nlegion.(342) By these passages, therefore, we are taught, that we have to\ncontend with an infinite multitude of enemies; lest, despising their\npaucity, we should be more remiss to encounter them, or, expecting\nsometimes an intermission of hostility, should indulge ourselves in\nidleness. But when one Satan or devil is frequently mentioned in the\nsingular number, it denotes that principality of wickedness which opposes\nthe kingdom of righteousness. For as the Church and society of saints have\nChrist as their head, so the faction of the impious, and impiety itself,\nare represented to us with their prince, who exercises the supreme power\namong them; which is the meaning of that sentence, “Depart, ye cursed,\ninto everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”(343)\nXV. It also ought to stimulate us to a perpetual war with the devil, that\nhe is every where called God’s adversary and ours. For, if we feel the\nconcern which we ought to feel for the glory of God, we shall exert all\nour power against him who attempts the extinction of it. If we are\nanimated by a becoming zeal for defending the kingdom of Christ, we must\nnecessarily have an irreconcilable war with him who conspires its ruin. On\nthe other hand, if we are solicitous for our salvation, we ought to make\nneither peace nor truce with him who assiduously plots its destruction.\nNow, such is the description given of him in the third chapter of Genesis,\nwhere he seduces man from the obedience owed by him to God, so that he at\nonce robs God of his just honour, and precipitates man into ruin. Such,\nalso, is he described in the Evangelists, where he is called an enemy, and\nsaid to sow tares in order to corrupt the seed of eternal life.(344) In\nshort, the testimony of Christ concerning him, that he was a murderer and\na liar from the beginning,(345) we find verified in all his actions. For\nhe opposes Divine truth with lies; obscures the light with shades of\ndarkness; involves the minds of men in errors; stirs up animosities, and\nkindles contentions and wars;—and all for the purpose of subverting the\nkingdom of God, and plunging mankind with himself into eternal\ndestruction. Whence it is evident, that he is naturally depraved, vicious,\nmalignant, and mischievous. For there must be extreme depravity in that\nmind which is bent on opposing the glory of God and the salvation of men.\nAnd this is suggested by John in his Epistle, when he says, that “he\nsinneth from the beginning.” For he intends, that he is the author,\nconductor, and principal contriver of all wickedness and iniquity.\nXVI. But since the devil was created by God, we must remark, that this\nwickedness which we attribute to his nature is not from creation, but from\ncorruption. For whatever evil quality he has, he has acquired by his\ndefection and fall. And of this the Scripture apprizes us; lest, believing\nhim to have come from God, just as he now is, we should ascribe to God\nhimself that which is in direct opposition to him. For this reason Christ\ndeclares, that Satan, “when he speaketh a lie, speaketh of his own;”(346)\nand adds the reason—“because he abode not in the truth.” When he says that\nhe abode not in the truth, he certainly implies that he had once been in\nit; and when he calls him the father of a lie, he precludes his imputing\nto God the depravity of his nature, which originated wholly from himself.\nThough these things are delivered in a brief and rather obscure manner,\nyet they are abundantly sufficient to vindicate the majesty of God from\nevery calumny. And what does it concern us to know, respecting devils,\neither more particulars, or for any other purpose? Some persons are\ndispleased that the Scripture does not give us, in various places, a\ndistinct and detailed account of their fall, with its cause, manner, time,\nand nature. But, these things being nothing to us, it was better for them,\nif not to be passed over in total silence, yet certainly to be touched on\nbut lightly; because it would ill comport with the dignity of the Holy\nSpirit to feed curiosity with vain and unprofitable histories; and we\nperceive it to have been the design of the Lord, to deliver nothing in his\nsacred oracles, which we might not learn to our edification. That we\nourselves, therefore, may not dwell upon unprofitable subjects, let us be\ncontent with this concise information respecting the nature of devils;\nthat at their creation they were originally angels of God, but by\ndegenerating have ruined themselves, and become the instruments of\nperdition to others. This being useful to be known, it is clearly stated\nby Peter and Jude. “God,” say they, “spared not the angels that sinned,\nand kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation.”(347) And\nPaul, mentioning the elect angels,(348) without doubt tacitly implies that\nthere are reprobate ones.\nXVII. The discord and contention, which we say Satan maintains against\nGod, ought to be understood in a manner consistent with a firm persuasion,\nthat he can do nothing without God’s will and consent. For we read in the\nhistory of Job, that he presented himself before God to receive his\ncommands, and dared not to undertake any enterprise without having\nobtained his permission.(349) Thus, also, when Ahab was to be deceived, he\nundertook to be a lying spirit in the mouth of all the prophets; and,\nbeing commissioned by God, he performed it.(350) For this reason he is\nalso called the “evil spirit from the Lord,” who tormented Saul,(351)\nbecause he was employed as a scourge to punish the sins of that impious\nmonarch. And elsewhere it is recorded, that the plagues were inflicted on\nthe Egyptians by the “evil angels.”(352) According to these particular\nexamples, Paul declares generally, that the blinding of unbelievers is the\nwork of God,(353) whereas he had before called it the operation of Satan.\nIt appears, then, that Satan is subject to the power of God, and so\ngoverned by his control, that he is compelled to render obedience to him.\nNow, when we say that Satan resists God, and that his works are contrary\nto the works of God, we at the same time assert that this repugnance and\ncontention depend on the Divine permission. I speak now, not of the will\nor the endeavour, but only of the effect. For the devil, being naturally\nwicked, has not the least inclination towards obedience to the Divine\nwill, but is wholly bent on insolence and rebellion. It therefore arises\nfrom himself and his wickedness, that he opposes God with all his desires\nand purposes. This depravity stimulates him to attempt those things which\nhe thinks the most opposed to God. But since God holds him tied and bound\nwith the bridle of his power, he executes only those things which are\ndivinely permitted; and thus, whether he will or not, he obeys his\nCreator, being constrained to fulfil any service to which he impels him.\nXVIII. While God directs the courses of unclean spirits hither and thither\nat his pleasure, he regulates this government in such a manner, that they\nexercise the faithful with fighting, attack them in ambuscades, harass\nthem with incursions, push them in battles, and frequently fatigue them,\nthrow them into confusion, terrify them, and sometimes wound them, yet\nnever conquer or overwhelm them; but subdue and lead captive the impious,\ntyrannize over their souls and bodies, and abuse them like slaves by\nemploying them in the perpetration of every enormity. The faithful, in\nconsequence of being harassed by such enemies, are addressed with the\nfollowing, and other similar exhortations: “Give not place to the\ndevil.”(354) “Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about,\nseeking whom he may devour; whom resist, steadfast in the faith.”(355)\nPaul confesses that he himself was not free from this kind of warfare,\nwhen he declares that, as a remedy to subdue pride, “the messenger of\nSatan was given to him to buffet him.”(356) This exercise, then, is common\nto all the children of God. But, as the promise respecting the breaking of\nthe head of Satan(357) belongs to Christ and all his members in common, I\ntherefore deny that the faithful can ever be conquered or overwhelmed by\nhim. They are frequently filled with consternation, but recover themselves\nagain; they fall by the violence of his blows, but are raised up again;\nthey are wounded, but not mortally; finally, they labour through their\nwhole lives in such a manner, as at last to obtain the victory. This,\nhowever, is not to be restricted to each single action. For we know that,\nby the righteous vengeance of God, David was for a time delivered to\nSatan, that by his instigation he might number the people;(358) nor is it\nwithout reason that Paul admits a hope of pardon even for those who may\nhave been entangled in the snares of the devil.(359) Therefore the same\nApostle shows, in another place, that the promise before cited is begun in\nthis life, where we must engage in the conflict; and that after the\ntermination of the conflict it will be completed. “And the God of peace,”\nhe says, “shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.”(360) In our Head\nthis victory, indeed, has always been complete, because the prince of this\nworld had nothing in him:(361) in us, who are his members, it yet appears\nonly in part, but will be completed when we shall have put off our flesh,\nwhich makes us still subject to infirmities, and shall be full of the\npower of the Holy Spirit. In this manner, when the kingdom of Christ is\nerected, Satan and his power must fall; as the Lord himself says, “I\nbeheld Satan as lightning falling from heaven.”(362) For by this answer he\nconfirms what the Apostles had reported concerning the power of his\npreaching. Again: “When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods\nare in peace; but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome\nhim,” &c.(363) And to this end Christ by his death overcame Satan, who had\nthe power of death, and triumphed over all his forces, that they might not\nbe able to hurt the Church; for otherwise it would be in hourly danger of\ndestruction. For such is our imbecility, and such the strength of his\nfury, how could we stand even for a moment against his various and\nunceasing attacks, without being supported by the victory of our Captain?\nTherefore God permits not Satan to exercise any power over the souls of\nthe faithful, but abandons to his government only the impious and\nunbelieving, whom he designs not to number among his own flock. For he is\nsaid to have the undisturbed possession of this world, till he is expelled\nby Christ.(364) He is said also to blind all who believe not the\nGospel,(365) and to work in the children of disobedience;(366) and this\njustly, for all the impious are vessels of wrath.(367) To whom, therefore,\nshould they be subjected, but to the minister of the Divine vengeance?\nFinally, they are said to be of their father the devil;(368) because, as\nthe faithful are known to be the children of God from their bearing his\nimage,(369) so the impious, from the image of Satan into which they have\ndegenerated, are properly considered as his children.\nXIX. But as we have already confuted that nugatory philosophy concerning\nthe holy angels, which teaches that they are nothing but inspirations, or\ngood motions, excited by God in the minds of men, so in this place we must\nrefute those who pretend that devils are nothing but evil affections or\nperturbations, which our flesh obtrudes on our minds. But this may be\neasily done, and that because the testimonies of Scripture on this subject\nare numerous and clear. First, when they are called unclean spirits and\napostate angels,(370) who have degenerated from their original condition,\nthe very names sufficiently express, not mental emotions or affections,\nbut rather in reality what are called minds, or spirits endued with\nperception and intelligence. Likewise, when the children of God are\ncompared with the children of the devil, both by Christ and by John,(371)\nwould not the comparison be absurd, if nothing were intended by the word\n_devil_ but evil inspirations? And John adds something still plainer, that\nthe devil sins from the beginning. Likewise, when Jude introduces Michael\nthe archangel contending with the devil,(372) he certainly opposes to the\ngood angel an evil and rebellious one; to which agrees what is recorded in\nthe history of Job, that Satan appeared with the holy angels before\nGod.(373) But the clearest of all are those passages, which mention the\npunishment which they begin to feel from the judgment of God, and are to\nfeel much more at the resurrection: “Thou Son of God, art thou come hither\nto torment us before the time?”(374) Also, “Depart, ye cursed, into\neverlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”(375) Again, “If\nGod spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and\ndelivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment,”\n&c.(376) How unmeaning were these expressions, that the devils are\nappointed to eternal judgment; that fire is prepared for them; that they\nare now tormented and vexed by the glory of Christ, if there were no\ndevils at all! But since this point is not a subject of dispute with those\nwho give credit to the word of the Lord, but with those vain speculators\nwho are pleased with nothing but novelty, little good can be effected by\ntestimonies of Scripture. I consider myself as having done what I\nintended, which was to fortify the pious mind against such a species of\nerrors, with which restless men disturb themselves and others that are\nmore simple. But it was requisite to touch on it, lest any persons\ninvolved in that error, under a supposition that they have no adversary,\nshould become more slothful and incautious to resist him.\nXX. Yet let us not disdain to receive a pious delight from the works of\nGod, which every where present themselves to view in this very beautiful\ntheatre of the world. For this, as I have elsewhere observed, though not\nthe principal, is yet, in the order of nature, the first lesson of faith,\nto remember that, whithersoever we turn our eyes, all the things which we\nbehold are the works of God; and at the same time to consider, with pious\nmeditation, for what end God created them. Therefore to apprehend, by a\ntrue faith, what it is for our benefit to know concerning God, we must\nfirst of all understand the history of the creation of the world, as it is\nbriefly related by Moses, and afterwards more copiously illustrated by\nholy men, particularly by Basil and Ambrose. Thence we shall learn that\nGod, by the power of his Word and Spirit, created out of nothing the\nheaven and the earth; that from them he produced all things, animate and\ninanimate; distinguished by an admirable gradation the innumerable variety\nof things; to every species gave its proper nature, assigned its offices,\nand appointed its places and stations; and since all things are subject to\ncorruption, has, nevertheless, provided for the preservation of every\nspecies till the last day; that he therefore nourishes some by methods\nconcealed from us, from time to time infusing, as it were, new vigour into\nthem; that on some he has conferred the power of propagation, in order\nthat the whole species may not be extinct at their death; that he has thus\nwonderfully adorned heaven and earth with the utmost possible abundance,\nvariety, and beauty, like a large and splendid mansion, most exquisitely\nand copiously furnished; lastly, that, by creating man, and distinguishing\nhim with such splendid beauty, and with such numerous and great\nprivileges, he has exhibited in him a most excellent specimen of all his\nworks. But since it is not my design to treat at large of the creation of\nthe world, let it suffice to have again dropped these few hints by the\nway. For it is better, as I have just advised the reader, to seek for\nfuller information on this subject from Moses, and others who have\nfaithfully and diligently recorded the history of the world.\nXXI. It is useless to enter into a prolix disputation respecting the right\ntendency and legitimate design of a consideration of the works of God,\nsince this question has been, in a great measure, determined in another\nplace, and, as much as concerns our present purpose, may be despatched in\nfew words. Indeed, if we wished to explain how the inestimable wisdom,\npower, justice, and goodness, of God are manifested in the formation of\nthe world, no splendour or ornament of diction will equal the magnitude of\nso great a subject. And it is undoubtedly the will of the Lord, that we\nshould be continually employed in this holy meditation; that, while we\ncontemplate in all the creatures, as in so many mirrors, the infinite\nriches of his wisdom, justice, goodness, and power, we might not only take\na transient and cursory view of them, but might long dwell on the idea,\nseriously and faithfully revolve it in our minds, and frequently recall it\nto our memory. But, this being a didactic treatise, we must omit those\ntopics which require long declamations. To be brief, therefore, let the\nreaders know, that they have then truly apprehended by faith what is meant\nby God being the Creator of heaven and earth, if they, in the first place,\nfollow this universal rule, not to pass over, with ungrateful inattention\nor oblivion, those glorious perfections which God manifests in his\ncreatures; and, secondly, learn to make such an application to themselves\nas thoroughly to affect their hearts. The first point is exemplified, when\nwe consider how great must have been the Artist who disposed that\nmultitude of stars, which adorn the heaven, in such a regular order, that\nit is impossible to imagine any thing more beautiful to behold; who fixed\nsome in their stations, so that they cannot be moved; who granted to\nothers a freer course, but so that they never travel beyond their\nappointed limits; who so regulates the motions of all, that they measure\ndays and nights, months, years, and seasons of the year; and also reduces\nthe inequality of days, which we constantly witness, to such a medium that\nit occasions no confusion. So, also, when we observe his power in\nsustaining so great a mass, in governing the rapid revolutions of the\ncelestial machine, and the like. For these few examples sufficiently\ndeclare, what it is to recognize the perfections of God in the creation of\nthe world. Otherwise, were I desirous of pursuing the subject to its full\nextent, there would be no end; since there are as many miracles of Divine\npower, as many monuments of Divine goodness, as many proofs of Divine\nwisdom, as there are species of things in the world, and even as there are\nindividual things, either great or small.\nXXII. There remains the other point, which approaches more nearly to\nfaith; that, while we observe how God has appointed all things for our\nbenefit and safety, and at the same time perceive his power and grace in\nourselves, and the great benefits which he has conferred on us, we may\nthence excite ourselves to confide in him, to invoke him, to praise him,\nand to love him. Now, as I have just before suggested, God himself has\ndemonstrated, by the very order of creation, that he made all things for\nthe sake of man. For it was not without reason that he distributed the\nmaking of the world into six days; though it would have been no more\ndifficult for him to complete the whole work, in all its parts, at once,\nin a single moment, than to arrive at its completion by such progressive\nadvances. But in this he has been pleased to display his providence and\npaternal solicitude towards us, since, before he would make man, he\nprepared every thing which he foresaw would be useful or beneficial to\nhim. How great would be, now, the ingratitude to doubt whether we are\nregarded by this best of fathers, whom we perceive to have been solicitous\non our account before we existed! How impious would it be to tremble with\ndiffidence, lest at any time his benignity should desert us in our\nnecessities, which we see was displayed in the greatest affluence of all\nblessings provided for us while we were yet unborn! Besides, we are told\nby Moses,(377) that his liberality has subjected to us all that is\ncontained in the whole world. He certainly has not made this declaration\nin order to tantalize us with the empty name of such a donation. Therefore\nwe never shall be destitute of any thing which will conduce to our\nwelfare. Finally, to conclude, whenever we call God the Creator of heaven\nand earth, let us at the same time reflect, that the dispensation of all\nthose things which he has made is in his own power, and that we are his\nchildren, whom he has received into his charge and custody, to be\nsupported and educated; so that we may expect every blessing from him\nalone, and cherish a certain hope that he will never suffer us to want\nthose things which are necessary to our well‐being, that our hope may\ndepend on no other; that, whatever we need or desire, our prayers may be\ndirected to him, and that, from whatever quarter we receive any advantage,\nwe may acknowledge it to be his benefit, and confess it with thanksgiving;\nthat, being allured with such great sweetness of goodness and beneficence,\nwe may study to love and worship him with all our hearts."

          "title": "Chapter XV. The State Of Man At His Creation, The Faculties Of The Soul,",
          "content": "The Divine Image, Free Will, And The Original Purity Of His Nature.\nWe must now treat of the creation of man, not only because he exhibits the\nmost noble and remarkable specimen of the Divine justice, wisdom, and\ngoodness, among all the works of God, but because, as we observed in the\nbeginning, we cannot attain to a clear and solid knowledge of God, without\na mutual acquaintance with ourselves. But though this is twofold,—the\nknowledge of the condition in which we were originally created, and of\nthat into which we entered after the fall of Adam, (for indeed we should\nderive but little advantage from a knowledge of our creation, unless in\nthe lamentable ruin which has befallen us we discovered the corruption and\ndeformity of our nature,)—yet we shall content ourselves at present with a\ndescription of human nature in its primitive integrity. And, indeed,\nbefore we proceed to the miserable condition in which man is now involved,\nit is necessary to understand the state in which he was first created. For\nwe must beware lest, in precisely pointing out the natural evils of man,\nwe seem to refer them to the Author of nature; since impious men suppose\nthat this pretext affords them a sufficient defence, if they can plead\nthat whatever defect or fault they have, proceeds in some measure from\nGod; nor do they hesitate, if reproved, to litigate with God himself, and\ntransfer to him the crime of which they are justly accused. And those who\nwould be thought to speak with more reverence concerning the Deity, yet\nreadily endeavour to excuse their depravity from nature, not considering\nthat they also, though in a more obscure manner, are guilty of defaming\nthe character of God; to whose dishonour it would redound, if nature could\nbe proved to have had any innate depravity at its formation. Since we see\nthe flesh, therefore, eagerly catching at every subterfuge, by which it\nsupposes that the blame of its evils may by any means be transferred from\nitself to any other, we must diligently oppose this perverseness. The\ncalamity of mankind must be treated in such a manner as to preclude all\ntergiversation, and to vindicate the Divine justice from every accusation.\nWe shall afterwards, in the proper place, see how far men are fallen from\nthat purity which was bestowed upon Adam. And first let it be understood,\nthat, by his being made of earth and clay, a restraint was laid upon\npride; since nothing is more absurd than for creatures to glory in their\nexcellence, who not only inhabit a cottage of clay, but who are themselves\ncomposed partly of dust and ashes.(378) But as God not only deigned to\nanimate the earthen vessel, but chose to make it the residence of an\nimmortal spirit, Adam might justly glory in so great an instance of the\nliberality of his Maker.\nII. That man consists of soul and body, ought not to be controverted. By\nthe “soul” I understand an immortal, yet created essence, which is the\nnobler part of him. Sometimes it is called a “spirit;” for though, when\nthese names are connected, they have a different signification, yet when\n“spirit” is used separately, it means the same as “soul;” as when Solomon,\nspeaking of death, says that “then the spirit shall return unto God, who\ngave it.”(379) And Christ commending his spirit to the Father,(380) and\nStephen his to Christ,(381) intend no other than that, when the soul is\nliberated from the prison of the flesh, God is its perpetual keeper. Those\nwho imagine that the soul is called a spirit, because it is a breath or\nfaculty divinely infused into the body, but destitute of any essence, are\nproved to be in a gross error by the thing itself, and by the whole tenor\nof Scripture. It is true, indeed, that, while men are immoderately\nattached to the earth, they become stupid, and, being alienated from the\nFather of lights, are immersed in darkness, so that they consider not that\nthey shall survive after death; yet in the mean time, the light is not so\nentirely extinguished by the darkness, but that they are affected with\nsome sense of their immortality. Surely the conscience, which, discerning\nbetween good and evil, answers to the judgment of God, is an indubitable\nproof of an immortal spirit. For how could an affection or emotion,\nwithout any essence, penetrate to the tribunal of God, and inspire itself\nwith terror on account of its guilt? For the body is not affected by a\nfear of spiritual punishment; that falls only on the soul; whence it\nfollows, that it is possessed of an essence. Now, the very knowledge of\nGod sufficiently proves the immortality of the soul, which rises above the\nworld, since an evanescent breath or inspiration could not arrive at the\nfountain of life. Lastly, the many noble faculties with which the human\nmind is adorned, and which loudly proclaim that something Divine is\ninscribed on it, are so many testimonies of its immortal essence. For the\nsense which the brutes have, extends not beyond the body, or at most not\nbeyond the objects near it. But the agility of the human mind, looking\nthrough heaven and earth, and the secrets of nature, and comprehending in\nits intellect and memory all ages, digesting every thing in proper order,\nand concluding future events from those which are past, clearly\ndemonstrates that there is concealed within man something distinct from\nthe body. In our minds we form conceptions of the invisible God and of\nangels, to which the body is not at all competent. We apprehend what is\nright, just, and honest, which is concealed from the corporeal senses. The\nspirit, therefore, must be the seat of this intelligence. Even sleep\nitself, which, stupefying man, seems to divest him even of life, is no\nobscure proof of immortality; since it not only suggests to us ideas of\nthings which never happened, but also presages of future events. I briefly\ntouch those things which even profane writers magnificently extol in a\nmore splendid and ornamented diction; but with the pious reader the simple\nmention of them will be sufficient. Now, unless the soul were something\nessentially distinct from the body, the Scripture would not inform us that\nwe dwell in houses of clay,(382) and at death quit the tabernacle of the\nflesh;(383) that we put off the corruptible,(384) to receive a reward at\nthe last day, according to the respective conduct of each individual in\nthe body.(385) For certainly these and similar passages, which often\noccur, not only manifestly distinguish the soul from the body, but, by\ntransferring to it the name of “man,” indicate that it is the principal\npart of our nature. When Paul exhorts the faithful to cleanse themselves\nfrom all filthiness of the flesh and of the spirit,(386) he points out two\nparts in which the defilement of sin resides. Peter also, when he called\nChrist the Shepherd and Bishop of souls,(387) would have spoken\nimproperly, if there were no souls over whom he could exercise that\noffice. Nor would there be any consistency in what he says concerning the\neternal salvation of souls, or in his injunction to purify the souls, or\nin his assertion that fleshly lusts war against the soul,(388) or in what\nthe author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says, that pastors watch to give\nan account of our souls,(389) unless souls had a proper essence. To the\nsame purpose is the place where Paul “calls God for a record upon his\nsoul,”(390) because it could not be amenable to God, if it were not\ncapable of punishment; which is also more clearly expressed in the words\nof Christ, where he commands us to fear him, who, after having killed the\nbody, is able to cast the soul into hell.(391) Where the author of the\nEpistle to the Hebrews distinguishes between the fathers of our flesh, and\nGod, who is the only Father of spirits,(392) he could not assert the\nessence or existence of the soul in more express terms. Besides, unless\nthe soul survived after its liberation from the prison of the body, it was\nabsurd for Christ to represent the soul of Lazarus as enjoying happiness\nin the bosom of Abraham, and the soul of the rich man as condemned to\ndreadful torments.(393) Paul confirms the same point, by informing us that\nwe are absent from God as long as we dwell in the body, but that when\nabsent from the body we are present with the Lord.(394) Not to be too\nprolix on a subject of so little obscurity, I shall only add this from\nLuke, that it is reckoned among the errors of the Sadducees, that they\nbelieved not the existence of angels or of spirits.(395)\nIII. A solid proof of this point may also be gathered from man being said\nto be created in the image of God.(396) For though the glory of God is\ndisplayed in his external form, yet there is no doubt that the proper seat\nof his image is in the soul. I admit that external form, as it\ndistinguishes us from brutes, also exalts us more nearly to God; nor will\nI too vehemently contend with any one who would understand, by the image\nof God, that\n“—— while the mute creation downward bend\nTheir sight, and to their earthly mother tend,\nMan looks aloft, and with erected eyes\nBeholds his own hereditary skies.”(397)\nOnly let it be decided that the image of God, which appears or sparkles in\nthese external characters, is spiritual. For Osiander, whose perverse\ningenuity in futile notions is proved by his writings, extending the image\nof God promiscuously to the body as well as to the soul, confounds heaven\nand earth together. He says, that the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit,\nfixed their image in man, because, even if Adam had remained in his\nintegrity, Christ would, nevertheless, have become man. Thus, according to\nhim, the body which had been destined for Christ was the exemplar and type\nof that corporeal figure which was then formed. But where will he find\nthat Christ is the image of the Spirit? I grant, indeed, that the glory of\nthe whole Deity shines in the person of the Mediator; but how shall the\neternal Word be called the image of the Spirit, whom he precedes in order?\nLastly, it subverts the distinction between the Son and Spirit, if the\nformer be denominated the image of the latter. Besides, I could wish to be\ninformed by him, how Christ, in the body which he has assumed, resembles\nthe Spirit, and by what characters or lineaments his similitude is\nexpressed. And since that speech, “Let us make man in our own image,”(398)\nbelongs also to the person of the Son, it follows that he is the image of\nhimself; which is altogether repugnant to reason. Moreover, if the notion\nof Osiander be received, man was formed only to the type or exemplar of\nthe humanity of Christ; and the idea from which Adam was taken was Christ,\nas about to be clothed in flesh; whereas the Scripture teaches, in a very\ndifferent sense, that man was “created in the image of God.” There is more\nplausibility in the subtlety of those who maintain that Adam was created\nin the image of God, because he was conformed to Christ, who is the only\nimage of God. But this also is destitute of solidity. There is no small\ncontroversy concerning “image” and “likeness” among expositors who seek\nfor a difference, whereas in reality there is none, between the two words;\n“likeness” being only added by way of explanation. In the first place, we\nknow that it is the custom of the Hebrews to use repetitions, in which\nthey express one thing twice. In the next place, as to the thing itself,\nthere is no doubt but man is called the image of God, on account of his\nlikeness to God. Hence it appears that those persons make themselves\nridiculous who display more subtlety in criticising on these terms,\nwhether they confine _zelem_, that is, “image,” to the substance of the\nsoul, and _demuth_, that is, “likeness,” to its qualities, or whether they\nbring forward any different interpretation. Because, when God determined\nto create man in his own image, that expression being rather obscure, he\nrepeats the same idea in this explanatory phrase, “after our likeness;” as\nthough he had said that he was about to make man, in whom, as in an image,\nhe would give a representation of himself by the characters of resemblance\nwhich he would impress upon him. Therefore Moses, a little after, reciting\nthe same thing, introduces the image of God, but makes no mention of his\nlikeness. The objection of Osiander is quite frivolous, that it is not a\npart of man, or the soul with its faculties, that is called the image of\nGod, but the whole Adam, who received his name from the earth whence he\nwas taken; it will be deemed frivolous, I say, by every rational reader.\nFor when the whole man is called mortal, the soul is not therefore made\nsubject to death; nor, on the other hand, when man is called a rational\nanimal, does reason or intelligence therefore belong to the body. Though\nthe soul, therefore, is not the whole man, yet there is no absurdity in\ncalling him the image of God with relation to the soul; although I retain\nthe principle which I have just laid down, that the image of God includes\nall the excellence in which the nature of man surpasses all the other\nspecies of animals. This term, therefore, denotes the integrity which Adam\npossessed, when he was endued with a right understanding, when he had\naffections regulated by reason, and all his senses governed in proper\norder, and when, in the excellency of his nature, he truly resembled the\nexcellence of his Creator. And though the principal seat of the Divine\nimage was in the mind and heart, or in the soul and its faculties, yet\nthere was no part of man, not even the body, which was not adorned with\nsome rays of its glory. It is certain that the lineaments of the Divine\nglory are conspicuous in every part of the world; whence it may be\nconcluded, that where the image of God is said to be in man, there is\nimplied a tacit antithesis, which exalts man above all the other\ncreatures, and as it were separates him from the vulgar herd. It is not to\nbe denied that angels were created in the similitude of God, since our\nhighest perfection will consist, according to the declaration of Christ,\nin being like them.(399) But it is not in vain that Moses celebrates the\nfavour of God towards us by this peculiar title; especially as he compares\nman only to visible creatures.\nIV. No complete definition of this image, however, appears yet to be\ngiven, unless it be more clearly specified in what faculties man excels,\nand in what respects he ought to be accounted a mirror of the Divine\nglory. But that cannot be better known from any thing, than from the\nreparation of his corrupted nature. There is no doubt that Adam, when he\nfell from his dignity, was by this defection alienated from God.\nWherefore, although we allow that the Divine image was not utterly\nannihilated and effaced in him, yet it was so corrupted that whatever\nremains is but horrible deformity. And therefore the beginning of our\nrecovery and salvation is the restoration which we obtain through Christ,\nwho on this account is called the second Adam; because he restores us to\ntrue and perfect integrity. For although Paul, opposing the quickening\nSpirit received by the faithful from Christ, to the living soul in which\nAdam was created,(400) celebrates the degree of grace displayed in\nregeneration as superior to that manifested in creation, yet he\ncontradicts not that other capital point, that this is the end of\nregeneration, that Christ may form us anew in the image of God. Therefore\nhe elsewhere informs us, that “the new man is renewed in knowledge after\nthe image of him that created him.”(401) With which corresponds the\nfollowing exhortation—“Put on the new man, which after God is created in\nrighteousness and true holiness.”(402) Now, we may see what Paul\ncomprehends in this renovation. In the first place, he mentions knowledge,\nand in the next place, sincere righteousness and holiness; whence we\ninfer, that in the beginning the image of God was conspicuous in the light\nof the mind, in the rectitude of the heart, and in the soundness of all\nthe parts of our nature. For though I grant that the forms of expression\nare synecdochical, signifying the whole by a part, yet this is an axiom\nwhich cannot be overturned, that what holds the principal place in the\nrenovation of the Divine image, must also have held the same place in the\ncreation of it at first. To the same purpose is another passage of the\nApostle, that “we, with open face beholding the glory of Christ, are\nchanged into the same image.”(403) We see, now, how Christ is the most\nperfect image of God, to which being conformed, we are so restored that we\nbear the Divine image in true piety, righteousness, purity, and\nunderstanding. This position being established, the imagination of\nOsiander, about the figure of the body, immediately vanishes of itself.\nThe passage where Paul calls the man “the image and glory of God,”(404) to\nthe exclusion of the woman from that degree of honour, appears from the\ncontext to be confined to political subordination. But that the image\nwhich has been mentioned comprehended whatever relates to spiritual and\neternal life, has now, I think, been sufficiently proved. John confirms\nthe same in other words, by asserting that “the life” which was from the\nbeginning in the eternal Word of God, “was the light of men.”(405) For as\nhe intended to praise the singular favour of God which exalts man above\nall the other animals; to separate him from the common number, because he\nhas attained no vulgar life, but a life connected with the light of\nintelligence and reason,—he at the same time shows how he was made after\nthe image of God. Therefore, since the image of God is the uncorrupted\nexcellence of human nature, which shone in Adam before his defection, but\nwas afterwards so corrupted, and almost obliterated, that nothing remains\nfrom the ruin but what is confused, mutilated, and defiled,—it is now\npartly visible in the elect, inasmuch as they are regenerated by the\nSpirit, but it will obtain its full glory in heaven. But that we may know\nthe parts of which it consists, it is necessary to treat of the faculties\nof the soul. For that speculation of Augustine is far from being solid,\nthat the soul is a mirror of the Trinity, because it contains\nunderstanding, will, and memory. Nor is there any probability in the\nopinion which places the similitude of God in the dominion committed to\nman; as though he resembled God only in this character, that he was\nconstituted heir and possessor of all things, whereas it must properly be\nsought _in_ him, not _without_ him; it is an internal excellence of the\nsoul.\nV. But, before I proceed any further, it is necessary to combat the\nManichæan error, which Servetus has attempted to revive and propagate in\nthe present age. Because God is said to have breathed into man the breath\nof life,(406) they supposed that the soul was an emanation from the\nsubstance of God; as though some portion of the infinite Deity had been\nconveyed into man. But it may be easily and briefly shown how many\nshameful and gross absurdities are the necessary consequences of this\ndiabolical error. For if the soul of man be an emanation from the essence\nof God, it will follow that the Divine nature is not only mutable and\nsubject to passions, but also to ignorance, desires, and vices of every\nkind. Nothing is more inconstant than man, because his soul is agitated\nand variously distracted by contrary motions; he frequently mistakes\nthrough ignorance; he is vanquished by some of the smallest temptations;\nwe know that the soul is the receptacle of every kind of impurity;—all\nwhich we must ascribe to the Divine nature, if we believe the soul to be\npart of the essence of God, or a secret influx of the Deity. Who would not\ndread such a monstrous tenet? It is a certain truth, quoted by Paul from\nAratus, that “we are the offspring of God,” but in quality, not in\nsubstance; forasmuch as he has adorned us with Divine endowments.(407) But\nto divide the essence of the Creator, that every creature may possess a\npart of it, indicates extreme madness. It must therefore be concluded\nbeyond all doubt, notwithstanding the Divine image is impressed on the\nsouls of men, that they were no less created than the angels. And creation\nis not a transfusion, but an origination of existence from nothing. Nor,\nbecause the spirit is given by God, and returns to him on its departure\nfrom the body, is it immediately to be asserted, that it was plucked off\nlike a branch from his essence. And on this point also Osiander, while he\nis elated with his own illusions, has involved himself in an impious\nerror, not acknowledging the image of God in man without his essential\nrighteousness, as though God could not, by the inconceivable power of his\nSpirit, render us conformable to himself, unless Christ were to transfuse\nhimself substantially into us. However some persons may attempt to gloss\nover these delusions, they will never so far blind the eyes of sensible\nreaders, as to prevent their perceiving that they savour of the error of\nthe Manichæans. And where Paul treats of the restoration of this image, we\nmay readily conclude from his words, that man was conformed to God not by\nan influx of his substance, but by the grace and power of his Spirit. For\nhe says that, by beholding the glory of Christ, we are transformed into\nthe same image as by the Spirit of the Lord;(408) who certainly operates\nin us not in such a manner as to render us consubstantial with God.\nVI. It would be folly to seek for a definition of the soul from the\nheathen philosophers, of whom Plato is almost the only one who has plainly\nasserted it to be an immortal substance. Others indeed, the disciples of\nSocrates, hint at it, but with great doubts; no one clearly teaches that\nof which he was not persuaded himself. The sentiment of Plato, therefore,\nis more correct, because he considers the image of God as being in the\nsoul. The other sects so confine its powers and faculties to the present\nlife, that they leave it nothing beyond the body. But we have before\nstated from the Scripture, that it is an incorporeal substance; now we\nshall add, that although it is not properly contained in any place, yet,\nbeing put into the body, it inhabits it as its dwelling, not only to\nanimate all its parts, and render the organs fit and useful for their\nrespective operations, but also to hold the supremacy in the government of\nhuman life; and that not only in the concerns of the terrestrial life, but\nlikewise to excite to the worship of God. Though this last point is not so\nevident in the state of corruption, yet there remain some relics of it\nimpressed even on our very vices. For whence proceeds the great concern of\nmen about their reputation, but from shame? but whence proceeds shame,\nunless from a respect for virtue? The principle and cause of which is,\nthat they understand themselves to have been born for the cultivation of\nrighteousness; and in which are included the seeds of religion. But as,\nwithout controversy, man was created to aspire to a heavenly life, so it\nis certain that the knowledge of it was impressed on his soul. And,\nindeed, man would be deprived of the principal use of his understanding,\nif he were ignorant of his felicity, the perfection of which consists in\nbeing united to God. Thus the chief operation of the soul is to aspire\nafter it; and, therefore, the more a man studies to approach to God, the\nmore he proves himself a rational creature. Some maintain that in man\nthere are more souls than one, a sensitive and a rational one; but\nnotwithstanding some appearance of probability in what they adduce, yet,\nas there is nothing solid in their arguments, we must reject them, unless\nwe are fond of tormenting ourselves with frivolous and useless things.\nThey say that there is a great repugnancy between the organic motions and\nthe rational part of the soul; as though reason were not also at variance\nwith itself, and some of its counsels were not in opposition to others,\nlike hostile armies. But as this confusion proceeds from the depravity of\nnature, it affords no ground for concluding that there are two souls,\nbecause the faculties are not sufficiently harmonious with each other. But\nall curious discussion respecting the faculties themselves I leave to the\nphilosophers; a simple definition will suffice us for the edification of\npiety. I confess, indeed, that the things which they teach are true, and\nnot only entertaining to be known, but useful and well digested by them;\nnor do I prohibit those who are desirous of learning from the study of\nthem. I admit, then, in the first place, that there are five senses, which\nPlato would rather call organs, by which all objects are conveyed into a\ncommon sensory, as into a general repository; that next follows the fancy\nor imagination, which discerns the objects apprehended by the common\nsensory; next reason, to which belongs universal judgment; lastly, the\nunderstanding, which steadily and quietly contemplates the objects\nrevolved and considered by reason. And thus to the understanding, reason,\nand imagination, the three intellectual faculties of the soul, correspond\nalso the three appetitive ones—the will, whose place it is to choose those\nthings which the understanding and reason propose to it; the irascible\nfaculty, which embraces the things offered to it by reason and\nimagination; and the concupiscible faculty, which apprehends the objects\npresented by the imagination and sensation. Though these things are true,\nor at least probable, yet, since I fear that they will involve us in their\nobscurity rather than assist us, I think they ought to be omitted. If any\none chooses to make a different distribution of the powers of the soul, so\nas to call one appetitive, which, though void of reason in itself, obeys\nreason, if it be under the guidance of any other faculty; and to call\nanother intellective, which is itself a partaker of reason; I shall not\nmuch oppose it. Nor have I any wish to combat the sentiment of Aristotle,\nthat there are three principles of action—sense, intellect, and appetite.\nBut let us rather choose a division placed within the comprehension of\nall, and which certainly cannot be sought in the philosophers. For when\nthey wish to speak with the greatest simplicity, they divide the soul into\nappetite and intellect, and make both these twofold. The latter, they say,\nis sometimes contemplative, being content merely with knowledge, and\nhaving no tendency to action,—which Cicero thinks is designated by the\nword _ingenium_,—and sometimes practical, variously influencing the will\nwith the apprehension of good or evil. This division comprehends the\nscience of living in a just and virtuous manner. The latter, that is,\nappetite, they divide into will and concupiscence; they call it “will,”\nwhenever appetite obeys reason; but when, shaking off the yoke of reason,\nit runs into intemperance, they give it the name of “concupiscence.” Thus\nthey imagine that man is always possessed of reason sufficient for the\nproper government of himself.\nVII. We are constrained to depart a little from this mode of instruction,\nbecause the philosophers, being ignorant of the corruption of nature\nproceeding from the punishment of the fall, improperly confound two very\ndifferent states of mankind. Let us, therefore, submit the following\ndivision—that the human soul has two faculties which relate to our present\ndesign, the understanding and the will. Now, let it be the office of the\nunderstanding to discriminate between objects, as they shall respectively\nappear deserving of approbation or disapprobation; but of the will, to\nchoose and follow what the understanding shall have pronounced to be good;\nto abhor and avoid what it shall have condemned. Here let us not stay to\ndiscuss those subtleties of Aristotle, that the mind has no motion of\nitself, but that it is moved by the choice, which he also calls the\nappetitive intellect. Without perplexing ourselves with unnecessary\nquestions, it should be sufficient for us to know that the understanding\nis, as it were, the guide and governor of the soul; that the will always\nrespects its authority, and waits for its judgment in its desires. For\nwhich reason Aristotle himself truly observed, that avoidance and pursuit\nin the appetite, bear a resemblance to affirmation and negation in the\nmind. How certain the government of the understanding is in the direction\nof the will, we shall see in another part of this work. Here we only\nintend to show that no power can be found in the soul, which may not\nproperly be referred to one or the other of those two members. But in this\nmanner we comprehend the sense in the understanding, which some\ndistinguish thus: sense, they say, inclines to pleasure, whereas the\nunderstanding follows what is good; that thence it happens that the\nappetite of sense becomes concupiscence and lust, and the affection of the\nunderstanding becomes will. But instead of the word “appetite,” which they\nprefer, I use the word “will,” which is more common.\nVIII. God has furnished the soul of man, therefore, with a mind capable of\ndiscerning good from evil, and just from unjust; and of discovering, by\nthe light of reason, what ought to be pursued or avoided; whence the\nphilosophers called this directing faculty το ἠγεμονικον, the principal or\ngoverning part. To this he has annexed the will, on which depends the\nchoice. The primitive condition of man was ennobled with those eminent\nfaculties; he possessed reason, understanding, prudence, and judgment, not\nonly for the government of his life on earth, but to enable him to ascend\neven to God and eternal felicity. To these was added choice, to direct the\nappetites, and regulate all the organic motions; so that the will should\nbe entirely conformed to the government of reason. In this integrity man\nwas endued with free will, by which, if he had chosen, he might have\nobtained eternal life. For here it would be unreasonable to introduce the\nquestion respecting the secret predestination of God, because we are not\ndiscussing what might possibly have happened or not, but what was the real\nnature of man. Adam, therefore, could have stood if he would, since he\nfell merely by his own will; but because his will was flexible to either\nside, and he was not endued with constancy to persevere, therefore he so\neasily fell. Yet his choice of good and evil was free; and not only so,\nbut his mind and will were possessed of consummate rectitude, and all his\norganic parts were rightly disposed to obedience, till, destroying\nhimself, he corrupted all his excellencies. Hence proceeded the darkness\nwhich overspread the minds of the philosophers, because they sought for a\ncomplete edifice among ruins, and for beautiful order in the midst of\nconfusion. They held this principle, that man would not be a rational\nanimal, unless he were endued with a free choice of good or evil; they\nconceived also that otherwise all difference between virtue and vice would\nbe destroyed, unless man regulated his life according to his own\ninclination. Thus far it had been well, if there had been no change in\nman, of which as they were ignorant, it is not to be wondered at if they\nconfound heaven and earth together. But those who profess themselves to be\ndisciples of Christ, and yet seek for free will in man, now lost and\noverwhelmed in spiritual ruin, in striking out a middle path between the\nopinions of the philosophers and the doctrine of heaven, are evidently\ndeceived, so that they touch neither heaven nor earth. But these things\nwill be better introduced in the proper place. At present be it only\nremembered, that man, at his first creation, was very different from all\nhis posterity, who, deriving their original from him in his corrupted\nstate, have contracted an hereditary defilement. For all the parts of his\nsoul were formed with the utmost rectitude; he enjoyed soundness of mind,\nand a will free to the choice of good. If any object, that he was placed\nin a dangerous situation on account of the imbecility of this faculty, I\nreply, that the station in which he was placed was sufficient to deprive\nhim of all excuse. For it would have been unreasonable that God should be\nconfined to this condition, to make man so as to be altogether incapable\neither of choosing or of committing any sin. It is true that such a nature\nwould have been more excellent; but to expostulate with God as though he\nhad been under any obligation to bestow this upon man, were unreasonable\nand unjust in the extreme; since it was at his choice to bestow as little\nas he pleased. But why he did not sustain him with the power of\nperseverance, remains concealed in his mind; but it is our duty to\nrestrain our investigations within the limits of sobriety. He had received\nthe power, indeed, if he chose to exert it; but he had not the will to use\nthat power; for the consequence of this will would have been perseverance.\nYet there is no excuse for him; he received so much, that he was the\nvoluntary procurer of his own destruction; but God was under no necessity\nto give him any other than an indifferent and mutable will, that from his\nfall he might educe matter for his own glory."

          "title": "Chapter XVI. God’s Preservation And Support Of The World By His Power, And",
          "content": "His Government Of Every Part Of It By His Providence.\nTo represent God as a Creator only for a moment, who entirely finished all\nhis work at once, were frigid and jejune; and in this it behoves us\nespecially to differ from the heathen, that the presence of the Divine\npower may appear to us no less in the perpetual state of the world than in\nits first origin. For although the minds even of impious men, by the mere\ncontemplation of earth and heaven, are constrained to rise to the Creator,\nyet faith has a way peculiar to itself to assign to God the whole praise\nof creation. To which purpose is that assertion of an Apostle before\ncited, that it is only “through faith that we understand the worlds were\nframed by the word of God;”(409) because, unless we proceed to his\nprovidence, we have no correct conception of the meaning of this article,\n“that God is the Creator;” however we may appear to comprehend it in our\nminds, and to confess it with our tongues. The carnal sense, when it has\nonce viewed the power of God in the creation, stops there; and when it\nproceeds the furthest, it only examines and considers the wisdom, and\npower, and goodness, of the Author in producing such a work, which\nspontaneously present themselves to the view even of those who are\nunwilling to observe them. In the next place, it conceives of some general\noperation of God in preserving and governing it, on which the power of\nmotion depends. Lastly, it supposes that the vigour originally infused by\nGod into all things is sufficient for their sustentation. But faith ought\nto penetrate further. When it has learned that he is the Creator of all\nthings, it should immediately conclude that he is also their perpetual\ngovernor and preserver; and that not by a certain universal motion,\nactuating the whole machine of the world, and all its respective parts,\nbut by a particular providence sustaining, nourishing, and providing for\nevery thing which he has made.(410) Thus David, having briefly premised\nthat the world was made by God, immediately descends to the continual\ncourse of his providence: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made;\nand all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.”(411) He afterwards\nadds, “The Lord beholdeth all the sons of men;”(412) and subjoins more to\nthe same purpose. For though all men argue not so skilfully, yet, since it\nwould not be credible that God was concerned about human affairs, if he\nwere not the Maker of the world, and no one seriously believes that the\nworld was made by God, who is not persuaded that he takes care of his own\nworks, it is not without reason that David conducts us by a most excellent\nseries from one to the other. In general, indeed, both philosophers teach,\nand the minds of men conceive, that all the parts of the world are\nquickened by the secret inspiration of God. But they go not so far as\nDavid, who is followed by all the pious, when he says, “These all wait\nupon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. That thou\ngivest them, they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are filled with\ngood. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their\nbreath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy Spirit,\nthey are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth.”(413) Though\nthey subscribe to the assertion of Paul, that in God “we live, and move,\nand have our being,”(414) yet they are very far from a serious sense of\nhis favour, celebrated by the Apostle; because they have no apprehension\nof the special care of God, from which alone his paternal favour is known.\nII. For the clearer manifestation of this difference, it must be observed\nthat the providence of God, as it is taught in Scripture, is opposed to\nfortune and fortuitous accidents. Now, since it has been the common\npersuasion in all ages, and is also in the present day almost the\nuniversal opinion, that all things happen fortuitously, it is certain that\nevery correct sentiment concerning providence is not only obscured, but\nalmost buried in oblivion by this erroneous notion. If any one falls into\nthe hands of robbers, or meets with wild beasts; if by a sudden storm he\nis shipwrecked on the ocean; if he is killed by the fall of a house or a\ntree; if another, wandering through deserts, finds relief for his penury,\nor, after having been tossed about by the waves, reaches the port, and\nescapes, as it were, but a hair’s‐breadth from death,—carnal reason will\nascribe all these occurrences, both prosperous and adverse, to fortune.\nBut whoever has been taught from the mouth of Christ, that the hairs of\nhis head are all numbered,(415) will seek further for a cause, and\nconclude that all events are governed by the secret counsel of God. And\nrespecting things inanimate, it must be admitted, that, though they are\nall naturally endued with their peculiar properties, yet they exert not\ntheir power, any further than as they are directed by the present hand of\nGod. They are, therefore, no other than instruments into which God infuses\nas much efficacy as he pleases, bending and turning them to any actions,\naccording to his will. There is no power among all the creatures more\nwonderful or illustrious, than that of the sun. For, besides his\nillumination of the whole world by his splendour, how astonishing it is\nthat he cherishes and enlivens all animals with his heat; with his rays\ninspires fecundity into the earth; from the seeds, genially warmed in her\nbosom, produces a green herbage, which, being supported by fresh\nnourishment, he increases and strengthens till it rises into stalks; feeds\nthem with perpetual exhalations, till they grow into blossoms, and from\nblossoms to fruit, which he then by his influences brings to maturity;\nthat trees, likewise, and vines, by his genial warmth, first put forth\nleaves, then blossoms, and from the blossoms produce their fruit! But the\nLord, to reserve the praise of all these things entirely to himself, was\npleased that the light should exist, and the earth abound in every kind of\nherbs and fruits, before he created the sun. A pious man, therefore, will\nnot make the sun either a principal or necessary cause of those things\nwhich existed before the creation of the sun, but only an instrument which\nGod uses, because it is his pleasure so to do; whereas he would find no\nmore difficulty in acting by himself without that luminary. Lastly, as we\nread that the sun remained in one situation for two days at the prayer of\nJoshua,(416) and that his shadow made a retrograde motion of ten degrees\nfor the sake of king Hezekiah,(417) God has declared by these few\nmiracles, that the daily rising and setting of the sun is not from a blind\ninstinct of nature, but that he himself governs his course, to renew the\nmemory of his paternal favour towards us. Nothing is more natural than the\nsuccession of spring to winter, of summer to spring, and of autumn to\nsummer. But there is so great a diversity and inequality discovered in\nthis series, that it is obvious that every year, month, and day, is\ngoverned by a new and particular providence of God.\nIII. And, indeed, God asserts his possession of omnipotence, and claims\nour acknowledgment of this attribute; not such as is imagined by sophists,\nvain, idle, and almost asleep, but vigilant, efficacious, operative, and\nengaged in continual action; not a mere general principle of confused\nmotion, as if he should command a river to flow through the channels once\nmade for it, but a power constantly exerted on every distinct and\nparticular movement. For he is accounted omnipotent, not because he is\nable to act, yet sits down in idleness, or continues by a general instinct\nthe order of nature originally appointed by him; but because he governs\nheaven and earth by his providence, and regulates all things in such a\nmanner that nothing happens but according to his counsel. For when it is\nsaid in the Psalms, that he does whatsoever he pleases,(418) it denotes\nhis certain and deliberate will. For it would be quite insipid to expound\nthe words of the Prophet in the philosophical manner, that God is the\nprime agent, because he is the principle and cause of all motion; whereas\nthe faithful should rather encourage themselves in adversity with this\nconsolation, that they suffer no affliction, but by the ordination and\ncommand of God, because they are under his hand. But if the government of\nGod be thus extended to all his works, it is a puerile cavil to limit it\nto the influence and course of nature. And they not only defraud God of\nhis glory, but themselves of a very useful doctrine, who confine the\nDivine providence within such narrow bounds, as though he permitted all\nthings to proceed in an uncontrolled course, according to a perpetual law\nof nature; for nothing would exceed the misery of man, if he were exposed\nto all the motions of the heaven, air, earth, and waters. Besides, this\nnotion would shamefully diminish the singular goodness of God towards\nevery individual. David exclaims, that infants yet hanging on the breasts\nof their mothers are sufficiently eloquent to celebrate the glory of\nGod;(419) because, as soon as they are born, they find aliment prepared\nfor them by his heavenly care. This, indeed, is generally true; yet it\ncannot escape the observation of our eyes and senses, being evidently\nproved by experience, that some mothers have breasts full and copious, but\nothers almost dry; as it pleases God to provide more liberally for one,\nbut more sparingly for another. But they who ascribe just praise to the\nDivine omnipotence, receive from this a double advantage. In the first\nplace, he must have ample ability to bless them, who possesses heaven and\nearth, and whose will all the creatures regard so as to devote themselves\nto his service. And, secondly, they may securely repose in his protection,\nto whose will are subject all those evils which can be feared from any\nquarter; by whose power Satan is restrained, with all his furies, and all\nhis machinations; on whose will depends all that is inimical to our\nsafety; nor is there any thing else by which those immoderate and\nsuperstitious fears, which we frequently feel on the sight of dangers, can\nbe corrected or appeased. We are superstitiously timid, I say, if,\nwhenever creatures menace or terrify us, we are frightened, as though they\nhad of themselves the power to hurt us, or could fortuitously injure us;\nor as if against their injuries God were unable to afford us sufficient\naid. For example, the Prophet forbids the children of God to fear the\nstars and signs of heaven,(420) as is the custom of unbelievers. He\ncertainly condemns not every kind of fear. But when infidels transfer the\ngovernment of the world from God to the stars, pretending that their\nhappiness or misery depends on the decrees and presages of the stars, and\nnot on the will of God, the consequence is, that their fear is withdrawn\nfrom him, whom alone they ought to regard, and is placed on stars and\ncomets. Whoever, then, desires to avoid this infidelity, let him\nconstantly remember, that in the creatures there is no erratic power, or\naction, or motion; but that they are so governed by the secret counsel of\nGod, that nothing can happen but what is subject to his knowledge, and\ndecreed by his will.\nIV. First, then, let the readers know that what is called providence\ndescribes God, not as idly beholding from heaven the transactions which\nhappen in the world, but as holding the helm of the universe, and\nregulating all events. Thus it belongs no less to his hands than to his\neyes. When Abraham said to his son, “God will provide,”(421) he intended\nnot only to assert his prescience of a future event, but to leave the care\nof a thing unknown to the will of him who frequently puts an end to\ncircumstances of perplexity and confusion. Whence it follows, that\nprovidence consists in action; for it is ignorant trifling to talk of mere\nprescience. Not quite so gross is the error of those who attribute to God\na government, as I have observed, of a confused and promiscuous kind;\nacknowledging that God revolves and impels the machine of the world, with\nall its parts, by a general motion, without peculiarly directing the\naction of each individual creature. Yet even this error is not to be\ntolerated. For they maintain that this providence, which they call\nuniversal, is no impediment either to all the creatures being actuated\ncontingently, or to man turning himself hither or thither at the free\nchoice of his own will. And they make the following partition between God\nand man; that God by his power inspires him with motions, enabling him to\nact according to the tendency of the nature with which he is endued; but\nthat man governs his actions by his own voluntary choice. In short, they\nconceive, that the world, human affairs, and men themselves, are governed\nby the power of God, but not by his appointment. I speak not of the\nEpicureans, who have always infested the world, who dream of a god\nabsorbed in sloth and inactivity; and of others no less erroneous, who\nformerly pretended that the dominion of God extended over the middle\nregion of the air, but that he left inferior things to fortune; since the\nmute creatures themselves sufficiently exclaim against such evident\nstupidity. My present design is to refute that opinion, which has almost\ngenerally prevailed, which, conceding to God a sort of blind and uncertain\nmotion, deprives him of the principal thing, which is his directing and\ndisposing, by his incomprehensible wisdom, all things to their proper end;\nand thus, robbing God of the government of the world, it makes him the\nruler of it in name only, and not in reality. For, pray, what is\ngoverning, but presiding in such a manner, as to rule, by fixed decrees,\nthose over whom you preside? Yet I reject not altogether what they assert\nconcerning universal providence, provided they, on their part admit that\nGod governs the world, not merely because he preserves the order of nature\nfixed by himself, but because he exercises a peculiar care over every one\nof his works. It is true that all things are actuated by a secret instinct\nof nature, as though they obeyed the eternal command of God, and that what\nGod has once appointed, appears to proceed from voluntary inclination in\nthe creatures. And to this may be referred the declaration of Christ, that\nhis Father and himself had always been working, even from the\nbeginning;(422) and the assertion of Paul, that “in him we live, and move,\nand have our being;”(423) and also what is observed by the author of the\nEpistle to the Hebrews, with a design to prove the Divinity of Christ,\nthat all things are sustained by the word of his power.(424) But they act\nvery improperly in concealing and obscuring, by this pretext, the doctrine\nof a particular providence, which is asserted in such plain and clear\ntestimonies of Scripture, that it is surprising how any one could\nentertain a doubt concerning it. And, certainly, they who conceal it with\nthis veil which I have mentioned, are obliged to correct themselves by\nadding, that many things happen through the peculiar care of God; but this\nthey erroneously restrict to some particular acts. Wherefore we have to\nprove, that God attends to the government of particular events, and that\nthey all proceed from his determinate counsel, in such a manner that there\ncan be no such thing as fortuitous contingence.\nV. If we grant that the principle of motion originates from God, but that\nall things are spontaneously or accidentally carried whither the bias of\nnature impels them, the mutual vicissitudes of day and night, of winter\nand summer, will be the work of God, inasmuch as he has distributed to\neach its respective parts, and prescribed to them a certain law; that is,\nthis would be the case if with even tenor they always observed the same\nmeasure, days succeeding to nights, months to months, and years to years.\nBut sometimes excessive heats and drought parch and burn the fruits of the\nearth; sometimes unseasonable rains injure the crops of corn, and sudden\ncalamities are occasioned by showers of hail and storms: this will not be\nthe work of God; unless, perhaps, as either clouds or serene weather, or\ncold or heat, derive their origin from the opposition of the stars and\nother natural causes. But this representation leaves no room for God to\ndisplay or exercise his paternal favour, or his judgments. If they say\nthat God is sufficiently beneficent to man, because he infuses into heaven\nand earth an ordinary power, by which they supply him with food, it is a\nvery flimsy and profane notion; as though the fecundity of one year were\nnot the singular benediction of God, and as though penury and famine were\nnot his malediction and vengeance. But as it would be tedious to collect\nall the reasons for rejecting this error, let us be content with the\nauthority of God himself. In the law and in the prophets he frequently\ndeclares, that whenever he moistens the earth with dew or with rain, he\naffords a testimony of his favour; and that, on the contrary, when, at his\ncommand, heaven becomes hard as iron, when the crops of corn are blasted\nand otherwise destroyed, and when showers of hail and storms molest the\nfields, he gives a proof of his certain and special vengeance. If we\nbelieve these things, it is certain that not a drop of rain falls but at\nthe express command of God. David indeed praises the general providence of\nGod, because “he giveth food to the young ravens which cry;”(425) but when\nGod himself threatens animals with famine, does he not plainly declare,\nthat he feeds all living creatures, sometimes with a smaller allowance,\nsometimes with a larger, as he pleases? It is puerile, as I have already\nobserved, to restrain this to particular acts; whereas Christ says,\nwithout any exception, that not a sparrow of the least value falls to the\nground without the will of the Father.(426) Certainly, if the flight of\nbirds be directed by the unerring counsel of God, we must be constrained\nto confess with the Prophet, that, though “he dwelleth on high,” yet “he\nhumbleth himself to behold the things which are in heaven and in the\nearth.”(427)\nVI. But as we know that the world was made chiefly for the sake of\nmankind, we must also observe this end in the government of it. The\nProphet Jeremiah exclaims, “I know that the way of man is not in himself:\nit is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.”(428) And Solomon:\n“Man’s goings are of the Lord: how can a man then understand his own\nway?”(429) Now, let them say that man is actuated by God according to the\nbias of his nature, but that he directs that influence according to his\nown pleasure. If this could be asserted with truth, man would have the\nfree choice of his own ways. That, perhaps, they will deny, because he can\ndo nothing independently of the power of God. But since it is evident that\nboth the Prophet and Solomon ascribe to God choice and appointment, as\nwell as power, this by no means extricates them from the difficulty. But\nSolomon, in another place, beautifully reproves this temerity of men, who\npredetermine on an end for themselves, without regard to God, as though\nthey were not led by his hand: “The preparation of the heart in man,” says\nhe, “and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord.”(430) It is, indeed,\na ridiculous madness for miserable men to resolve on undertaking any work\nindependently of God, whilst they cannot even speak a word but what he\nchooses. Moreover, the Scripture, more fully to express that nothing is\ntransacted in the world but according to his destination, shows that those\nthings are subject to him which appear most fortuitous. For what would you\nbe more ready to attribute to chance, than when a limb broken off from a\ntree kills a passing traveller? But very different is the decision of the\nLord, who acknowledges that he has delivered him into the hand of the\nslayer.(431) Who, likewise, does not leave lots to the blindness of\nfortune? Yet the Lord leaves them not, but claims the disposal of them\nhimself. He teaches us that it is not by any power of their own that lots\nare cast into the lap(432) and drawn out; but the only thing which could\nbe ascribed to chance, he declares to belong to himself. To the same\npurpose is another passage from Solomon: “The poor and the deceitful man\nmeet together: the Lord enlighteneth the eyes of them both.”(433) For\nalthough the poor and the rich are blended together in the world, yet, as\ntheir respective conditions are assigned to them by Divine appointment, he\nsuggests that God, who enlightens all, is not blind, and thus exhorts the\npoor to patience; because those who are discontented with their lot, are\nendeavouring to shake off the burden imposed on them by God. Thus also\nanother Prophet rebukes profane persons, who attribute it to human\nindustry, or to fortune, that some men remain in obscurity, and others\nrise to honours: “Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the\nwest, nor from the south. But God is the Judge; he putteth down one, and\nsetteth up another.”(434) Since God cannot divest himself of the office of\na judge, hence he reasons, that it is from the secret counsel of God, that\nsome rise to promotion, and others remain in contempt.\nVII. Moreover, particular events are in general proofs of the special\nprovidence of God. God raised in the desert a south wind, to convey to the\npeople a large flock of birds.(435) When he would have Jonah thrown into\nthe sea, he sent forth a wind to raise a tempest.(436) It will be said by\nthem who suppose God not to hold the helm of the world, that this was a\ndeviation from the common course of things. But the conclusion which I\ndeduce from it is, that no wind ever rises or blows but by the special\ncommand of God. For otherwise it would not be true that he makes the winds\nhis messengers, and a flame of fire his ministers, that he makes the\nclouds his chariot, and rides on the wings of the wind,(437) unless he\ndirected at his pleasure the course both of the clouds and of the winds,\nand displayed in them the singular presence of his power. Thus also we are\nelsewhere taught, that, whenever the sea is blown into a tempest by the\nwinds, those commotions prove the special presence of God. “He commandeth\nand raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves” of the sea. “Then\nhe maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still;”(438) as\nin another place he proclaims, that he scourged the people with parching\nwinds.(439) Thus, whilst men are naturally endued with a power of\ngeneration, yet God will have it acknowledged as the effect of his special\nfavour, that he leaves some without any posterity, and bestows children on\nothers; for “the fruit of the womb is his reward.”(440) Therefore Jacob\nsaid to his wife, “Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the\nfruit of the womb?”(441) But to conclude; there is nothing more common in\nnature, than for us to be nourished with bread. But the Spirit declares,\nnot only that the produce of the earth is the special gift of God, but\nthat men do not live by bread alone;(442) because they are supported not\nby the abundance of their food, but by the secret benediction of God; as,\non the contrary, he threatens that he will break “the stay of bread.”(443)\nNor, indeed, could we otherwise seriously offer a prayer for daily bread,\nif God did not supply us with food from his fatherly hand. The Prophet,\ntherefore, to convince the faithful that in feeding them God acts the part\nof an excellent father of a family, informs us, that he “giveth food to\nall flesh.”(444) Lastly, when we hear, on the one hand, that “the eyes of\nthe Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry,”\nand, on the other, that “the face of the Lord is against them that do\nevil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth,”(445) we may be\nassured that all creatures, above and below, are ready for his service,\nthat he may apply them to any use that he pleases. Hence we conclude, not\nonly that there is a general providence of God over the creatures, to\ncontinue the order of nature, but that, by his wonderful counsel, they are\nall directed to some specific and proper end.\nVIII. Those who wish to bring an odium on this doctrine, calumniate it as\nthe same with the opinion of the Stoics concerning fate, with which\nAugustine also was formerly reproached. Though we are averse to all\ncontentions about words, yet we admit not the term _fate_; both because it\nis of that novel and profane kind which Paul teaches us to avoid, and\nbecause they endeavour to load the truth of God with the odium attached to\nit. But that dogma is falsely and maliciously charged upon us. For we do\nnot, with the Stoics, imagine a necessity arising from a perpetual\nconcatenation and intricate series of causes, contained in nature; but we\nmake God the Arbiter and Governor of all things, who, in his own wisdom,\nhas, from the remotest eternity, decreed what he would do, and now, by his\nown power, executes what he has decreed. Whence we assert, that not only\nthe heaven and the earth, and inanimate creatures, but also the\ndeliberations and volitions of men, are so governed by his providence, as\nto be directed to the end appointed by it. What then? you will say; does\nnothing happen fortuitously or contingently? I answer, that it was truly\nobserved by Basil the Great, that _fortune_ and _chance_ are words of the\nheathen, with the signification of which the minds of the pious ought not\nto be occupied. For if all success be the benediction of God, and calamity\nand adversity his malediction, there is no room left in human affairs for\nfortune or chance. And we should attend to this declaration of Augustine:\n“I am not pleased with myself,” says he, “for having, in my treatises\nagainst the Academics, so frequently mentioned _fortune_, although I have\nnot intended by that word any goddess, but a fortuitous occurrence of\nexternal things, either good or evil. Hence also such words, the use of\nwhich no religion prohibits, as _perhaps_, _perchance_, _peradventure_,\nwhich, nevertheless, must be entirely referred to the Divine providence.\nAnd on this I have not been silent, remarking that perhaps what is\ncommonly termed _fortune_ is regulated by a secret order, and that what we\ncall _chance_ is only that, with the reason and cause of which we are not\nacquainted. Thus, indeed, I have expressed myself; but I repent of having\nmentioned _fortune_ in this manner, since I see that men are habituated to\na very sinful custom: when they ought to say, ‘This was the will of God,’\nthey say, ‘This was the will of Fortune.’ ” Finally, he every where\nmaintains, that if any thing be left to fortune, the world revolves at\nrandom. And though he elsewhere decides, that all things are conducted\npartly by the free will of man, partly by the providence of God, yet he\njust after shows that men are subject to it and governed by it, assuming\nas a principle that nothing could be more absurd, than for any thing to\nhappen independently of the ordination of God; because it would happen at\nrandom. By this reasoning he excludes also any contingence dependent on\nthe human will; and immediately after more expressly asserts that we ought\nnot to inquire for any cause of the will of God. But in what sense\n_permission_ ought to be understood, whenever it is mentioned by him, will\nappear from one passage; where he proves that the will of God is the\nsupreme and first cause of all things, because nothing happens but by his\ncommand or permission. He certainly does not suppose God to remain an idle\nspectator, determining to permit any thing; there is an intervention of\nactual volition, if I may be allowed the expression, which otherwise could\nnever be considered as a cause.\nIX. Yet, since the dulness of our minds is very much below the sublimity\nof the Divine providence, let us endeavour to assist them by a\ndistinction. I say, then, that, notwithstanding the ordination of all\nthings by the certain purpose and direction of God, yet to us they are\nfortuitous: not that we suppose fortune holds any dominion over the world\nand mankind, and whirls about all things at random, for such folly ought\nto be far from the breast of a Christian; but because the order, reason,\nend, and necessity of events are chiefly concealed in the purpose of God,\nand not comprehended by the mind of man, those things are in some measure\nfortuitous, which must certainly happen according to the Divine will. For\nthey present no other appearance, whether they are considered in their own\nnature, or are estimated according to our knowledge and judgment. Let us\nsuppose, for example, that a merchant, having entered a wood in the\ncompany of honest men, imprudently wanders from his companions, and,\npursuing a wrong course, falls into the hands of robbers, and is murdered.\nHis death was not only foreseen by God, but also decreed by him. For it is\nsaid, not that he has foreseen to what limits the life of every man would\nextend, but that he “hath appointed bounds which he cannot pass.”(446)\nYet, as far as our minds are capable of comprehending, all these\ncircumstances appear fortuitous. What opinion shall a Christian form on\nthis case? He will consider all the circumstances of such a death as in\ntheir nature fortuitous; yet he will not doubt that the providence of God\npresided, and directed fortune to that end. The same reasoning will apply\nto future contingencies. All future things being uncertain to us, we hold\nthem in suspense, as though they might happen either one way or another.\nYet this remains a fixed principle in our hearts, that there will be no\nevent which God has not ordained. In this sense the word _chance_ is\nfrequently repeated in the book of Ecclesiastes; because, on the first\nview, men penetrate not to the first cause, which lies deeply concealed.\nAnd yet the doctrine of the Scripture respecting the secret providence of\nGod, has never been so far obliterated from the hearts of men, but that\nsome sparks of it always shone in the darkness. Thus the Philistine\nsorcerers, though they fluctuated in uncertainty, ascribed adverse\naccidents partly to God, partly to fortune. “If the ark,” say they, “goeth\nup by that way, we shall know that God hath done us this great evil; but\nif not, it was a chance that happened to us.”(447) They betrayed great\nfolly, indeed, after having been deceived by divination, to have recourse\nto fortune; yet at the same time, we see them restrained, so that they\ncannot dare to suppose the affliction which had befallen them was\nfortuitous. But how God, by the reins of his providence, directs all\nevents according to his own pleasure, will appear by an eminent example.\nAt the very same instant of time when David had been overtaken in the\nwilderness of Maon, behold, the Philistines made an irruption into the\nland, and Saul was compelled to depart. If God, consulting the safety of\nhis servant, laid this impediment in the way of Saul, then, surely, though\nthe Philistines might have taken up arms suddenly, and contrary to human\nexpectation, yet we will not say that this happened by chance; but what to\nus seems a contingency, faith will acknowledge to have been a secret\nimpulse of God. It is not always, indeed, that there appears a similar\nreason; but it should be considered as indubitably certain, that all the\nrevolutions visible in the world proceed from the secret exertion of the\nDivine power. What God decrees, must necessarily come to pass; yet it is\nnot by absolute or natural necessity. We find a familiar example in\nrespect to the bones of Christ. Since he possessed a body like ours, no\nreasonable man will deny that his bones were capable of being broken; yet\nthat they should be broken was impossible. Hence, again, we perceive that\nthe distinctions of relative and absolute necessity, as well as necessity\nof consequent and of consequence, were not without reason invented in the\nschools; since God made the bones of his Son capable of being broken,\nwhich, however, he had exempted from being actually broken, and thus\nprevented, by the necessity of his purpose, what might naturally have come\nto pass."

          "title": "Chapter XVII. The Proper Application Of This Doctrine To Render It Useful",
          "content": "To Us.\nAs the minds of men are prone to vain subtleties, there is the greatest\ndanger that those who know not the right use of this doctrine will\nembarrass themselves with intricate perplexities. It will therefore be\nnecessary to touch in a brief manner on the end and design of the\nScripture doctrine of the Divine ordination of all things. And here let it\nbe remarked, in the first place, that the providence of God is to be\nconsidered as well in regard to futurity, as in reference to that which is\npast; secondly, that it governs all things in such a manner as to operate\nsometimes by the intervention of means, sometimes without means, and\nsometimes in opposition to all means; lastly, that it tends to show the\ncare of God for the whole human race, and especially his vigilance in the\ngovernment of the Church, which he favours with more particular attention.\nIt must also be observed, that, although the paternal favour and\nbeneficence of God, or the severity of his justice, is frequently\nconspicuous in the whole course of his providence, yet sometimes the\ncauses of events are concealed, so that a suspicion intrudes itself, that\nthe revolutions of human affairs are conducted by the blind impetuosity of\nfortune; or the flesh solicits us to murmur, as though God amused himself\nwith tossing men about like tennis‐balls. It is true, indeed, if we were\nready to learn with quiet and sober minds, that the final issue\nsufficiently proves the counsels of God to be directed by the best of\nreasons; that he designs either to teach his people the exercise of\npatience, or to correct their corrupt affections and subdue the\nlicentiousness of their appetites, or to constrain them to the practice of\nself‐denial, or to arouse them from their indolence; and, on the other\nhand, to abase the proud, to disappoint the cunning of the wicked, and to\nconfound their machinations. Yet, however the causes may be concealed from\nus, or escape our observation, we must admit it as a certain truth, that\nthey are hidden with him; and must therefore exclaim with David, “Many, O\nLord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy\nthoughts which are to us‐ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto\nthee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be\nnumbered.”(448) For, though our miseries ought always to remind us of our\nsins, that the punishment itself may urge us to repentance, yet we see\nthat Christ ascribes more sovereignty to the secret purpose of the Father\nin afflicting men, than to require him to punish every individual\naccording to his demerits. For concerning him who was born blind, he says,\n“Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God\nshould be made manifest in him.”(449) For here sense murmurs, when\ncalamity precedes the very birth, as though it were a detraction from the\nDivine clemency thus to afflict the innocent. But Christ declares that the\nglory of his Father is manifested in this instance, provided our eyes are\nclear to behold it. But we must proceed with modesty, cautious that we\ncall not God to an account at our tribunal; but that we entertain such\nreverence for his secret judgments, as to esteem his will the most\nrighteous cause of every thing that he does. When thick clouds obscure the\nheavens, and a violent tempest arises, because a gloomy mist is before our\neyes, and thunder strikes our ears, and terror stupefies all our\nfaculties, all things seem to us to be blended in confusion; yet during\nthe whole time the heavens remain in the same quiet serenity. So it must\nbe concluded, that while the turbulent state of the world deprives us of\nour judgment, God, by the pure light of his own righteousness and wisdom,\nregulates all those commotions in the most exact order, and directs them\nto their proper end. And certainly the madness of many in this respect is\nmonstrous, who dare to arraign the works of God, to scrutinize his secret\ncounsels, and even to pass a precipitate sentence on things unknown, with\ngreater freedom than on the actions of mortal men. For what is more\npreposterous than towards our equals to observe such modesty, as rather to\nsuspend our judgment than to incur the imputation of temerity, but\nimpudently to insult the mysterious judgments of God, which we ought to\nhold in admiration and reverence?\nII. None, therefore, will attain just and profitable views of the\nprovidence of God, but he who considers that he has to do with his Maker\nand the Creator of the world, and submits himself to fear and reverence\nwith all becoming humility. Hence it happens that so many worthless\ncharacters in the present day virulently oppose this doctrine, because\nthey will admit nothing to be lawful for God, but what agrees with the\ndictates of their own reason. They revile us with the utmost possible\nimpudence, because, not content with the precepts of the law, which\ncomprehend the will of God, we say that the world is governed also by his\nsecret counsels; as though, indeed, what we assert were only an invention\nof our own brain, and the Holy Spirit did not every where plainly announce\nthe same, and repeat it in innumerable forms of expression. But as they\nare restrained by some degree of shame from daring to discharge their\nblasphemies against heaven, in order to indulge their extravagance with\ngreater freedom, they pretend that they are contending with us. But unless\nthey admit, that whatever comes to pass in the world is governed by the\nincomprehensible counsel of God, let them answer, to what purpose is it\nsaid in the Scripture that his “judgments are a great deep”?(450) For\nsince Moses proclaims, that the will of God is not to be sought far off,\nin the clouds or in the deep,(451) because it is familiarly explained in\nthe law, it follows that there is another secret will, which is compared\nto a profound abyss; concerning which Paul also says, “O the depth of the\nriches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God; how unsearchable are his\njudgments, and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of\nthe Lord, or who hath been his counsellor?”(452) It is true, that the law\nand the Gospel contain mysteries which far transcend our capacities; but\nsince God illuminates the minds of his people with the spirit of\nunderstanding, to apprehend these mysteries which he has condescended to\nreveal in his word, there we have now no abyss, but a way in which we may\nsafely walk, and a lamp for the direction of our feet, the light of life,\nand the school of certain and evident truth. But his admirable method of\ngoverning the world is justly called a “great deep,” because, while it is\nconcealed from our view, it ought to be the object of our profound\nadoration. Moses has beautifully expressed both in a few words. “The\nsecret things,” says he, “belong unto the Lord our God; but those things\nwhich are revealed belong unto us and to our children.”(453) We see how he\nenjoins us, not only to devote our attention to meditations on the law of\nGod, but to look up with reverence to his mysterious providence. This\nsublime doctrine is declared in the book of Job, for the purpose of\nhumbling our minds. For the author concludes a general view of the machine\nof the world, and a magnificent dissertation on the works of God, in these\nwords: “Lo, these are parts of his ways; but how little a portion is heard\nof him!”(454) For which reason, in another place he distinguishes between\nthe wisdom which resides in God, and the method of attaining wisdom which\nhe has prescribed to men. For, after discoursing concerning the secrets of\nnature, he says, that wisdom is known only to God, and “is hid from the\neyes of all living.” But a little after he subjoins, that it is published\nin order to be investigated, because it is said to men, “Behold the fear\nof the Lord, that is wisdom.”(455) To the same purpose is this observation\nof Augustine: “Because we know not all that God does concerning us by an\nexcellent order we act according to the law in a good will only, but in\nother respects are actuated according to it; because his providence is an\nimmutable law.” Therefore, since God claims a power unknown to us of\ngoverning the world, let this be to us the law of sobriety and modesty, to\nacquiesce in his supreme dominion, to account his will the only rule of\nrighteousness, and most righteous cause of all things. Not, indeed, that\nabsolute will which is the subject of the declamation of sophists,\nimpiously and profanely separating his justice from his power, but that\nprovidence which governs all things, from which originates nothing but\nwhat is right, although the reasons of it may be concealed from us.\nIII. Those who have learned this modesty, will neither murmur against God\non account of past adversities, nor charge him with the guilt of their\ncrimes, like Agamemnon, in Homer, who says, “The blame belongs not to me,\nbut to Jupiter and Fate.” Nor will they, as if hurried away by the Fates,\nunder the influence of despair, put an end to their own lives, like the\nyoung man whom Plautus introduces as saying, “The condition of our affairs\nis inconstant; men are governed by the caprice of the Fates; I will betake\nmyself to a precipice, and there destroy my life and every thing at once.”\nNor will they excuse their flagitious actions by ascribing them to God,\nafter the example of another young man introduced by the same poet, who\nsays, “God was the cause: I believe it was the Divine will. For had it not\nbeen so, I know it would not have happened.” But they will rather search\nthe Scripture, to learn what is pleasing to God, that by the guidance of\nthe Spirit they may strive to attain it; and at the same time, being\nprepared to follow God whithersoever he calls them, they will exhibit\nproofs in their conduct that nothing is more useful than a knowledge of\nthis doctrine. Some profane men foolishly raise such a tumult with their\nabsurdities, as almost, according to a common expression, to confound\nheaven and earth together. They argue in this manner: If God has fixed the\nmoment of our death, we cannot avoid it; therefore all caution against it\nwill be but lost labour. One man dares not venture himself in a way which\nhe hears is dangerous, lest he should be assassinated by robbers; another\nsends for physicians, and wearies himself with medicines, to preserve his\nlife; another abstains from the grosser kinds of food, lest he should\ninjure his valetudinary constitution; another dreads to inhabit a ruinous\nhouse; and men in general exert all their faculties in devising and\nexecuting methods by which they may attain the object of their desires.\nNow, either all these things are vain remedies employed to correct the\nwill of God, or life and death, health and disease, peace and war, and\nother things which, according to their desires or aversions, men\nindustriously study to obtain or to avoid, are not determined by his\ncertain decree. Moreover they conclude, that the prayers of the faithful\nare not only superfluous, but perverse, which contain petitions that the\nLord will provide for those things which he has already decreed from\neternity. In short, they supersede all deliberations respecting futurity,\nas opposed to the providence of God, who, without consulting men, has\ndecreed whatever he pleased. And what has already happened they impute to\nthe Divine providence in such a manner as to overlook the person, who is\nknown to have committed any particular act. Has an assassin murdered a\nworthy citizen? they say he has executed the counsel of God. Has any one\nbeen guilty of theft or fornication? because he has done what was foreseen\nand ordained by the Lord, he is the minister of his providence. Has a son,\nneglecting all remedies, carelessly waited the death of his father? it was\nimpossible for him to resist God, who had decreed this event from\neternity. Thus by these persons all crimes are denominated virtues,\nbecause they are subservient to the ordination of God.\nIV. But in reference to future things, Solomon easily reconciles the\ndeliberations of men with the providence of God. For as he ridicules the\nfolly of those who presumptuously undertake any thing without the Lord, as\nthough they were not subject to his government, so in another place he\nsays, “A man’s heart deviseth his way; but the Lord directeth his\nsteps;”(456) signifying that the eternal decrees of God form no impediment\nto our providing for ourselves, and disposing all our concerns in\nsubservience to his will. The reason of this is manifest. For he who has\nfixed the limits of our life, has also intrusted us with the care of it;\nhas furnished us with means and supplies for its preservation; has also\nmade us provident of dangers; and, that they may not oppress us unawares,\nhas furnished us with cautions and remedies. Now, it is evident what is\nour duty. If God has committed to us the preservation of our life, we\nshould preserve it; if he offers supplies, we should use them; if he\nforewarns us of dangers, we should not rashly run into them; if he\nfurnishes remedies, we ought not to neglect them. But it will be objected,\nno danger can hurt, unless it has been ordained that it shall hurt us, and\nthen no remedies can avert it. But what if dangers are therefore not\nfatal, because God has assigned you remedies to repulse and overcome them?\nExamine whether your reasoning agrees with the order of the Divine\nprovidence. You conclude that it is unnecessary to guard against danger,\nbecause, if it be not fatal, we shall escape it without caution; but, on\nthe contrary, the Lord enjoins you to use caution, because he intends it\nnot to be fatal to you. These madmen overlook what is obvious to every\nobserver—that the arts of deliberation and caution in men proceed from the\ninspiration of God, and that they subserve the designs of his providence\nin the preservation of their own lives; as, on the contrary, by neglect\nand slothfulness, they procure to themselves the evils which he has\nappointed for them. For how does it happen, that a prudent man, consulting\nhis own welfare, averts from himself impending evils, and a fool is ruined\nby his inconsiderate temerity, unless folly and prudence are in both cases\ninstruments of the Divine dispensation? Therefore it has pleased God to\nconceal from us all future events, that we may meet them as doubtful\ncontingencies, and not cease to oppose to them the remedies with which we\nare provided, till they shall have been surmounted, or shall have overcome\nall our diligence. Therefore I have before suggested, that the providence\nof God ought not always to be contemplated abstractedly by itself, but in\nconnection with the means which he employs.\nV. The same persons inconsiderately and erroneously ascribe all past\nevents to the absolute providence of God. For since all things which come\nto pass are dependent upon it, therefore, say they, neither thefts, nor\nadulteries, nor homicides, are perpetrated without the intervention of the\nDivine will. Why, therefore, they ask, shall a thief be punished for\nhaving pillaged him whom it has pleased the Lord to chastise with poverty?\nWhy shall a homicide be punished for having slain him whose life the Lord\nhad terminated? If all such characters are subservient to the Divine will,\nwhy shall they be punished? But I deny that they serve the will of God.\nFor we cannot say, that he who is influenced by a wicked heart, acts in\nobedience to the commands of God, while he is only gratifying his own\nmalignant passions. That man obeys God, who, being instructed in his will,\nhastens whither God calls him. Where can we learn his will, but in his\nword? Therefore in our actions we ought to regard the will of God, which\nis declared in his word. God only requires of us conformity to his\nprecepts. If we do any thing contrary to them, it is not obedience, but\ncontumacy and transgression. But it is said, if he would not permit it, we\nshould not do it. This I grant. But do we perform evil actions with the\ndesign of pleasing him? He gives us no such command. We precipitate\nourselves into them, not considering what is his will, but inflamed with\nthe violence of our passions, so that we deliberately strive to oppose\nhim. In this manner even by criminal actions we subserve his righteous\nordination; because, in the infinite greatness of his wisdom, he well\nknows how to use evil instruments for the accomplishment of good purposes.\nNow, observe the absurdity of their reasoning: they wish the authors of\ncrimes to escape with impunity, because crimes are not perpetrated but by\nthe ordination of God. I admit more than this; even that thieves, and\nhomicides, and other malefactors, are instruments of Divine providence,\nwhom the Lord uses for the execution of the judgments which he has\nappointed. But I deny that this ought to afford any excuse for their\ncrimes. For will they either implicate God in the same iniquity with\nthemselves, or cover their depravity with his righteousness? They can do\nneither. They are prevented from exculpating themselves, by the reproofs\nof their own consciences; and they can lay no blame upon God, for they\nfind in themselves nothing but evil, and in him only a legitimate use of\ntheir wickedness. But it is alleged that he operates by their means. And\nwhence, I ask, proceeds the fetid smell of a carcass, which has been\nputrefied and disclosed by the heat of the sun? It is visible to all that\nit is excited by the solar rays; yet no person on this account attributes\nto those rays an offensive smell. So, when the matter and guilt of evil\nresides in a bad man, why should God be supposed to contract any\ndefilement, if he uses his service according to his own pleasure? Let us\ndismiss this petulance, therefore, which may rail against the justice of\nGod from a distance, but can never reach that Divine attribute.\nVI. But these cavils, or rather extravagancies of frenzy, will easily be\ndispelled by the pious and holy contemplation of providence, which the\nrule of piety dictates to us, so that we may derive from it the greatest\npleasure and advantage. The mind of a Christian, therefore, when it is\ncertainly persuaded that all things happen by the ordination of God, and\nthat there is nothing fortuitously contingent, will always direct its\nviews to him as the supreme cause of all things, and will also consider\ninferior causes in their proper order. He will not doubt that the\nparticular providence of God is watchful for his preservation, never\npermitting any event which it will not overrule for his advantage and\nsafety. But, since he is concerned in the first place with men, and in the\nnext place with the other creatures, he will assure himself, as to both,\nthat the providence of God reigns over all. With respect to men, whether\ngood or evil, he will acknowledge that their deliberations, wills,\nendeavours, and powers, are under his control, so that it is at his option\nto direct them whithersoever he pleases, and to restrain them as often as\nhe pleases. The vigilance of the particular providence of God for the\nsafety of the faithful is attested by numerous and very remarkable\npromises: “Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he\nshall never suffer the righteous to be moved.(457) He that dwelleth in the\nsecret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the\nAlmighty.(458) He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye. We\nhave a strong city: salvation will God appoint for walls and\nbulwarks.(459) Though a woman forget her sucking child, yet will I not\nforget thee.”(460) Moreover, this is the principal scope of the Biblical\nhistories, to teach us that the Lord so sedulously defends the ways of the\nsaints, that they may not even “dash their foot against a stone.”(461)\nTherefore, as we have a little before justly exploded the opinion of those\nwho hold a universal providence of God, which descends not to the care of\nevery creature in particular, so it is principally necessary and useful to\ncontemplate this special care towards ourselves. For this reason, Christ,\nafter having asserted that not the meanest sparrow falls to the ground\nwithout the will of the Father,(462) immediately makes the following\napplication—that the more we exceed the value of sparrows, the greater\ncare we should consider God as exercising over us; and he carries this to\nsuch an extent, that we may be confident that the hairs of our head are\nnumbered. What more can we desire for ourselves, if not a single hair can\nfall from our head, but according to his will? I speak not exclusively of\nthe human race; but since God has chosen the Church for his habitation,\nthere is no doubt but he particularly displays his paternal care in the\ngovernment of it.\nVII. The servant of God, encouraged by these promises and examples, will\nadd the testimonies, which inform us that all men are subject to his\npower, either to conciliate their minds in our favour, or to restrain\ntheir malice from being injurious. For it is the Lord who gives us favour,\nnot only with our friends, but also in the eyes of the Egyptians;(463) and\nhe knows how to subdue, by various methods, the fury of our enemies.\nSometimes he deprives them of understanding, so that they can form no\nsober or prudent plans; as he sent Satan to fill the mouths of all the\nprophets with falsehood, in order to deceive Ahab:(464) he infatuated\nRehoboam by the counsel of the young men, that through his own folly he\nmight be spoiled of his kingdom.(465) Sometimes, when he grants them\nunderstanding, he so terrifies and dispirits them, that they can neither\ndetermine nor undertake what they have conceived. Sometimes, also, when he\nhas permitted them to attempt what their rage and passion prompted, he\nopportunely breaks their impetuosity, not suffering them to proceed to the\naccomplishment of their designs. Thus he prematurely defeated the counsel\nof Ahithophel, which would have been fatal to David.(466) Thus, also, he\ntakes care to govern all creatures for the benefit and safety of his\npeople, even the devil himself, who, we see, dared not to attempt any\nthing against Job, without his permission and command.(467) The necessary\nconsequences of this knowledge are, gratitude in prosperity, patience in\nadversity, and a wonderful security respecting the future. Every\nprosperous and pleasing event, therefore, the pious man will ascribe\nentirely to God, whether his beneficence be received through the ministry\nof men, or by the assistance of inanimate creatures. For this will be the\nreflection of his mind: “It is certainly the Lord that has inclined their\nhearts to favour me, that has united them to me to be the instruments of\nhis benignity towards me.” In an abundance of the fruits of the earth, he\nwill consider, that it is the Lord who regards the heaven, that the heaven\nmay regard the earth, that the earth, also, may regard its own\nproductions: in other things he will not doubt that it is the Divine\nbenediction alone which is the cause of all prosperity; nor will he bear\nto be ungrateful after so many admonitions.\nVIII. If any adversity befall him, in this case, also, he will immediately\nlift up his heart to God, whose hand is most capable of impressing us with\npatience and placid moderation of mind. If Joseph had dwelt on a review of\nthe perfidy of his brethren, he never could have recovered his fraternal\naffection for them. But as he turned his mind to the Lord, he forgot their\ninjuries, and was so inclined to mildness and clemency, as even\nvoluntarily to administer consolation to them, saying, “It was not you\nthat sent me hither, but God did send me before you to save your lives. Ye\nthought evil against me; but God meant it unto good.”(468) If Job had\nregarded the Chaldeans, by whom he was molested, he had been inflamed to\nrevenge; but recognizing the event at the same time as the work of the\nLord, he consoled himself with this very beautiful observation: “The Lord\ngave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.”(469)\nThus David, when assailed by Shimei with reproachful language and with\nstones, if he had confined his views to man, would have animated his\nsoldiers to retaliate the injury; but understanding that it was not done\nwithout the instigation of the Lord, he rather appeases them: “Let him\ncurse,” says he, “because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David.”(470)\nIn another place he imposes the same restraint on the intemperance of his\ngrief: “I was dumb,” says he, “I opened not my mouth; because thou didst\nit.”(471) If there be no more efficacious remedy for anger and impatience,\nsurely that man has made no small proficiency, who has learned in this\ncase to meditate on the Divine providence, that he may be able at all\ntimes to recall his mind to this consideration: “It is the will of the\nLord, therefore it must be endured; not only because resistance is\nunlawful and vain, but because he wills nothing but what is both just and\nexpedient.” The conclusion of the whole is this—that, when we suffer\ninjuries from men, forgetting their malice, which would only exasperate\nour grief and instigate our minds to revenge, we should remember to ascend\nto God, and learn to account it a certain truth, that whatever our enemies\nhave criminally committed against us, has been permitted and directed by\nhis righteous dispensation. To restrain us from retaliating injuries, Paul\nprudently admonishes us that our contention is not with flesh and blood,\nbut with a spiritual enemy, the devil,(472) in order that we may prepare\nourselves for the contest. But this admonition is the most useful in\nappeasing all the sallies of resentment, that God arms for the conflict\nboth the devil and all wicked men, and sits himself as the arbiter of the\ncombat, to exercise our patience. But if the calamities and miseries which\noppress us happen without the interposition of men, let us recollect the\ndoctrine of the law, that every prosperous event proceeds from the\nbenediction of God, but that all adverse ones are his maledictions;(473)\nand let us tremble at that awful denunciation, “If ye will walk contrary\nunto me, then will I also walk contrary unto you;”(474) language which\nreproves our stupidity, while, according to the common apprehensions of\nthe flesh, esteeming every event, both prosperous and adverse, to be\nfortuitous, we are neither animated to the worship of God by his benefits,\nnor stimulated to repentance by his corrections. This is the reason of the\nsharp expostulations of Jeremiah and of Amos,(475) because the Jews\nsupposed that both good and evil events came to pass without any\nappointment of God. To the same purpose is this passage of Isaiah: “I form\nthe light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord\ndo all these things.”(476)\nIX. Yet at the same time a pious man will not overlook inferior causes.\nNor, because he accounts those from whom he has received any benefit, the\nministers of the Divine goodness, will he therefore pass them by\nunnoticed, as though they deserved no thanks for their kindness; but will\nfeel, and readily acknowledge, his obligation to them, and study to return\nit as ability and opportunity may permit. Finally, he will reverence and\npraise God as the principal Author of benefits received, but will honour\nmen as his ministers; and will understand, what, indeed, is the fact, that\nthe will of God has laid him under obligations to those persons by whose\nmeans the Lord has been pleased to communicate his benefits. If he suffer\nany loss either through negligence or through imprudence, he will conclude\nthat it happened according to the Divine will, but will also impute the\nblame of it to himself. If any one be removed by disease, whom, while it\nwas his duty to take care of him, he has treated with neglect,—though he\ncannot be ignorant that that person had reached those limits which it was\nimpossible for him to pass, yet he will not make this a plea to extenuate\nhis guilt; but, because he has not faithfully performed his duty towards\nhim, will consider him as having perished through his criminal negligence.\nMuch less, when fraud and preconceived malice appear in the perpetration\neither of murder or of theft, will he excuse those enormities under the\npretext of the Divine providence: in the same crime he will distinctly\ncontemplate the righteousness of God and the iniquity of man, as they\nrespectively discover themselves. But it is principally in regard to\nthings future that he will direct his attention to inferior causes of this\nkind. For he will rank it among the blessings of the Lord, not to be\ndestitute of human aids which he may use for his own safety; he will\nneither be remiss, therefore, in taking the advice, nor negligent in\nimploring the help, of those whom he perceives to be capable of affording\nhim assistance; but, considering all the creatures, that can in any\nrespect be serviceable to him, as so many gifts from the Lord, he will use\nthem as the legitimate instruments of the Divine providence. And as he is\nuncertain respecting the issue of his undertakings, except that he knows\nthat the Lord will in all things provide for his good, he studiously aims\nat what, according to the best judgment he can form, will be for his\nadvantage. Nor, in conducting his deliberations, will he be carried away\nby his own opinion, but will recommend and resign himself to the wisdom of\nGod, that he may be directed by its guidance to the right end. But he will\nnot place his confidence in external helps to such a degree as, if\npossessed of them, securely to rely on them, or, if destitute of them, to\ntremble with despair. For his mind will always be fixed solely on the\nDivine providence, nor will he suffer himself to be seduced from a steady\ncontemplation of it, by any consideration of present things. Thus Joab,\nthough he acknowledges the event of battle to depend on the will and the\npower of God, yet surrenders not himself to inactivity, but sedulously\nexecutes all the duties of his office, and leaves the event to the Divine\ndecision. “Let us play the men,” says he, “for our people, and for the\ncities of our God; and the Lord do that which seemeth him good.”(477) This\nknowledge will divest us of temerity and false confidence, and excite us\nto continual invocations of God; it will also support our minds with a\ngood hope, that without hesitation we may securely and magnanimously\ndespise all the dangers which surround us.\nX. Herein is discovered the inestimable felicity of the pious mind. Human\nlife is beset by innumerable evils, and threatened with a thousand deaths.\nNot to go beyond ourselves,—since our body is the receptacle of a thousand\ndiseases, and even contains and fosters the causes of diseases, a man must\nunavoidably carry about with him destruction in unnumbered forms, and\nprotract a life which is, as it were, involved in death. For what else can\nyou say of it, when neither cold nor heat in any considerable degree can\nbe endured without danger? Now, whithersoever you turn, all the objects\naround you are not only unworthy of your confidence, but almost openly\nmenace you, and seem to threaten immediate death. Embark in a ship; there\nis but a single step between you and death. Mount a horse; the slipping of\none foot endangers your life. Walk through the streets of a city; you are\nliable to as many dangers as there are tiles on the roofs. If there be a\nsharp weapon in your hand, or that of your friend, the mischief is\nmanifest. All the ferocious animals you see are armed for your\ndestruction. If you endeavour to shut yourself in a garden surrounded with\na good fence, and exhibiting nothing but what is delightful, even there\nsometimes lurks a serpent. Your house, perpetually liable to fire, menaces\nyou by day with poverty, and by night with falling on your head. Your\nland, exposed to hail, frost, drought, and various tempests, threatens you\nwith sterility, and with its attendant, famine. I omit poison, treachery,\nrobbery, and open violence, which partly beset us at home, and partly\npursue us abroad. Amidst these difficulties, must not man be most\nmiserable, who is half dead while he lives, and is dispirited and alarmed\nas though he had a sword perpetually applied to his neck? You will say\nthat these things happen seldom, or certainly not always, nor to every\nman, but never all at once. I grant it; but as we are admonished by the\nexamples of others, that it is possible for them to happen also to us, and\nthat we have no more claim to exemption from them than others, we must\nunavoidably dread them as events that we may expect. What can you imagine\nmore calamitous than such a dread? Besides, it is an insult to God to say\nthat he has exposed man, the noblest of his creatures, to the blindness\nand temerity of fortune. But here I intend to speak only of the misery\nwhich man must feel, if he be subject to the dominion of fortune.\nXI. On the contrary, when this light of Divine providence has once shined\non a pious man, he is relieved and delivered not only from the extreme\nanxiety and dread with which he was previously oppressed, but also from\nall care. For, as he justly dreads fortune, so he ventures securely to\ncommit himself to God. This, I say, is his consolation, to apprehend that\nhis heavenly Father restrains all things by his power, governs all things\nby his will, and regulates all things by his wisdom, in such a manner,\nthat nothing can happen but by his appointment; moreover, that God has\ntaken him under his protection, and committed him to the care of angels,\nso that he can sustain no injury from water, or fire, or sword, any\nfurther than the Divine Governor may be pleased to permit. For thus sings\nthe Psalmist: “Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,\nand from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers,\nand under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and\nbuckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the\narrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness;\nnor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.”(478) Hence also proceeds\nthat confidence of glorying in the saints: “The Lord is on my side; I will\nnot fear what man can do unto me. The Lord is the strength of my life; of\nwhom shall I be afraid? Though a host should encamp against me—though I\nwalk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.”(479)\nHow is it that their security remains unshaken, while the world appears to\nbe revolving at random, but because they know that the Lord is universally\noperative, and confide in his operations as beneficial to them? Now, when\ntheir safety is attacked, either by the devil or by wicked men, if they\nwere not supported by the recollection and contemplation of providence,\nthey must necessarily and immediately faint. But when they recollect, that\nthe devil and the whole army of the wicked are in every respect so\nrestrained by the Divine power, that they can neither conceive of any\nhostility against us, nor, after having conceived it, form a plan for its\naccomplishment, nor even move a finger towards the execution of such plan,\nany further than he has permitted, and even commanded them; and that they\nare not only bound by his chains, but also compelled to do him\nservice,—they have an abundant source of consolation. For as it belongs to\nthe Lord to arm their fury, and to direct it to whatever objects he\npleases, so it also belongs to him to fix its limits, that they may not\nenjoy an unbounded triumph according to their own wills. Established in\nthis persuasion, Paul determined his journey in one place by the\npermission of God, which in another he had declared was prevented by\nSatan.(480) If he had only said that Satan was the obstacle, he would have\nappeared to attribute too much power to him, as though he were able to\nsubvert the purposes of God; but when he states God to be the arbiter, on\nwhose permission all journeys depend, he at the same time shows, that\nSatan, with all his machinations, can effect nothing but by his\npermission. For the same reason, David, on account of the various and\nconstant vicissitudes of life, betakes himself to this asylum: “My times\nare in thy hand.”(481) He might have mentioned either the course of life,\nor _time_, in the singular number; but by the word _times_ he intended to\nexpress, that, however unstable the condition of men may be, all the\nvicissitudes which take place are under the government of God. For which\nreason Rezin and the king of Israel, when, after the junction of their\nforces for the destruction of Judah, they resembled firebrands kindled to\nconsume and ruin the land, are called by the Prophet “smoking\nfirebrands,”(482) which can do nothing but emit a little smoke. Thus\nPharaoh, when his riches, his strength, and the multitude of his forces,\nrendered him formidable to all, is himself compared to a sea‐monster, and\nhis forces to fishes.(483) Therefore God denounces that he will take both\nthe captain and his army with his hook, and draw them whither he pleases.\nFinally, to dwell no longer on this part of the subject, you will easily\nperceive, on examination, that ignorance of providence is the greatest of\nmiseries, but that the knowledge of it is attended with the highest\nfelicity.\nXII. On the doctrine of Divine providence, as far as it may conduce to the\nsolid instruction and consolation of the faithful, (for to satisfy a vain\ncuriosity is neither possible nor desirable,) enough would now have been\nsaid, were it not for a difficulty arising from a few passages, which\napparently imply, in opposition to what has been stated, that the counsel\nof God is not firm and stable, but liable to change according to the\nsituation of sublunary affairs. In the first place, there are several\ninstances in which repentance is attributed to God; as, that he repented\nof having created man,(484) and of having exalted Saul to the\nkingdom;(485) and that he will repent of the evil which he had determined\nto inflict on his people, as soon as he shall have perceived their\nconversion.(486) In the next place, we read of the abrogation of some of\nhis decrees. By Jonah he declared to the Ninevites,(487) that, after the\nlapse of forty days, Nineveh should be destroyed; but their penitence\nafterwards obtained from him a more merciful sentence. By the mouth of\nIsaiah he denounced death to Hezekiah;(488) which the prayers and tears of\nthat monarch moved him to defer.(489) Hence many persons argue, that God\nhas not fixed the affairs of men by an eternal decree; but that every\nyear, day, and hour, he decrees one thing or another, according to the\nrespective merits of each individual, or to his own ideas of equity and\njustice. With regard to repentance, we must not admit that it can happen\nto God, any more than ignorance, or error, or impotence. For if no man\nknowingly and willingly lays himself under the necessity of repentance, we\ncannot attribute repentance to God, without saying either that he is\nignorant of the future, or that he cannot avoid it, or that he\nprecipitately and inconsiderately adopts a resolution, of which he\nimmediately repents. But that is so far from the meaning of the Holy\nSpirit, that in the very mention of repentance, he denies that it can\nbelong to God, because “he is not a man, that he should repent.”(490) And\nit must be remarked, that both these points are so connected in the same\nchapter, that a comparison fully reconciles the apparent inconsistency.\nWhere it is said that God repented of having created Saul king, the change\ndeclared to have taken place is figurative. It is almost immediately\nadded, that “The strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not\na man, that he should repent;”(491) in which, without any figure, his\nimmutability is plainly asserted. It is certain, therefore, that the\nordination of God in the administration of human affairs, is perpetual,\nand superior to all repentance. And to place his constancy beyond all\ndoubt, even his adversaries have been constrained to attest it. For\nBalaam, notwithstanding his reluctance, was obliged to break out into the\nfollowing exclamation: “God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the\nson of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?\nor hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?”(492)\nXIII. How, then, it will be inquired, is the term _repentance_ to be\nunderstood, when attributed to God? I reply, in the same manner as all the\nother forms of expression, which describe God to us after the manner of\nmen. For, since our infirmity cannot reach his sublimity, the description\nof him which is given to us, in order that we may understand it, must be\nlowered to the level of our capacity. His method of lowering it, is to\nrepresent himself to us, not as he is in himself, but according to our\nperception of him. Though he is free from all perturbation of mind, he\ndeclares that he is angry with sinners.(493) As, therefore, when we hear\nthat God is angry, we ought not to imagine any commotion in him, but\nrather to consider this expression as borrowed from our perception,\nbecause God carries the appearance of one who is very angry, whenever he\nexecutes judgment,—so neither by the term _repentance_ ought we to\nunderstand any thing but a change of actions; because men are accustomed\nto express their dissatisfaction with themselves by changing their\nactions. Since every change among men, therefore, is a correction of that\nwhich displeases them, and correction proceeds from repentance, therefore\nthe term _repentance_ is used to signify that God makes a change in his\nworks. Yet, at the same time, there is no alteration in his counsel or his\nwill, nor any change in his affections; but how sudden soever the\nvariation may appear to the eyes of men, he perpetually and regularly\nprosecutes what he has foreseen, approved, and decreed from eternity.\nXIV. Nor does the Sacred History, when it records the remission of the\ndestruction which had just been denounced against the Ninevites, and the\nprolongation of the life of Hezekiah after he had been threatened with\ndeath, prove that there was any abrogation of the Divine decrees. Persons\nwho thus understand it, are deceived in their ideas of the threatenings;\nwhich, though expressed in the form of simple declarations, yet, as the\nevent shows, contain in them a tacit condition. For why did God send Jonah\nto the Ninevites, to predict the ruin of their city? Why did he, by the\nmouth of Isaiah, warn Hezekiah of death? He could have destroyed both them\nand him, without previously announcing their end. He had some other object\nin view, therefore, than to forewarn them of their death, and to give them\na distant prospect of its approach. And that was not to destroy them, but\nto reform them, that they might not be destroyed. Therefore the prediction\nof Jonah, that after forty days Nineveh should fall, was uttered to\nprevent its fall. Hezekiah was deprived of the hope of a longer life, in\norder that he might obtain a prolongation of it in answer to his prayers.\nNow, who does not see, that the Lord, by such denunciations as these,\nintended to arouse to repentance the persons whom he thus alarmed, that\nthey might escape the judgment which their sins had deserved? If this be\nadmitted, the nature of the circumstances leads to the conclusion, that we\nmust understand a tacit condition implied in the simple denunciation. This\nis also confirmed by similar examples. The Lord, reprehending king\nAbimelech for having deprived Abraham of his wife, uses these\nwords:—“Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast\ntaken; for she is a man’s wife.” But after Abimelech has excused himself,\nthe Lord speaks in this manner: “Restore the man his wife; for he is a\nprophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou\nrestore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that\nare thine.”(494) You see how, by the first declaration, God terrifies his\nmind, to dispose him to make satisfaction; but in the next, he makes an\nexplicit declaration of his will. Since other passages are to be explained\nin a similar manner, you must not infer that there is any abrogation of a\nprior purpose of the Lord, because he may have annulled some former\ndeclarations. For God rather prepares the way for his eternal ordination,\nwhen, by a denunciation of punishment, he calls to repentance those whom\nhe designs to spare, than makes any variation in his will, or even in his\ndeclarations, except that he does not syllabically express what,\nnevertheless, is easily understood. For that assertion of Isaiah must\nremain true: “The Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?\nand his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?”(495)"

          "title": "Chapter XVIII. God Uses The Agency Of The Impious, And Inclines Their",
          "content": "Minds To Execute His Judgments, Yet Without The Least Stain Of His Perfect\nPurity.\nA question of greater difficulty arises from other passages, where God is\nsaid to incline or draw, according to his own pleasure, Satan himself and\nall the reprobate. For the carnal understanding scarcely comprehends how\nhe, acting by their means, contracts no defilement from their criminality,\nand, even in operations common to himself and them, is free from every\nfault, and yet righteously condemns those whose ministry he uses. Hence\nwas invented the distinction between _doing_ and _permitting_; because to\nmany persons this has appeared an inexplicable difficulty, that Satan and\nall the impious are subject to the power and government of God, so that he\ndirects their malice to whatever end he pleases, and uses their crimes for\nthe execution of his judgments. The modesty of those who are alarmed at\nthe appearance of absurdity, might perhaps be excusable, if they did not\nattempt to vindicate the Divine justice from all accusation by a pretence\nutterly destitute of any foundation in truth. They consider it absurd that\na man should be blinded by the will and command of God, and afterwards be\npunished for his blindness. They therefore evade the difficulty, by\nalleging that it happens only by the permission, and not by the will of\nGod; but God himself, by the most unequivocal declarations, rejects this\nsubterfuge. That men, however, can effect nothing but by the secret will\nof God, and can deliberate on nothing but what he has previously decreed,\nand determines by his secret direction, is proved by express and\ninnumerable testimonies. What we have before cited from the Psalmist, that\n“God hath done whatsoever he hath pleased,”(496) undoubtedly pertains to\nall the actions of men. If God be the certain arbiter of war and peace, as\nis there affirmed, and that without any exception, who will venture to\nassert, that he remains ignorant and unconcerned respecting men, while\nthey are actuated by the blind influence of chance? But this subject will\nbe better elucidated by particular examples. From the first chapter of Job\nwe know that Satan presents himself before God to receive his commands, as\nwell as the angels, who yield a spontaneous obedience. It is, indeed, in a\ndifferent manner, and for a different end; yet he cannot attempt any thing\nbut by the Divine will. Although he seems to obtain only a bare permission\nto afflict that holy man, yet, since this sentence is true, “The Lord\ngave, and the Lord hath taken away,”(497) we conclude that God was the\nauthor of that trial, of which Satan and mischievous robbers and assassins\nwere the immediate agents. Satan endeavours to drive him by desperation\ninto madness. The Sabeans, in a predatory incursion, cruelly and wickedly\nseize upon property not their own. Job acknowledges that he was stripped\nof all his wealth, and reduced to poverty, because such was the will of\nGod. Therefore, whatever is attempted by men, or by Satan himself, God\nstill holds the helm, to direct all their attempts to the execution of his\njudgments. God intends the deception of that perfidious king Ahab; the\ndevil offers his service for that purpose; he is sent with a positive\ncommission to be a lying spirit in the mouth of all the prophets.(498) If\nthe blinding and infatuation of Ahab be a Divine judgment, the pretence of\nbare permission disappears. For it would be ridiculous for a judge merely\nto permit, without decreeing what should be done, and commanding his\nofficers to execute it. The Jews designed to destroy Christ; Pilate and\nhis soldiers complied with their outrageous violence; yet the disciples,\nin a solemn prayer, confess that all the impious did nothing but what “the\nhand and the counsel of God determined before to be done;”(499) agreeably\nto what Peter had already preached, that he was “delivered by the\ndeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God,” that he might be “crucified\nand slain.”(500) As though he had said that God, who saw every thing from\nthe beginning, with a clear knowledge and determined will, appointed what\nthe Jews executed; as he mentions in another place: “Those things which\nGod before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should\nsuffer, he hath so fulfilled.”(501) Absalom, defiling his father’s bed\nwith incest, perpetrated a detestable crime; yet God pronounces that this\nwas his work; for his words are, “Thou didst it secretly; but I will do\nthis thing before all Israel, and before the sun.”(502) Whatever cruelty\nthe Chaldeans exercised in Judea, Jeremiah pronounces to be the work of\nGod;(503) for which reason Nebuchadnezzar is called the servant of God.\nGod frequently proclaims, that the impious are excited to war by his\nhissing, by the sound of his trumpet, by his influence, and by his\ncommand: he calls the Assyrian the rod of his anger, and the staff which\nhe moves with his hand. The destruction of the holy city and the ruin of\nthe temple he calls his own work.(504) David, not murmuring against God,\nbut acknowledging him to be a righteous Judge, confesses the maledictions\nof Shimei to proceed from his command. “The Lord,” says he, “hath said\nunto him, Curse.”(505) It often occurs in the Sacred History, that\nwhatever comes to pass proceeds from the Lord; as the defection of the ten\ntribes,(506) the death of the sons of Eli,(507) and many events of a\nsimilar kind. Those who are but moderately acquainted with the Scriptures\nwill perceive that, for the sake of brevity, out of a great number of\ntestimonies, I have produced only a few; which, nevertheless, abundantly\nevince how nugatory and insipid it is, instead of the providence of God,\nto substitute a bare permission; as though God were sitting in a\nwatchtower, expecting fortuitous events, and so his decisions were\ndependent on the will of men.\nII. With respect to his secret influences, the declaration of Solomon\nconcerning the heart of a king, that it is inclined hither or thither\naccording to the Divine will,(508) certainly extends to the whole human\nrace, and is as much as though he had said, that whatever conceptions we\nform in our minds, they are directed by the secret inspiration of God. And\ncertainly, if he did not operate internally on the human mind, there would\nbe no propriety in asserting, that he causes “the wisdom of the wise to\nperish, and the understanding of the prudent to be hid; that he poureth\ncontempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where\nthere is no way.”(509) And to this alludes, what we frequently read, that\nmen are timorous, as their hearts are possessed with his fear.(510) Thus\nDavid departed from the camp of Saul, without the knowledge of any one;\n“because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them all.”(511) But\nnothing can be desired more explicit than his frequent declarations, that\nhe blinds the minds of men, strikes them with giddiness, inebriates them\nwith the spirit of slumber, fills them with infatuation, and hardens their\nhearts.(512) These passages also many persons refer to permission, as\nthough, in abandoning the reprobate, God permitted them to be blinded by\nSatan. But that solution is too frivolous, since the Holy Spirit expressly\ndeclares that their blindness and infatuation are inflicted by the\nrighteous judgment of God. He is said to have caused the obduracy of\nPharaoh’s heart, and also to have aggravated and confirmed it. Some elude\nthe force of these expressions with a foolish cavil—that, since Pharaoh\nhimself is elsewhere said to have hardened his own heart, his own will is\nstated as the cause of his obduracy; as though these two things were at\nall incompatible with each other, that man should be actuated by God, and\nyet at the same time be active himself. But I retort on them their own\nobjection; for if _hardening_ denotes a bare permission, Pharaoh cannot\nproperly be charged with being the cause of his own obstinacy. Now, how\nweak and insipid would be such an interpretation, as though Pharaoh only\npermitted himself to be hardened! Besides, the Scripture cuts off all\noccasion for such cavils. God says, “I will harden his heart.”(513) So,\nalso, Moses says, concerning the inhabitants of Canaan, that they marched\nforth to battle, because the Lord had hardened their hearts;(514) which is\nlikewise repeated by another Prophet—“He turned their hearts to hate his\npeople.”(515) Thus, also, in Isaiah, he declares he will “send the\nAssyrian against a hypocritical nation, and will give him a charge to take\nthe spoil, and to take the prey;”(516) not that he meant to teach impious\nand refractory men a voluntary obedience, but because he would incline\nthem to execute his judgments, just as if they had his commands engraven\non their minds. Hence it appears that they were impelled by the positive\nappointment of God. I grant, indeed, that God often actuates the reprobate\nby the interposition of Satan; but in such a manner that Satan himself\nacts his part by the Divine impulse, and proceeds to the extent of the\nDivine appointment. Saul was disturbed by an evil spirit; but it is said\nto be “from the Lord;”(517) to teach us that Saul’s madness proceeded from\nthe righteous vengeance of God. Satan is also said to blind “the minds of\nthem which believe not;”(518) but the strength of the delusion proceeds\nfrom God himself, “that they should believe a lie, who believe not the\ntruth.”(519) According to one view of the subject, it is said, “If the\nprophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived\nthat prophet.”(520) But, according to another, God is said himself to\n“give men over to a reprobate mind,”(521) and to the vilest lusts; because\nhe is the principal author of his own righteous vengeance, and Satan is\nonly the dispenser of it. But as we must discuss this subject again in the\nsecond book, where we shall treat of the freedom or slavery of the human\nwill, I think I have now said, in a brief manner, as much as the occasion\nrequired. The whole may be summed up thus; that, as the will of God is\nsaid to be the cause of all things, his providence is established as the\ngovernor in all the counsels and works of men, so that it not only exerts\nits power in the elect, who are influenced by the Holy Spirit, but also\ncompels the compliance of the reprobate.\nIII. But, as I have hitherto only recited such things as are delivered\nwithout any obscurity or ambiguity in the Scriptures, let persons who\nhesitate not to brand with ignominy those oracles of heaven, beware what\nkind of opposition they make. For, if they pretend ignorance, with a\ndesire to be commended for their modesty, what greater instance of pride\ncan be conceived, than to oppose one little word to the authority of God!\nas, “It appears otherwise to me,” or, “I would rather not meddle with this\nsubject.” But if they openly censure, what will they gain by their puny\nattempts against heaven? Their petulance, indeed, is no novelty; for in\nall ages there have been impious and profane men, who have virulently\nopposed this doctrine. But they shall feel the truth of what the Spirit\nlong ago declared by the mouth of David, that God “is clear when he\njudgeth.”(522) David obliquely hints at the madness of men who display\nsuch excessive presumption amidst their insignificance, as not only to\ndispute against God, but to arrogate to themselves the power of condemning\nhim. In the mean time, he briefly suggests, that God is unaffected by all\nthe blasphemies which they discharge against heaven, but that he\ndissipates the mists of calumny, and illustriously displays his\nrighteousness; our faith, also, being founded on the Divine word,(523) and\ntherefore, superior to all the world, from its exaltation looks down with\ncontempt upon those mists. For their first objection, that, if nothing\nhappens but by the will of God, he has in him two contrary wills, because\nhe decrees in his secret counsel what he has publicly prohibited in his\nlaw, is easily refuted. But before I reply, I wish the reader again to be\napprized, that this cavil is directed, not against me, but against the\nHoly Spirit, who dictated to the pious Job this confession, that what had\nbefallen him had happened according to the Divine will: when he had been\nplundered by banditti, he acknowledged in their injuries the righteous\nscourge of God.(524) What says the Scripture in another case? “They,” the\nsons of Eli, “hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the\nLord would slay them.”(525) The Psalmist also exclaims, that “God,” who\n“is in the heavens, hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.”(526) And now I\nhave sufficiently proved, that God is called the author of all those\nthings, which, according to the system of these censors, happen only by\nhis uninfluential permission. He declares that he creates light and\ndarkness, that he forms good and evil,(527) and that no evil occurs, which\nhe has not performed. Let them say, then, whether he exercises his\njudgments voluntarily or involuntarily. But as Moses suggests, that he who\nis killed by the fortuitous fall of an axe, is delivered by God to the\nstroke,(528) so in the Acts, the whole church asserts that Herod and\nPilate conspired to do what the hand and the counsel of God had\npredetermined.(529) And indeed, unless the crucifixion of Christ was\naccording to the will of God, what becomes of our redemption? Yet the will\nof God is neither repugnant to itself, nor subject to change, nor\nchargeable with pretending to dislike what it approves; but whilst in him\nit is uniform and simple, it wears to us the appearance of variety;\nbecause the weakness of our understanding comprehends not how the same\nthing may be in different respects both agreeable to his will, and\ncontrary to it. Paul, after having said that the vocation of the Gentiles\nwas a hidden mystery, adds, that it contained a manifestation of the\nmanifold wisdom of God.(530) Now, because, through the dulness of our\ncapacity, the Divine wisdom appears to us manifold, (or multiform, as it\nhas been translated by an ancient interpreter,) shall we therefore dream\nof any vanity in God himself, as though his counsels were mutable, or his\nthoughts contradictory to each other? Rather, while we comprehend not how\nGod intends that to be done, the doing of which he forbids, let us\nremember our imbecility, and at the same time consider, that the light\nwhich he inhabits, is justly called inaccessible,(531) because it is\noverspread with impenetrable darkness. Therefore all pious and modest men\nwill easily acquiesce in this opinion of Augustine: “That a man may\nsometimes choose, with a good intention, that which is not agreeable to\nthe will of God; as, if a good son wishes his father to live, whilst God\ndetermines that he shall die. It is also possible for a man to will with a\nbad design, what God wills with a good one; as, if a bad son wishes his\nfather to die, which is also the will of God. Now, the former wishes what\nis not agreeable, the latter what is agreeable to the Divine will. And yet\nthe filial affection of the former is more consonant to the righteous will\nof God, than the want of natural affection in the latter, though it\naccords with his secret design. So great is the difference between what\nbelongs to the human will, and what to the Divine, and between the ends to\nwhich the will of every one is to be referred, for approbation or censure.\nFor God fulfils his righteous will by the wicked wills of wicked men.”\nThis writer had just before said, that the apostate angels, and all the\nreprobate, in their defection, acted, as far as respected themselves, in\ndirect opposition to the Divine will; but that this was not possible with\nrespect to the Divine omnipotence; because, while they are opposing the\nwill of God, his will is accomplished concerning them. Whence he exclaims,\n“The works of the Lord are great, prepared according to all his\ndeterminations;”(532) so that, in a wonderful and ineffable manner, that\nis not done without his will which yet is contrary to his will; because it\nwould not be done if he did not permit it; and this permission is not\ninvoluntary, but voluntary; nor would his goodness permit the perpetration\nof any evil, unless his omnipotence were able even from that evil to educe\ngood.\nIV. In the same manner we answer, or rather annihilate, another\nobjection—that, if God not only uses the agency of the impious, but\ngoverns their designs and affections, he is the author of all crimes; and\ntherefore men are undeservedly condemned, if they execute what God has\ndecreed, because they obey his will. For his will is improperly confounded\nwith his precept, between which innumerable examples evince the difference\nto be very great. For although, when Absalom defiled the wives of his\nfather, it was the will of God by this disgrace to punish the adultery of\nDavid,(533) he did not therefore command that abandoned son to commit\nincest, unless perhaps with respect to David, as he speaks of the\nreproaches of Shimei.(534) For when he confesses Shimei’s maledictions to\nproceed from the Divine command, he by no means commends his obedience, as\nthough that impudent and worthless man were fulfilling a Divine precept;\nbut acknowledging his tongue as the scourge of God, he patiently submits\nto the chastisement. Let it be remembered, that whilst God by means of the\nimpious fulfils his secret decrees, they are not excusable, as though they\nwere obedient to his precepts, which they wantonly and intentionally\nviolate. The direction of the perverse actions of men, by the secret\nprovidence of God, is illustriously exemplified in the election of\nJeroboam to the regal dignity.(535) The temerity and infatuation of the\npeople in this proceeding are severely condemned,(536) because they\nperverted the order established by God, and perfidiously revolted from the\nfamily of David; and yet we know that this event was agreeable to the\nDivine will. Whence there is an appearance of contradiction also in the\nlanguage of Hosea; for in one place God complains that the erection of\nthat kingdom was without his knowledge and against his will; but in\nanother declares that he gave Jeroboam to be a king in his anger.(537) How\ncan these things be reconciled, that Jeroboam did not reign by the will of\nGod, and yet that God appointed him to be king? Why, thus: because neither\ncould the people revolt from the family of David, without shaking off the\nyoke which God had imposed upon them; nor yet was God deprived of the\nliberty of thus punishing the ingratitude of Solomon. We see, then, how\nGod, while he hates perfidy, yet righteously and with a different design\ndecrees the defection; whence also Jeroboam is, beyond all expectation,\nconstrained by the holy unction to assume the regal office. In the same\nmanner, the Sacred History relates, that God raised up an enemy, to\ndeprive the son of Solomon of part of the kingdom.(538) Let the reader\ndiligently consider both these things: because it had pleased God that the\npeople should be under the government of one king, their division into two\nparts was contrary to his will; and yet from his will the schism first\noriginated. For certainly since a Prophet, both by a prediction and by the\nceremony of unction, excited a hope of succeeding to the kingdom, in the\nmind of Jeroboam, who before entertained not a thought of such an event,\nthis could not be done, either without the knowledge, or against the will,\nof God, who commanded it to be done; and yet the rebellion of the people\nis justly condemned, because, in opposition to the Divine will, they\nrevolted from the posterity of David. Thus, also, it is afterwards\nsubjoined, that “the cause” of the haughty contempt of the people\nmanifested by Rehoboam “was of God, that the Lord might perform his word,\nwhich he spake by the hand of Ahijah” his servant.(539) See how the sacred\nunion is divided, in opposition to the will of God, and yet by his will\nthe ten tribes are alienated from the son of Solomon. Let us add another\nsimilar example, where, with the consent, and even by the assistance of\nthe people, the sons of Ahab are massacred, and all his posterity\nexterminated.(540) Jehu, indeed, truly observed that “there had fallen\nunto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord,” but that he had “done\nthat which he spake by his servant Elijah.” And yet he justly reprehends\nthe citizens of Samaria for having lent their assistance. “Are ye\nrighteous?” says he; “behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him;\nbut who slew all these?” If I am not deceived, I have now clearly\nexplained how the same act displays the criminality of men and the justice\nof God. And to modest minds this answer of Augustine will always be\nsufficient: “Since God delivered Christ, and Christ delivered his own\nbody, and Judas delivered the Lord, why, in this delivery, is God\nrighteous and man guilty? Because in the same act, they acted not from the\nsame cause.” But if any persons find greater difficulty in what we now\nassert, that there is no consent between God and man, in cases where man\nby his righteous influence commits unlawful actions, let them remember\nwhat is advanced by Augustine in another place: “Who can but tremble at\nthose judgments, when God does even in the hearts of the wicked whatsoever\nhe pleases, and yet renders to them according to their demerits?” And\ncertainly it would no more be right to attribute to God the blame of the\nperfidy of Judas, because he decreed the delivery of his Son, and actually\ndelivered him to death, than to transfer to Judas the praise of\nredemption. Therefore the same writer elsewhere informs us, that in this\nscrutiny God inquires, not what men could have done, nor what they have\ndone, but what they intended to do, that he may take cognizance of their\ndesign and their will. Let those to whom there appears any harshness in\nthis procedure, consider a little how far their obstinacy is tolerable,\nwhile they reject a truth which is attested by plain testimonies of\nScripture, because it exceeds their comprehension, and condemn the\npublication of those things which God, unless he had known that the\nknowledge of them would be useful, would never have commanded to be taught\nby his Prophets and Apostles. For our wisdom ought to consist in embracing\nwith gentle docility, and without any exception, all that is delivered in\nthe sacred Scriptures. But those who oppose this doctrine with less\nmodesty and greater violence, since it is evident that their opposition is\nagainst God, are unworthy of a longer refutation."

          "content": "On All Mankind, And Of Their Degeneracy From Their Primitive Condition.\nThe Doctrine Of Original Sin.\nThere is much reason in the old adage, which so strongly recommends to man\nthe knowledge of himself. For if it be thought disgraceful to be ignorant\nof whatever relates to the conduct of human life, ignorance of ourselves\nis much more shameful, which causes us, in deliberating on subjects of\nimportance, to grope our way in miserable obscurity, or even in total\ndarkness. But in proportion to the utility of this precept ought to be our\ncaution not to make a preposterous use of it; as we see some philosophers\nhave done. For while they exhort man to the knowledge of himself, the end\nthey propose is, that he may not remain ignorant of his own dignity and\nexcellence: nor do they wish him to contemplate in himself any thing but\nwhat may swell him with vain confidence, and inflate him with pride. But\nthe knowledge of ourselves consists, first, in considering what was\nbestowed on us at our creation, and the favours we continually receive\nfrom the Divine benignity, that we may know how great the excellence of\nour nature would have been, if it had retained its integrity; yet, at the\nsame time, recollecting that we have nothing properly our own, may feel\nour precarious tenure of all that God has conferred on us, so as always to\nplace our dependence upon him. Secondly, we should contemplate our\nmiserable condition since the fall of Adam, the sense of which tends to\ndestroy all boasting and confidence, to overwhelm us with shame, and to\nfill us with real humility. For as God, at the beginning, formed us after\nhis own image, that he might elevate our minds both to the practice of\nvirtue, and to the contemplation of eternal life, so, to prevent the great\nexcellence of our species, which distinguishes us from the brutes, from\nbeing buried in sottish indolence, it is worthy of observation, that the\ndesign of our being endued with reason and intelligence is, that, leading\na holy and virtuous life, we may aspire to the mark set before us of a\nblessed immortality. But we cannot think upon that primeval dignity,\nwithout having our attention immediately called to the melancholy\nspectacle of our disgrace and ignominy, since in the person of the first\nman we are fallen from our original condition. Hence arise disapprobation\nand abhorrence of ourselves, and real humility; and we are inflamed with\nfresh ardour to seek after God, to recover in him those excellences of\nwhich we find ourselves utterly destitute.\nII. This is what the truth of God directs us to seek in the examination of\nourselves: it requires a knowledge that will abstract us from all\nconfidence in our own ability, deprive us of every cause of boasting, and\nreduce us to submission. We must observe this rule, if we wish to reach\nthe proper point of knowledge and action. I am aware of the superior\nplausibility of that opinion, which invites us rather to a consideration\nof our goodness, than to a view of our miserable poverty and ignominy,\nwhich ought to overwhelm us with shame. For there is nothing more desired\nby the human mind than soothing flatteries; and therefore, it listens with\nextreme credulity, to hear its excellences magnified. Wherefore it is the\nless wonderful that the majority of mankind have fallen into such a\npernicious error. For, an immoderate self‐love being innate in all men,\nthey readily persuade themselves that there is nothing in them which\njustly deserves to be an object of aversion. Thus, without any extraneous\nsupport, this very false opinion, that man has in himself sufficient\nability to insure his own virtue and happiness, generally prevails. But if\nsome prefer more modest sentiments, though they concede something to God,\nin order to avoid the appearance of arrogating every thing to themselves,\nyet they make such a distribution, that the principal cause of boasting\nand confidence always remains with them. If they hear any discourse that\nflatters the pride already operating spontaneously in their hearts,\nnothing can gratify them more. Therefore every one who in his preaching\nhas kindly extolled the excellence of human nature, has received great\napplause from almost all ages. But such a commendation of human excellence\nas teaches man to be satisfied with himself, only enamours him of his own\namiableness, and thus produces an illusion which involves those who assent\nto it in most dreadful perdition. For to what purpose is it for us,\nrelying on every vain confidence, to deliberate, to determine, and to\nattempt things which we think tend to our advantage, and in our first\nefforts, to find ourselves destitute of sound understanding and true\nvirtue, yet securely to proceed, till we fall into destruction? But this\nmust be the fate of all who confide in the efficacy of their own virtue.\nWhosoever, therefore, attends to such teachers as amuse us with a mere\nexhibition of our virtues, will make no progress in the knowledge of\nhimself, but will be absorbed in the most pernicious ignorance.\nIII. Therefore, whilst the truth of God agrees in this point with the\ncommon consent of all mankind, that the second branch of wisdom consists\nin the knowledge of ourselves, yet with respect to the knowledge itself\nthere is no small disagreement. For, according to carnal apprehension, a\nman is thought to be well acquainted with himself, when, confiding in his\nown understanding and integrity, he assumes a presumptuous boldness,\nincites himself to the duties of virtue, and, declaring war against vice,\nuses his most strenuous endeavours to adhere to what is fair and\nhonourable. But he, who inspects and examines himself by the rule of the\nDivine judgment, finds nothing that can raise his mind to a genuine\nconfidence; and the more fully he has examined himself, the greater is his\ndejection; till, entirely discarding all confidence, he leaves himself no\nability for the proper conduct of his life. Yet it is not the will of God\nthat we should forget the primitive dignity conferred by him on our father\nAdam, which ought justly to awaken us to the pursuit of righteousness and\ngoodness. For we cannot reflect on our original condition, and on the end\nof our creation, without being excited to meditate on immortality, and to\naspire after the kingdom of God. But this reflection is so far from\nelating us with pride, that it rather produces humility. For what is that\noriginal condition? That from which we are fallen. What is that end of our\ncreation? That from which we are wholly departed; so that we should lament\nthe miseries of our present state, and in the midst of our lamentation,\naspire after the dignity which we have lost. Now, when we say that man\nshould behold in himself nothing that might elate him with pride, we mean\nthat there is nothing in him in the confidence of which he ought to be\nproud. Wherefore we may divide the knowledge man ought to have of himself\ninto these two parts. First, he should consider the end of his being\ncreated and endued with such estimable gifts; a reflection which may\nexcite him to the consideration of Divine worship, and of a future life.\nSecondly, he should examine his own ability, or rather his want of\nability, the view of which may confound and almost annihilate him. The\nformer consideration is adapted to acquaint him with his duty, the latter\nwith his power to perform it. We shall treat of them both in regular\norder.\nIV. But, since it could not have been a trivial offence, but must have\nbeen a detestable crime, that was so severely punished by God, we must\nconsider the nature of Adam’s sin, which kindled the dreadful flame of\nDivine wrath against the whole human race. The vulgar opinion concerning\nthe intemperance of gluttony is quite puerile; as though the sum and\nsubstance of all virtues consisted in an abstinence from one particular\nkind of fruit, when there were diffused on every side all the delights\nwhich could possibly be desired, and the happy fecundity of the earth\nafforded an abundance and variety of dainties. We must therefore look\nfurther, because the prohibition of the tree of knowledge of good and evil\nwas a test of obedience, that Adam might prove his willing submission to\nthe Divine government. And the name itself shows that the precept was\ngiven for no other purpose than that he might be contented with his\ncondition, and not aim with criminal cupidity at any higher. But the\npromise which authorized him to expect eternal life, as long as he should\neat of the tree of life, and, on the other hand, the dreadful denunciation\nof death, as soon as he should taste of the tree of knowledge of good and\nevil, were calculated for the probation and exercise of his faith. Hence\nit is easy to infer by what means Adam provoked the wrath of God against\nhim. Augustine, indeed, properly observes, that pride was the first of all\nevils; because, if ambition had not elated man beyond what was lawful and\nright, he might have continued in his honourable situation. But we may\nobtain a more complete definition from the nature of the temptation as\ndescribed by Moses. For as the woman, by the subtlety of the serpent, was\nseduced to discredit the word of God, it is evident that the fall\ncommenced in disobedience. This is also confirmed by Paul, who states that\nall men were ruined by the disobedience of one.(541) But it is also to be\nobserved, that when the first man rebelled against the government of God,\nhe not only was ensnared by the allurements of Satan, but despised the\ntruth, and turned aside to falsehood. And there certainly can be no\nreverence of God left, where his word is contemned; for we preserve a\nsense of his majesty and the purity of his worship, no longer than we\nimplicitly attend to his voice. Infidelity, therefore, was the root of\nthat defection. But hence sprang ambition, pride, and ingratitude, since\nAdam, by coveting more than was granted, offered an indignity to the\nDivine goodness, which had so greatly enriched him. Now, it was monstrous\nimpiety, that a son of the earth should not be satisfied with being made\nafter the similitude of God, unless he could also be equal to him. If\napostasy, which consists in revolting from the government of the Creator,\nand petulantly rejecting his authority, be a base and execrable crime, it\nis a vain attempt to extenuate the sin of Adam. Though the transgression\nof our first parents was not simple apostasy; they were also guilty of\nvile reproaches against God, in consenting to the calumnies of Satan, who\naccused God of falsehood, envy, and malignity. Finally, infidelity opened\nthe gate to ambition, and ambition produced obstinacy, so that they cast\noff the fear of God, and precipitated themselves whithersoever they were\nled by their lawless desires. With propriety, therefore, Bernard teaches\nthat the gate of salvation is opened to us, when in the present day we\nreceive the Gospel with our ears, as death was once admitted at the same\ndoors when they lay open to Satan. For Adam had never dared to resist the\nauthority of God, if he had not discredited his word. This was certainly\nthe best check for a due regulation of all the affections, that the chief\ngood consists in the practice of righteousness, in obedience to the\ncommands of God; and that the ultimate end of a happy life is to be\nbeloved by him. Being seduced, therefore, by the blasphemies of the devil,\nhe did all that was in his power towards a total annihilation of the glory\nof God.\nV. As the spiritual life of Adam consisted in a union to his Maker, so an\nalienation from him was the death of his soul. Nor is it surprising that\nhe ruined his posterity by his defection, which has perverted the whole\norder of nature in heaven and earth. “The creatures groan,” says Paul,\n“being made subject to vanity, not willingly.”(542) If the cause be\ninquired, it is undoubtedly that they sustain part of the punishment due\nto the demerits of man, for whose use they were created. And his guilt\nbeing the origin of that curse which extends to every part of the world,\nit is reasonable to conclude its propagation to all his offspring.\nTherefore, when the Divine image in him was obliterated, and he was\npunished with the loss of wisdom, strength, sanctity, truth, and\nrighteousness, with which he had been adorned, but which were succeeded by\nthe dreadful pests of ignorance, impotence, impurity, vanity, and\niniquity, he suffered not alone, but involved all his posterity with him,\nand plunged them into the same miseries. This is that hereditary\ncorruption which the fathers called _original sin_; meaning by sin, the\ndepravation of a nature previously good and pure; on which subject they\nhad much contention, nothing being more remote from natural reason, than\nthat all should be criminated on account of the guilt of one, and thus his\nsin become common; which seems to have been the reason why the most\nancient doctors of the Church did but obscurely glance at this point, or\nat least explained it with less perspicuity than it required. Yet this\ntimidity could not prevent Pelagius from arising, who profanely pretended,\nthat the sin of Adam only ruined himself, and did not injure his\ndescendants. By concealing the disease with this delusion, Satan attempted\nto render it incurable. But when it was evinced by the plain testimony of\nthe Scripture, that sin was communicated from the first man to all his\nposterity, he sophistically urged that it was communicated by imitation,\nnot by propagation. Therefore good men, and beyond all others Augustine,\nhave laboured to demonstrate that we are not corrupted by any adventitious\nmeans, but that we derive an innate depravity from our very birth. The\ndenial of this was an instance of consummate impudence. But the temerity\nof the Pelagians and Celestians will not appear surprising to him who\nperceives from the writings of Augustine, what a want of modesty they\ndiscover in every thing else. There is certainly no ambiguity in the\nconfession of David, that he was shapen in iniquity, and in sin his mother\nconceived him.(543) He is not there exposing the sins of his mother or of\nhis father; but to enhance his commendations of the Divine goodness\ntowards him, he commences the confession of his depravity from the time of\nhis conception. As it is evident that this was not peculiar to David, it\nis fairly concluded, that his case exemplifies the common condition of\nmankind. Every descendant, therefore, from the impure source, is born\ninfected with the contagion of sin; and even before we behold the light of\nlife, we are in the sight of God defiled and polluted. For “who can bring\na clean thing out of an unclean?” The book of Job tells us, “Not\none.”(544)\nVI. We have heard that the impurity of the parents is so transmitted to\nthe children, that all, without a single exception, are polluted as soon\nas they exist. But we shall not find the origin of this pollution, unless\nwe ascend to the first parent of us all, as to the fountain which sends\nforth all the streams. Thus it is certain that Adam was not only the\nprogenitor, but as it were the root of mankind, and therefore that all the\nrace were necessarily vitiated in his corruption. The Apostle explains\nthis by a comparison between him and Christ: “As,” says he, “by one man\nsin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all\nmen, for that all have sinned,”(545) so, by the grace of Christ,\nrighteousness and life have been restored to us. What cavil will the\nPelagians raise here? That the sin of Adam was propagated by imitation? Do\nwe then receive no other advantage from the righteousness of Christ than\nthe proposal of an example for our imitation? Who can bear such blasphemy?\nBut if it cannot be controverted that the righteousness of Christ is ours\nby communication, and life as its consequence, it is equally evident that\nboth were lost in Adam, in the same manner in which they were recovered in\nChrist, and that sin and death were introduced by Adam, in the same manner\nin which they are abolished by Christ. There is no obscurity in the\ndeclaration that many are made righteous by the obedience of Christ,(546)\nas they had been made sinners by the disobedience of Adam. And, therefore,\nbetween these two persons there is this relation, that the one ruined us\nby involving us in his destruction, the other by his grace has restored us\nto salvation. Any more prolix or tedious proof of a truth supported by\nsuch clear evidence must, I think, be unnecessary. Thus also in the First\nEpistle to the Corinthians, with a view to confirm the pious in a\nconfidence of the resurrection, he shows, that the life which had been\nlost in Adam, was recovered in Christ.(547) He, who pronounces that we\nwere all dead in Adam, does also at the same time plainly declare, that we\nwere implicated in the guilt of his sin. For no condemnation could reach\nthose who were perfectly clear from all charge of iniquity. But his\nmeaning cannot be better understood than from the relation of the other\nmember of the sentence, where he informs us that the hope of life is\nrestored in Christ. But that is well known to be accomplished, only when\nChrist, by a wonderful communication, transfuses into us the virtue of his\nrighteousness; as it is elsewhere said, “The Spirit is life, because of\nrighteousness.”(548) No other explanation therefore can be given of our\nbeing said to be dead in Adam, than that his transgression not only\nprocured misery and ruin for himself, but also precipitated our nature\ninto similar destruction. And that not by his personal guilt as an\nindividual, which pertains not to us, but because he infected all his\ndescendants with the corruption into which he had fallen. Otherwise there\nwould be no truth in the assertion of Paul, that all are by nature\nchildren of wrath,(549) if they had not been already under the curse even\nbefore their birth. Now, it is easily inferred that our nature is there\ncharacterized, not as it was created by God, but as it was vitiated in\nAdam; because it would be unreasonable to make God the author of death.\nAdam, therefore, corrupted himself in such a manner, that the contagion\nhas been communicated from him to all his offspring. And Christ himself,\nthe heavenly Judge, declares, in the most unequivocal terms, that all are\nborn in a state of pravity and corruption, when he teaches, that\n“whatsoever is born of the flesh is flesh,”(550) and that, therefore, the\ngate of life is closed against all who have not been regenerated.\nVII. Nor, to enable us to understand this subject, have we any need to\nenter on that tedious dispute, with which the fathers were not a little\nperplexed, whether the soul of a son proceeds by derivation or\ntransmission from the soul of the father, because the soul is the\nprincipal seat of the pollution. We ought to be satisfied with this, that\nthe Lord deposited with Adam the endowments he chose to confer on the\nhuman nature; and therefore that when he lost the favours he had received,\nhe lost them not only for himself, but for us all. Who will be solicitous\nabout a transmission of the soul, when he hears that Adam received the\nornaments that he lost, no less for us than for himself? that they were\ngiven, not to one man only, but to the whole human nature? There is\nnothing absurd therefore, if, in consequence of his being spoiled of his\ndignities, that nature be destitute and poor; if, in consequence of his\nbeing polluted with sin, the whole nature be infected with the contagion.\nFrom a putrefied root, therefore, have sprung putrid branches, which have\ntransmitted their putrescence to remoter ramifications. For the children\nwere so vitiated in their parent, that they became contagious to their\ndescendants: there was in Adam such a spring of corruption, that it is\ntransfused from parents to children in a perpetual stream. But the cause\nof the contagion is not in the substance of the body or of the soul; but\nbecause it was ordained by God, that the gifts which he conferred on the\nfirst man should by him be preserved or lost both for himself and for all\nhis posterity. But the cavil of the Pelagians, that it is improbable that\nchildren should derive corruption from pious parents, whereas they ought\nrather to be sanctified by their purity, is easily refuted. For they\ndescend from their carnal generation, not from their spiritual generation.\nTherefore, as Augustine says, “Neither the guilty unbeliever, nor the\njustified believer, generates innocent, but guilty children, because the\ngeneration of both is from corrupted nature.” If they in some measure\nparticipate of the sanctity of their parents, that is the peculiar\nbenediction of the people of God, which supersedes not the first and\nuniversal curse previously denounced on the human nature. For their guilt\nis from nature, but their sanctification from supernatural grace.\nVIII. To remove all uncertainty and misunderstanding on this subject, let\nus define original sin. It is not my intention to discuss all the\ndefinitions given by writers; I shall only produce one, which I think\nperfectly consistent with the truth. Original sin, therefore, appears to\nbe an hereditary pravity and corruption of our nature, diffused through\nall the parts of the soul, rendering us obnoxious to the Divine wrath, and\nproducing in us those works which the Scripture calls “works of the\nflesh.”(551) And this is indeed what Paul frequently denominates _sin_.\nThe works which proceed thence, such as adulteries, fornications, thefts,\nhatreds, murders, revellings, he calls in the same manner “fruits of sin;”\nalthough they are also called “sins” in many passages of Scripture, and\neven by himself. These two things therefore should be distinctly observed:\nfirst, that our nature being so totally vitiated and depraved, we are, on\naccount of this very corruption, considered as convicted and justly\ncondemned in the sight of God, to whom nothing is acceptable but\nrighteousness, innocence, and purity. And this liableness to punishment\narises not from the delinquency of another; for when it is said that the\nsin of Adam renders us obnoxious to the Divine judgment, it is not to be\nunderstood as if we, though innocent, were undeservedly loaded with the\nguilt of his sin; but, because we are all subject to a curse, in\nconsequence of his transgression, he is therefore said to have involved us\nin guilt. Nevertheless we derive from him, not only the punishment, but\nalso the pollution to which the punishment is justly due. Wherefore\nAugustine, though he frequently calls it the sin of another, the more\nclearly to indicate its transmission to us by propagation, yet, at the\nsame time, also asserts it properly to belong to every individual. And the\nApostle himself expressly declares, that “death has therefore passed upon\nall men, for that all have sinned;”(552) that is, have been involved in\noriginal sin, and defiled with its blemishes. And therefore infants\nthemselves, as they bring their condemnation into the world with them, are\nrendered obnoxious to punishment by their own sinfulness, not by the\nsinfulness of another. For though they have not yet produced the fruits of\ntheir iniquity, yet they have the seed of it within them; even their whole\nnature is as it were a seed of sin, and therefore cannot but be odious and\nabominable to God. Whence it follows, that it is properly accounted sin in\nthe sight of God, because there could be no guilt without crime. The other\nthing to be remarked is, that this depravity never ceases in us, but is\nperpetually producing new fruits, those works of the flesh, which we have\nbefore described, like the emission of flame and sparks from a heated\nfurnace, or like the streams of water from a never failing spring.\nWherefore those who have defined original sin as a privation of the\noriginal righteousness, which we ought to possess, though they comprise\nthe whole of the subject, yet have not used language sufficiently\nexpressive of its operation and influence. For our nature is not only\ndestitute of all good, but is so fertile in all evils that it cannot\nremain inactive. Those who have called it _concupiscence_ have used an\nexpression not improper, if it were only added, which is far from being\nconceded by most persons, that every thing in man, the understanding and\nwill, the soul and body, is polluted and engrossed by this concupiscence;\nor, to express it more briefly, that man is of himself nothing else but\nconcupiscence.\nIX. Wherefore I have asserted that sin has possessed all the powers of the\nsoul, since Adam departed from the fountain of righteousness. For man has\nnot only been ensnared by the inferior appetites, but abominable impiety\nhas seized the very citadel of his mind, and pride has penetrated into the\ninmost recesses of his heart; so that it is weak and foolish to restrict\nthe corruption which has proceeded thence, to what are called the sensual\naffections, or to call it an incentive which allures, excites, and\nattracts to sin, only what they style the sensual part. In this the\ngrossest ignorance has been discovered by Peter Lombard, who, when\ninvestigating the seat of it, says that it is in the flesh, according to\nthe testimony of Paul,(553) not indeed exclusively, but because it\nprincipally appears in the flesh; as though Paul designated only a part of\nthe soul, and not the whole of our nature, which is opposed to\nsupernatural grace. Now, Paul removes every doubt by informing us that the\ncorruption resides not in one part only, but that there is nothing pure\nand uncontaminated by its mortal infection. For, when arguing respecting\ncorrupt nature, he not only condemns the inordinate motions of the\nappetites, but principally insists on the blindness of the mind, and the\ndepravity of the heart;(554) and the third chapter of his Epistle to the\nRomans is nothing but a description of original sin. This appears more\nevident from our renovation. For “the Spirit,” which is opposed to “the\nold man” and “the flesh,” not only denotes the grace, which corrects the\ninferior or sensual part of the soul, but comprehends a complete\nreformation of all its powers. And therefore Paul not only enjoins us to\nmortify our sensual appetites, but exhorts us to be renewed in the spirit\nof our mind;(555) and in another place he directs us to be transformed by\nthe renewing of our mind.(556) Whence it follows, that that part, which\nprincipally displays the excellence and dignity of the soul, is not only\nwounded, but so corrupted, that it requires not merely to be healed, but\nto receive a new nature. How far sin occupies both the mind and the heart,\nwe shall presently see. My intention here was only to hint, in a brief\nway, that man is so totally overwhelmed, as with a deluge, that no part is\nfree from sin; and therefore that whatever proceeds from him is accounted\nsin; as Paul says that all the affections or thoughts of the flesh are\nenmity against God, and therefore death.(557)\nX. Now, let us dismiss those who dare to charge God with their\ncorruptions, because we say that men are naturally corrupt. They err in\nseeking for the work of God in their own pollution, whereas they should\nrather seek it in the nature of Adam while yet innocent and uncorrupted.\nOur perdition therefore proceeds from the sinfulness of our flesh, not\nfrom God; it being only a consequence of our degenerating from our\nprimitive condition. And let no one murmur that God might have made a\nbetter provision for our safety, by preventing the fall of Adam. For such\nan objection ought to be abominated, as too presumptuously curious, by all\npious minds; and it also belongs to the mystery of predestination, which\nshall afterwards be treated in its proper place. Wherefore let us\nremember, that our ruin must be imputed to the corruption of our nature,\nthat we may not bring an accusation against God himself, the author of\nnature. That this fatal wound is inherent in our nature, is indeed a\ntruth; but it is an important question, whether it was in it originally,\nor was derived from any extraneous cause. But it is evident that it was\noccasioned by sin. We have therefore no reason to complain, but of\nourselves; which in the Scripture is distinctly remarked. For the Preacher\nsays, “This only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they\nhave sought out many inventions.”(558) It is clear that the misery of man\nmust be ascribed solely to himself, since he was favoured with rectitude\nby the Divine goodness, but has lapsed into vanity through his own folly.\nXI. We say, therefore, that man is corrupted by a natural depravity, but\nwhich did not originate from nature. We deny that it proceeded from\nnature, to signify that it is rather an adventitious quality or accident,\nthan a substantial property originally innate. Yet we call it natural,\nthat no one may suppose it to be contracted by every individual from\ncorrupt habit, whereas it prevails over all by hereditary right. Nor is\nthis representation of ours without authority. For the same reason the\nApostle says, that we are all by nature the children of wrath.(559) How\ncould God, who is pleased with all his meanest works, be angry with the\nnoblest of all his creatures? But he is angry rather with the corruption\nof his work, than with his work itself. Therefore, if, on account of the\ncorruption of human nature, man be justly said to be naturally abominable\nto God, he may also be truly said to be naturally depraved and corrupt; as\nAugustine, in consequence of the corruption of nature, hesitates not to\ncall those sins natural, which necessarily predominate in our flesh, where\nthey are not prevented by the grace of God. Thus vanishes the foolish and\nnugatory system of the Manichæans, who, having imagined in man a\nsubstantial wickedness, presumed to invent for him a new creator, that\nthey might not appear to assign the cause and origin of evil to a\nrighteous God."

          "title": "Chapter II. Man, In His Present State, Despoiled Of Freedom Of Will, And",
          "content": "Subjected To A Miserable Slavery.\nSince we have seen that the domination of sin, from the time of its\nsubjugation of the first man, not only extends over the whole race, but\nalso exclusively possesses every soul, it now remains to be more closely\ninvestigated, whether we are despoiled of all freedom, and, if any\nparticle of it yet remain, how far its power extends. But, that we may the\nmore easily discover the truth of this question, I will first set up by\nthe way a mark, by which our whole course must be regulated. The best\nmethod of guarding against error is to consider the dangers which threaten\nus on every side. For when man is declared to be destitute of all\nrectitude, he immediately makes it an occasion of slothfulness; and\nbecause he is said to have no power of himself for the pursuit of\nrighteousness, he totally neglects it, as though it did not at all concern\nhim. On the other hand, he cannot arrogate any thing to himself, be it\never so little, without God being robbed of his honour, and himself being\nendangered by presumptuous temerity. Therefore, to avoid striking on\neither of these rocks, this will be the course to be pursued—that man,\nbeing taught that he has nothing good left in his possession, and being\nsurrounded on every side with the most miserable necessity, should,\nnevertheless, be instructed to aspire to the good of which he is\ndestitute, and to the liberty of which he is deprived; and should be\nroused from indolence with more earnestness, than if he were supposed to\nbe possessed of the greatest strength. The necessity of the latter is\nobvious to every one. The former, I perceive, is doubted by more than it\nought to be. For this being placed beyond all controversy, that man must\nnot be deprived of any thing that properly belongs to him, it ought also\nto be manifest how important it is that he should be prevented from false\nboasting. For if he was not even then permitted to glory in himself, when\nby the Divine beneficence he was decorated with the noblest ornaments, how\nmuch ought he now to be humbled, when, on account of his ingratitude, he\nhas been hurled from the summit of glory to the abyss of ignominy! At that\ntime, I say, when he was exalted to the most honourable eminence, the\nScripture attributes nothing to him, but that he was created after the\nimage of God; which certainly implies that his happiness consisted not in\nany goodness of his own, but in a participation of God. What, then,\nremains for him now, deprived of all glory, but that he acknowledge God,\nto whose beneficence he could not be thankful, when he abounded in the\nriches of his favour? and that he now, at least, by a confession of his\npoverty, glorify him, whom he glorified not by an acknowledgment of his\nblessings? It is also no less conducive to our interests than to the\nDivine glory, that all the praise of wisdom and strength be taken away\nfrom us; so that they join sacrilege to our fall, who ascribe to us any\nthing more than truly belongs to us. For what else is the consequence,\nwhen we are taught to contend in our own strength, but that we are lifted\ninto the air on a reed, which being soon broken, we fall to the ground.\nThough our strength is placed in too favourable a point of view, when it\nis compared to a reed. For it is nothing but smoke, whatever vain men have\nimagined and pretend concerning it. Wherefore it is not without reason,\nthat that remarkable sentence is so frequently repeated by Augustine, that\nfree will is rather overthrown than established even by its own advocates.\nIt was necessary to premise these things for the sake of some, who, when\nthey hear that human power is completely subverted in order that the power\nof God may be established in man, inveterately hate this whole argument,\nas dangerous and unprofitable; which yet appears to be highly useful to\nus, and essential to true religion.\nII. As we have just before said that the faculties of the soul consist in\nthe mind and the heart, let us now consider the ability of each. The\nphilosophers, indeed, with general consent, pretend, that in the mind\npresides Reason, which like a lamp illuminates with its counsels, and like\na queen governs the will; for that it is so irradiated with Divine light\nas to be able to give the best counsels, and endued with such vigour as to\nbe qualified to govern in the most excellent manner; that Sense, on the\ncontrary, is torpid and afflicted with weakness of sight, so that it\nalways creeps on the ground, and is absorbed in the grossest objects, nor\never elevates itself to a view of the truth; that Appetite, if it can\nsubmit to the obedience of reason, and resist the attractions of sense, is\ninclined to the practice of virtues, travels the path of rectitude, and is\nformed into will; but that, if it be devoted to the servitude of sense, it\nis thereby so corrupted and depraved as to degenerate into lust. And as,\naccording to their opinion, there reside in the soul those faculties which\nI have before mentioned, understanding, sense, and appetite, or\nwill,—which appellation is now more commonly used,—they assert that the\nunderstanding is endued with reason, that most excellent guide to a good\nand a happy life, provided it only maintains itself in its own excellence,\nand exerts its innate power; but that the inferior affection of the soul,\nwhich is called _sense_, and by which it is seduced into error, is of such\na nature that it may be tamed and gradually conquered by the rod of\nreason. They place the will in the middle station between reason and\nsense, as perfectly at liberty, whether it chooses to obey reason, or to\nsubmit to the violence of sense.\nIII. Sometimes, indeed, being convinced by the testimony of experience,\nthey admit how extremely difficult it is for a man to establish within him\nthe kingdom of reason; while he is exposed at one time to the\nsolicitations of alluring pleasures, at another to the delusions of\npretended blessings, and at others to the violent agitations of immoderate\npassions, compared by Plato to so many cords dragging him in various\ndirections. For which reason Cicero says that the sparks kindled by nature\nare soon extinguished by corrupt opinions and evil manners. But when such\nmaladies have once taken possession of the human mind, they acknowledge\ntheir progress to be too violent to be easily restrained; nor do they\nhesitate to compare them to fierce horses, who, having rejected reason,\nlike horses that have thrown off the charioteer, indulge themselves in\nevery extravagance, without the least restraint. But they consider it as\nbeyond all controversy, that virtue and vice are in our own power; for if\nit be at our election, they say, to do this or that, therefore it must\nalso be, to abstain from doing it. And, on the other hand, if we are free\nto abstain from it, we must also be free to do it. But we appear freely\nand voluntarily to do those things which we do, and to abstain from those\nthings from which we abstain; therefore, if we do any good action, when we\nplease we may omit it; if we perpetrate any evil, that also we may avoid.\nMoreover, some of them have advanced to such a degree of presumption, as\nto boast, that we are indebted to the gods for our life, but for a\nvirtuous and religious one to ourselves; whence also that assertion of\nCicero, in the person of Cotta, that, since every man acquires virtue for\nhimself, none of the wise men have ever thanked God for it. “For,” says\nhe, “we are praised for virtue, and in virtue we glory; which would not be\nthe case, if it were a gift of God, and did not originate from ourselves.”\nAnd a little after: “This is the judgment of all men, that fortune must be\nasked of God, but that wisdom must be derived from ourselves.” This, then,\nis the substance of the opinion of all the philosophers, that the reason\nof the human understanding is sufficient for its proper government; that\nthe will, being subject to it, is indeed solicited by sense to evil\nobjects, but, as it has a free choice, there can be no impediment to its\nfollowing reason as its guide in all things.\nIV. Among the ecclesiastical writers, though there has not been one who\nwould not acknowledge both that human reason is grievously wounded by sin,\nand that the will is very much embarrassed by corrupt affections, yet many\nof them have followed the philosophers far beyond what is right. The early\nfathers appear to me to have thus extolled human power from a fear lest,\nif they openly confessed its impotence, they might, in the first place,\nincur the derision of the philosophers, with whom they were then\ncontending; and, in the next place, might administer to the flesh, of\nitself naturally too torpid to all that is good, a fresh occasion of\nslothfulness. To avoid delivering any principle deemed absurd in the\ncommon opinion of mankind, they made it their study, therefore, to\ncompromise between the doctrine of the Scripture and the dogmas of the\nphilosophers. Yet it appears from their language, that they principally\nregarded the latter consideration, that they might leave no room for\nslothfulness. Chrysostom says, “Since God has placed good and evil things\nin our power, he has given us freedom of choice; and he constrains not the\nunwilling, but embraces the willing.” Again: “Oftentimes a bad man, if he\nwill, is changed into a good one; and a good one falls into inactivity,\nand becomes bad; because God has given us naturally a free will, and\nimposes no necessity upon us, but, having provided suitable remedies,\npermits the event to depend entirely on the mind of the patient.” Again:\n“As without the assistance of Divine grace we can never do any thing\naright, so unless we bring what is our own, we shall never be able to gain\nthe favour of heaven.” He had before said, “That it may not be entirely of\nthe Divine assistance, it behoves us also to bring something.” And this is\nan expression very familiar with him: “Let us bring what is ours; God will\nsupply the rest.” Agreeably to which Jerome says, “That it belongs to us\nto begin, and to God to complete; that it is ours to offer what we can,\nbut his to supply our deficiencies.” In these sentences you see they\ncertainly attributed to man more than could justly be attributed to him\ntowards the pursuit of virtue; because they supposed it impossible to\nawaken our innate torpor, otherwise than by arguing that this alone\nconstitutes our guilt; but with what great dexterity they did it, we shall\nsee in the course of our work. That the passages which we have recited are\nexceedingly erroneous, will be shortly proved. Although the Greeks, beyond\nall others, and among them particularly Chrysostom, have exceeded all\nbounds in extolling the ability of the human will, yet such are the\nvariations, fluctuations, or obscurities of all the fathers, except\nAugustine, on this subject, that scarcely any thing certain can be\nconcluded from their writings. Therefore we shall not scrupulously\nenumerate the particular opinions of them all, but shall at times select\nfrom one and another so much as the explication of the argument shall\nappear to require. Succeeding writers, being every one for himself\nambitious of the praise of subtlety in the defence of human nature,\ngradually and successively fell into opinions more and more erroneous;\ntill at length man was commonly supposed to be corrupted only in his\nsensual part, but to have his will in a great measure, and his reason\nentirely, unimpaired. In the mean time, it was proclaimed by every tongue,\nthat the natural talents in men were corrupted, but the supernatural taken\naway—an expression of Augustine, of the import of which scarcely one man\nin a hundred had the slightest idea. For myself, if I meant clearly to\nstate wherein the corruption of nature consists, I could easily content\nmyself with this language. But it is of great importance to examine with\nattention what ability is retained by man in his present state, corrupted\nin all the parts of his nature, and deprived of supernatural gifts. This\nsubject, therefore, has been treated in too philosophical a manner by\nthose who gloried in being the disciples of Christ. For the Latins have\nalways retained the term _free will_, as though man still remained in his\nprimitive integrity. And the Greeks have not been ashamed to use an\nexpression much more arrogant; for they called it αυτεξουσιον, denoting\nthat man possesses sovereign power over himself. Since all men, therefore,\neven the vulgar, are tinctured with this principle, that man is endued\nwith free will, and some of those who would be thought intelligent know\nnot how far this freedom extends,—let us first examine the meaning of the\nterm, and then let us describe, according to the simplicity of the\nScripture, the power which man naturally possesses to do either good or\nevil. What _free will_ is, though the expression frequently occurs in all\nwriters, few have defined. Yet Origen appears to have advanced a position\nto which they all assented, when he calls it a power of _reason_ to\ndiscern good and evil, of _will_ to choose either. Nor does Augustine\ndiffer from him, when he teaches that it is a power of reason and will, by\nwhich good is chosen when grace assists; and evil, when grace is wanting.\nBernard, while he affects greater subtlety, has expressed himself with\nmore obscurity: he says, it is a consent on account of the liberty of\nwill, which cannot be lost, and the judgment of reason, which cannot be\navoided. The definition of Anselm is not sufficiently plain, who states it\nto be a power of preserving rectitude for its own sake. Therefore Peter\nLombard and the schoolmen have rather adopted the definition of Augustine,\nbecause it was more explicit, and did not exclude the grace of God,\nwithout which they perceived that the will had no power of itself. But\nthey also make such additions of their own, as they conceived to be either\nbetter, or conducive to further explication. First, they agree that the\nword _arbitrium_, _will_ or _choice_, should rather be referred to reason,\nwhose office it is to discern between good and evil; and that the epithet\n_free_ belongs properly to the faculty of the will, which is capable of\nbeing inclined to either. Wherefore, since liberty belongs properly to the\nwill, Thomas Aquinas says, that it would be a very good definition, if\nfree will were called _an elective power_, which, being composed of\nunderstanding and appetite, inclines rather to appetite. We see where they\nrepresent the power of free will to be placed; that is, in the reason and\nwill. It now remains briefly to inquire how much they attribute\nrespectively to each.\nV. Common and external things, which do not pertain to the kingdom of God,\nthey generally consider as subject to the free determination of man; but\ntrue righteousness they refer to the special grace of God and spiritual\nregeneration. With a view to support this notion, the author of the\ntreatise “On the Vocation of the Gentiles” enumerates three kinds of\nwill—the first a sensitive, the second an animal, and the third a\nspiritual one; the two former of which he states to be freely exercised by\nus, and the last to be the work of the Holy Spirit in us. The truth or\nfalsehood of this shall be discussed in the proper place; for my design at\npresent is briefly to recite the opinions of others, not to refute them.\nHence, when writers treat of free will, their first inquiry respects not\nits ability in civil or external actions, but its power to obey the Divine\nlaw. Though I confess the latter to be the principal question, yet I think\nthe other ought not to be wholly neglected; and for this opinion I hope to\ngive a very good reason. But a distinction has prevailed in the schools,\nwhich enumerates three kinds of liberty—the first, freedom from necessity,\nthe second, freedom from sin, the third, freedom from misery; of which the\nfirst is naturally inherent in man, so that nothing can ever deprive him\nof it: the other two are lost by sin. This distinction I readily admit,\nexcept that it improperly confounds necessity with coaction. And the wide\ndifference between these things, with the necessity of its being\nconsidered, will appear in another place.\nVI. This being admitted will place it beyond all doubt, that man is not\npossessed of free will for good works, unless he be assisted by grace, and\nthat special grace which is bestowed on the elect alone in regeneration.\nFor I stop not to notice those fanatics, who pretend that grace is offered\nequally and promiscuously to all. But it does not yet appear, whether he\nis altogether deprived of power to do good, or whether he yet possesses\nsome power, though small and feeble; which of itself can do nothing, but\nby the assistance of grace does also perform its part. Lombard, in order\nto establish this notion, informs us that two sorts of grace are necessary\nto qualify us for the performance of good works. One he calls operative,\nby which we efficaciously will what is good; the other coöperative, which\nattends as auxiliary to a good will. This division I dislike, because,\nwhile he attributes an efficacious desire of what is good to the grace of\nGod, he insinuates that man has of his own nature antecedent, though\nineffectual, desires after what is good; as Bernard asserts that a good\nwill is the work of God, but yet allows that man is self‐impelled to\ndesire such a good will. But this is very remote from the meaning of\nAugustine, from whom, however, Lombard would be thought to have borrowed\nthis division. The second part of it offends me by its ambiguity, which\nhas produced a very erroneous interpretation. For they have supposed that\nwe coöperate with the second sort of Divine grace, because we have it in\nour power either to frustrate the first sort by rejecting it, or to\nconfirm it by our obedience to it. The author of the treatise “On the\nVocation of the Gentiles” expresses it thus—that those who have the use of\nreason and judgment are at liberty to depart from grace, that they may be\nrewarded for not having departed, and that what is impossible without the\ncoöperation of the Spirit, may be imputed to their merits, by whose will\nit might have been prevented. These two things I have thought proper to\nnotice as I proceed, that the reader may perceive how much I dissent from\nthe sounder schoolmen. For I differ considerably more from the later\nsophists, as they have departed much further from the judgment of\nantiquity. However, we understand from this division, in what sense they\nhave ascribed free will to man. For Lombard at length pronounces, that we\nare not therefore possessed of free will, because we have an equal power\nto do or to think either good or evil, but only because we are free from\nconstraint. And this liberty is not diminished, although we are corrupt,\nand the slaves of sin, and capable of doing nothing but sin.\nVII. Then man will be said to possess free will in this sense, not that he\nhas an equally free election of good and evil, but because he does evil\nvoluntarily, and not by constraint. That, indeed, is very true; but what\nend could it answer to decorate a thing so diminutive with a title so\nsuperb? Egregious liberty indeed, if man be not compelled to serve sin,\nbut yet is such a willing slave, that his will is held in bondage by the\nfetters of sin. I really abominate contentions about words, which disturb\nthe Church without producing any good effect; but I think that we ought\nreligiously to avoid words which signify any absurdity, particularly when\nthey lead to a pernicious error. How few are there, pray, who, when they\nhear free will attributed to man, do not immediately conceive, that he has\nthe sovereignty over his own mind and will, and is able by his innate\npower to incline himself to whatever he pleases? But it will be said, all\ndanger from these expressions will be removed, if the people are carefully\napprized of their signification. But, on the contrary, the human mind is\nnaturally so prone to falsehood, that it will sooner imbibe error from one\nsingle expression, than truth from a prolix oration; of which we have a\nmore certain experiment than could be wished in this very word. For\nneglecting that explanation of the fathers, almost all their successors\nhave been drawn into a fatal self‐confidence, by adhering to the original\nand proper signification of the word.\nVIII. But if we regard the authority of the fathers—though they have the\nterm continually in their mouths, they at the same time declare with what\nextent of signification they use it. First of all, Augustine, who\nhesitates not to call the will a slave. He expresses his displeasure in\none place against those who deny free will; but he declares the principal\nreason for it, when he says, “Only let no man dare so to deny the freedom\nof the will, as to desire to excuse sin.” Elsewhere he plainly confesses,\nthat the human will is not free without the Spirit, since it is subject to\nits lusts, by which it is conquered and bound. Again: that when the will\nwas overcome by the sin into which it fell, nature began to be destitute\nof liberty. Again: that man, having made a wrong use of his free will,\nlost both it and himself. Again: that free will is in a state of\ncaptivity, so that it can do nothing towards righteousness. Again: that\nthe will cannot be free, which has not been liberated by Divine grace.\nAgain: that the Divine justice is not fulfilled, while the law commands,\nand man acts from his own strength; but when the Spirit assists, and the\nhuman will obeys, not as being free, but as liberated by God. And he\nbriefly assigns the cause of all this, when, in another place, he tells\nus, that man at his creation received great strength of free will, but\nlost it by sin. Therefore, having shown that free will is the result of\ngrace, he sharply inveighs against those who arrogate it to themselves\nwithout grace. “How, then,” says he, “do miserable men dare to be proud of\nfree will, before they are liberated, or of their own strength, if they\nhave been liberated?” Nor do they consider that the term _free will_\nsignifies liberty. But “where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is\nliberty.”(560) If, therefore, they are the slaves of sin, why do they\nboast of free will? “For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he\nbrought in bondage.”(561) But if they have been liberated, why do they\nboast as of their own work? Are they so much at liberty as to refuse to be\nthe servants of him who says, “Without me ye can do nothing”?(562)\nBesides, in another place, also, he seems to discountenance the use of\nthat expression, when he says that the will is free, but not liberated;\nfree from righteousness, enslaved to sin. This sentiment he also repeats\nand applies in another place, where he maintains that man is not free from\nrighteousness, but by the choice of his will, and that he is not made free\nfrom sin, but by the grace of the Saviour. He who declares that human\nliberty is nothing but an emancipation or manumission from righteousness,\nevidently exposes it to ridicule as an unmeaning term. Therefore, if any\nman allows himself the use of this term without any erroneous\nsignification, he will not be troubled by me on that account: but because\nI think that it cannot be retained without great danger, and that, on the\ncontrary, its abolition would be very beneficial to the Church, I would\nneither use it myself, nor wish it to be used by others who may consult my\nopinion.\nIX. Perhaps I may be thought to have raised a great prejudice against\nmyself, by confessing that all the ecclesiastical writers, except\nAugustine, have treated this subject with such ambiguities or variations,\nthat nothing certain can be learned from their writings. For some will\ninterpret this, as though I intended to deprive them of the right of\ngiving their suffrages, because their opinions are all adverse to mine.\nBut I have had no other object in view than simply and faithfully to\nconsult the benefit of pious minds, who, if they wait to discover the\nsentiments of the fathers on this subject, will fluctuate in perpetual\nuncertainty. At one time they teach man, despoiled of all strength of free\nwill, to have recourse to grace alone; at another, they either furnish, or\nappear to furnish, him with armour naturally his own. Yet that, amidst all\nthis ambiguity of expression, esteeming the strength of man as little or\nnothing, they have ascribed the praise of every thing that is good\nentirely to the Holy Spirit, is not difficult to prove, if I introduce\nsome passages from them, in which this sentiment is clearly maintained.\nFor what is the meaning of that assertion of Cyprian, so frequently\ncelebrated by Augustine, “That we ought to glory in nothing, because we\nhave nothing of our own;” but that man, completely impoverished in\nhimself, should learn to depend entirely on God? What is the meaning of\nthat observation of Augustine and Eucherius, when they represent Christ as\nthe tree of life, to whom whosoever shall have stretched forth his hand\nshall live; and free will as the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and\nsay that whosoever forsakes the grace of God and tastes of it shall die?\nWhat is the meaning of that assertion of Chrysostom, that every man by\nnature is not only a sinner, but altogether sin? If we have not one good\nquality, if from his head to his feet man be entirely sin, if it be wrong\neven to try how far the power of the will extends,—how, then, can it be\nright to divide the praise of a good work between God and man? I could\nintroduce many such passages from other fathers; but lest any one should\ncavil, that I select only those things which favour my own cause, but\nartfully omit those which oppose it, I refrain from such a recital. I\nventure to affirm, however, that though they sometimes too highly extol\nfree will, yet their design was to teach man to discard all reliance on\nhis own power, and to consider all his strength as residing in God alone.\nI now proceed to a simple explication of the truth in considering the\nnature of man.\nX. But I am obliged to repeat here, what I premised in the beginning of\nthis chapter—that he who feels the most consternation, from a\nconsciousness of his own calamity, poverty, nakedness, and ignominy, has\nmade the greatest proficiency in the knowledge of himself. For there is no\ndanger that man will divest himself of too much, provided he learns that\nwhat is wanting in him may be recovered in God. But he cannot assume to\nhimself even the least particle beyond his just right, without ruining\nhimself with vain confidence, and incurring the guilt of enormous\nsacrilege, by transferring to himself the honour which belongs to God. And\nwhenever our minds are pestered with this cupidity, to desire to have\nsomething of our own, which may reside in ourselves rather than in God, we\nmay know that this idea is suggested by the same counsellor, who excited\nin our first parents the desire of resembling “gods, knowing good and\nevil.”(563) If that term be diabolical, which exalts man in his own\nopinion, let us not admit it, unless we wish to take the counsel of an\nenemy. It is pleasant, indeed, to have so much innate strength as to\nconfide in and be satisfied with ourselves. But from being allured into\nthis vain confidence, let us be deterred by the many awful sentences which\nseverely humble us to the dust; such as “Cursed be the man that trusteth\nin man, and maketh flesh his arm.”(564) Again: “God delighteth not in the\nstrength of the horse; he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. The\nLord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his\nmercy.”(565) Again: “He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have\nno might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary,\nand the young men shall utterly fall; but they that wait upon the Lord\nshall renew their strength.”(566) The tendency of all which is to prevent\nus from depending, in the smallest degree, on our own strength, if we wish\nGod to be propitious to us, who “resisteth the proud, but giveth grace\nunto the humble.”(567) Then let us remember these promises; “I will pour\nwater upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground:”(568)\nagain; “Ho! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters:”(569) which\ndeclare, that none are admitted to a participation of the blessings of\nGod, but those who are pining away with a sense of their own poverty. Nor\nshould such promises as this of Isaiah be overlooked: “The sun shall be no\nmore thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light\nunto thee; but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light.”(570) The\nLord certainly does not deprive his servants of the splendour of the sun\nor of the moon; but because he will appear exclusively glorious in them,\nhe calls off their confidence to a great distance, even from those things\nwhich in their opinion are the most excellent.\nXI. I have always, indeed, been exceedingly pleased with this observation\nof Chrysostom, that humility is the foundation of our philosophy; but\nstill more with this of Augustine: “As a rhetorician,” says he, “on being\ninterrogated what was the first thing in the rules of eloquence, replied,\n‘Pronunciation;’ and on being separately interrogated what was the second,\nand what was the third, gave the same reply; so, should any one\ninterrogate me concerning the rules of the Christian religion, the first,\nsecond, and third, I would always reply, Humility.” Now, he does not\nconsider it as humility, when a man, conscious to himself of some little\npower, abstains from pride and haughtiness; but when he truly feels his\ncondition to be such that he has no refuge but in humility, as he\nelsewhere declares. “Let no man,” says he, “flatter himself: of himself he\nis a devil: every blessing he enjoys is only from God. For what have you\nthat is your own, but sin? Take to yourself sin, which is your own; for\nrighteousness belongs to God.” Again: “Why do men so presume on the\nability of nature? It is wounded, maimed, distressed, and ruined. It needs\na true confession, not a false defence.” Again: “When every one knows,\nthat in himself he is nothing, and that he cannot assist himself, the arms\nare broken within him, and the contentions are subsided.” But it is\nnecessary that all the weapons of impiety should be broken in pieces and\nconsumed, that you may remain unarmed, and have no help in yourself. The\ngreater your weakness is in yourself, so much the more the Lord assists\nyou. So in the seventieth Psalm he forbids us to remember our own\nrighteousness, that we may know the righteousness of God; and shows that\nGod so recommends his grace to us, that we may know that we are nothing,\nand are solely dependent on the Divine mercy, being of ourselves\naltogether evil. Here, then, let us not contend with God concerning our\nright, as though what is attributed to him were deducted from our welfare.\nFor as our humility is his exaltation, so the confession of our humility\nhas an immediate remedy in his commiseration. Now, I do not expect that a\nman unconvinced should voluntarily submit, and, if he has any strength,\nwithdraw his attention from it to be reduced to true humility; but I\nrequire, that, discarding the malady of self‐love and love of strife,\nwhich blinds him, and leads him to entertain too high an opinion of\nhimself, he should seriously contemplate himself in the faithful mirror of\nthe Scripture.\nXII. And, indeed, I much approve of that common observation which has been\nborrowed from Augustine, that the natural talents in man have been\ncorrupted by sin, but that of the supernatural ones he has been wholly\ndeprived. For by the latter are intended, both the light of faith and\nrighteousness, which would be sufficient for the attainment of a heavenly\nlife and eternal felicity. Therefore, when he revolted from the Divine\ngovernment, he was at the same time deprived of those supernatural\nendowments, which had been given him for the hope of eternal salvation.\nHence it follows, that he is exiled from the kingdom of God, in such a\nmanner, that all the affections relating to the happy life of the soul,\nare also extinguished in him, till he recovers them by the grace of\nregeneration. Such are faith, love to God, charity towards our neighbours,\nand an attachment to holiness and righteousness. All these things, being\nrestored by Christ, are esteemed adventitious and preternatural; and\ntherefore we conclude that they had been lost. Again, soundness of mind\nand rectitude of heart were also destroyed; and this is the corruption of\nthe natural talents. For although we retain some portion of understanding\nand judgment together with the will, yet we cannot say that our mind is\nperfect and sound, which is oppressed with debility and immersed in\nprofound darkness; and the depravity of our will is sufficiently known.\nReason, therefore, by which man distinguishes between good and evil, by\nwhich he understands and judges, being a natural talent, could not be\ntotally destroyed, but is partly debilitated, partly vitiated, so that it\nexhibits nothing but deformity and ruin. In this sense John says, that\n“the light” still “shineth in darkness,” but that “the darkness\ncomprehendeth it not.”(571) In this passage both these ideas are clearly\nexpressed—that some sparks continue to shine in the nature of man, even in\nits corrupt and degenerate state, which prove him to be a rational\ncreature, and different from the brutes, because he is endued with\nunderstanding; and yet that this light is smothered by so much ignorance,\nthat it cannot act with any degree of efficacy. So the will, being\ninseparable from the nature of man, is not annihilated; but it is fettered\nby depraved and inordinate desires, so that it cannot aspire after any\nthing that is good. This, indeed, is a complete definition, but requires\nmore diffuse explication. Therefore, that the order of our discourse may\nproceed according to the distinction we have stated, in which we divided\nthe soul into understanding and will, let us first examine the power of\nthe understanding. To condemn it to perpetual blindness, so as to leave it\nno intelligence in any thing, is repugnant, not only to the Divine word,\nbut also to the experience of common sense. For we perceive in the mind of\nman some desire of investigating truth, towards which he would have no\ninclination, but from some relish of it previously possessed. It therefore\nindicates some perspicuity in the human understanding, that it is\nattracted with a love of truth; the neglect of which in the brutes argues\ngross sense without reason; although this desire, small as it is, faints\neven before its entrance on its course, because it immediately terminates\nin vanity. For the dulness of the human mind renders it incapable of\npursuing the right way of investigating the truth; it wanders through a\nvariety of errors, and groping, as it were, in the shades of darkness,\noften stumbles, till at length it is lost in its wanderings; thus, in its\nsearch after truth, it betrays its incapacity to seek and find it. It also\nlabours under another grievous malady, frequently not discerning what\nthose things are, the true knowledge of which it would be proper to\nattain, and therefore torments itself with a ridiculous curiosity in\nfruitless and unimportant inquiries. To things most necessary to be known\nit either never adverts, or contemptuously and rarely digresses; but\nscarcely ever studies them with serious application. This depravity being\na common subject of complaint with heathen writers, all men are clearly\nproved to have been implicated in it. Wherefore Solomon, in his\nEcclesiastes, after having enumerated those pursuits in which men consider\nthemselves as displaying superior wisdom, concludes with pronouncing them\nto be vain and frivolous.\nXIII. Yet its attempts are not always so fruitless, but that it makes some\ndiscoveries, particularly when it applies itself to inferior things. Nor\nis it so stupid, as to be without some slender notion also of superior\nones, however negligently it attends to the investigation of them; but it\npossesses not an equal ability for both. For it is when it goes beyond the\nlimits of the present life, that it is chiefly convinced of its own\nimbecility. Wherefore, that we may better perceive how far it proceeds in\nevery case according to the degrees of its ability, it will be useful for\nus to propose the following distinction; that there is one understanding\nfor terrestrial things, and another for celestial ones. I call those\nthings terrestrial which do not pertain to God and his kingdom, to true\nrighteousness, or to the blessedness of a future life; but which relate\nentirely to the present life, and are in some sense confined within the\nlimits of it. Celestial things are the pure knowledge of God, the method\nof true righteousness, and the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom. In the\nfirst class are included civil polity, domestic economy, all the\nmechanical arts and liberal sciences; in the second, the knowledge of God\nand of the Divine will, and the rule for conformity to it in our lives.\nNow, in regard to the first class, it must be confessed, that as man is\nnaturally a creature inclined to society, he has also by nature an\ninstinctive propensity to cherish and preserve that society; and therefore\nwe perceive in the minds of all men general impressions of civil probity\nand order. Hence it is that not a person can be found who does not\nunderstand, that all associations of men ought to be governed by laws, or\nwho does not conceive in his mind the principles of those laws. Hence that\nperpetual consent of all nations, as well as all individuals, to the laws,\nbecause the seeds of them are innate in all mankind, without any\ninstructor or legislator. I regard not the dissensions and contests which\nafterwards arise, while some desire to invert all justice and propriety,\nto break down the barriers of the laws, and to substitute mere cupidity in\nthe room of justice, as is the case with thieves and robbers. Others—which\nis a fault more common—think that unjust which legislators have sanctioned\nas just; and, on the contrary, pronounce that to be laudable which they\nhave forbidden. For the former of these hate not the laws from an\nignorance that they are good and sacred; but, inflamed with the violence\nof their passions, manifestly contend against reason, and under the\ninfluence of their lawless desires, execrate that which their judgments\napprove. The controversy of the latter of these is by no means repugnant\nto that original idea of equity which we have mentioned; for when men\ndispute with each other on the comparative merits of different laws, it\nimplies their consent to some general rule of equity. This clearly argues\nthe debility of the human mind, which halts and staggers even when it\nappears to follow the right way. Yet it is certainly true, that some seeds\nof political order are sown in the minds of all. And this is a powerful\nargument, that in the constitution of this life no man is destitute of the\nlight of reason.\nXIV. Next follow the arts, both liberal and manual; for learning which, as\nthere is in all of us a certain aptitude, they also discover the strength\nof human ingenuity. But though all men are not capable of learning every\nart, yet it is a very sufficient proof of the common energy, that scarcely\nan individual can be found, whose sagacity does not exert itself in some\nparticular art. Nor have they an energy and facility only in learning, but\nalso in inventing something new in every art, or in amplifying and\nimproving what they have learned from their predecessors. Though this\nexcited Plato erroneously to assert that such an apprehension is only a\nrecollection of what the soul knew in its preëxistent state, before it\ncame into the body, it constrains us, by the most cogent reasons, to\nacknowledge that the principle of it is innate in the human mind. These\ninstances, therefore, plainly prove, that men are endued with a general\napprehension of reason and understanding. Yet it is such a universal\nblessing, that every one for himself ought to acknowledge it as the\npeculiar favour of God. To this gratitude the Author of nature himself\nabundantly excites us, by his creation of idiots, in whom he represents\nthe state of the human soul without his illumination, which, though\nnatural to all, is nevertheless a gratuitous gift of his beneficence\ntowards every individual. But the invention and methodical teaching of\nthese arts, and the more intimate and excellent knowledge of them, which\nis peculiar to a few, are no solid argument of general perspicacity; yet,\nbelonging to both the pious and the impious, they are justly numbered\namong the natural talents.\nXV. Whenever, therefore, we meet with heathen writers, let us learn from\nthat light of truth which is admirably displayed in their works, that the\nhuman mind, fallen as it is, and corrupted from its integrity, is yet\ninvested and adorned by God with excellent talents. If we believe that the\nSpirit of God is the only fountain of truth, we shall neither reject nor\ndespise the truth itself, wherever it shall appear, unless we wish to\ninsult the Spirit of God; for the gifts of the Spirit cannot be\nundervalued without offering contempt and reproach to the Spirit himself.\nNow, shall we deny the light of truth to the ancient lawyers, who have\ndelivered such just principles of civil order and polity? Shall we say\nthat the philosophers were blind in their exquisite contemplation and in\ntheir scientific description of nature? Shall we say that those, who by\nthe art of logic have taught us to speak in a manner consistent with\nreason, were destitute of understanding themselves? Shall we accuse those\nof insanity, who by the study of medicine have been exercising their\nindustry for our advantage? What shall we say of all the mathematics?\nShall we esteem them the delirious ravings of madmen? On the contrary, we\nshall not be able even to read the writings of the ancients on these\nsubjects without great admiration; we shall admire them, because we shall\nbe constrained to acknowledge them to be truly excellent. And shall we\nesteem any thing laudable or excellent, which we do not recognize as\nproceeding from God? Let us, then, be ashamed of such great ingratitude,\nwhich was not to be charged on the heathen poets, who confessed that\nphilosophy, and legislation, and useful arts, were the inventions of their\ngods. Therefore, since it appears that those whom the Scripture styles\n“natural men,” ψυχικους, have discovered such acuteness and perspicacity\nin the investigation of sublunary things, let us learn from such examples,\nhow many good qualities the Lord has left to the nature of man, since it\nhas been despoiled of what is truly good.\nXVI. Yet let us not forget that these are most excellent gifts of the\nDivine Spirit, which for the common benefit of mankind he dispenses to\nwhomsoever he pleases. For if it was necessary that the Spirit of God\nshould infuse into Bezaleel and Aholiab the understanding and skill\nrequisite for the construction of the tabernacle,(572) we need not wonder\nif the knowledge of those things, which are most excellent in human life,\nis said to be communicated to us by the Spirit of God. Nor is there any\nreason for inquiring, what intercourse with the Spirit is enjoyed by the\nimpious who are entirely alienated from God. For when the Spirit of God is\nsaid to dwell only in the faithful, that is to be understood of the Spirit\nof sanctification, by whom we are consecrated as temples to God himself.\nYet it is equally by the energy of the same Spirit, that God replenishes,\nactuates, and quickens all creatures, and that, according to the property\nof each species which he has given it by the law of creation. Now, if it\nhas pleased the Lord that we should be assisted in physics, logic,\nmathematics, and other arts and sciences, by the labour and ministry of\nthe impious, let us make use of them; lest, if we neglect to use the\nblessings therein freely offered to us by God, we suffer the just\npunishment of our negligence. But, lest any one should suppose a man to be\ntruly happy, when he is admitted to possess such powerful energies for the\ndiscovery of truth relating to the elements of this world, it must\nlikewise be added, that all that faculty of understanding, and the\nunderstanding which is the consequence of it, is, in the sight of God, a\nfleeting and transitory thing, where there is not a solid foundation of\ntruth. For the sentiment of Augustine, with whom, as we have observed, the\nMaster of the Sentences and the Schoolmen have been constrained to\ncoincide, is strictly true—that as the gratuitous or supernatural gifts\nwere taken away from man after the fall, so these natural ones which\nremained have been corrupted; not that they can be defiled in themselves\nas proceeding from God, but because they have ceased to be pure to\npolluted man, so that he can obtain no praise from them.\nXVII. Let us conclude, therefore, that it is evident in all mankind, that\nreason is a peculiar property of our nature, which distinguishes us from\nthe brute animals, as sense constitutes the difference between them and\nthings inanimate. For whereas some are born fools and idiots, that defect\nobscures not the general goodness of God. Such a spectacle should rather\nteach us that what we retain ought justly to be ascribed to his\nindulgence; because, had it not been for his mercy to us, our defection\nwould have been followed by the total destruction of our nature. But\nwhereas some excel in penetration, others possess superior judgment, and\nothers have a greater aptitude to learn this or that art, in this variety\nGod displays his goodness to us, that no one may arrogate to himself as\nhis own what proceeds merely from the Divine liberality. For whence is it\nthat one is more excellent than another, unless it be to exalt in our\ncommon nature the special goodness of God, which in the preterition of\nmany, proclaims that it is under an obligation to none? Moreover, God\ninspires particular motions according to the vocation of each individual;\nof which many examples occur in the book of the Judges, where the Spirit\nof the Lord is said to “come upon” those whom he called to govern the\npeople.(573) Finally, in all important actions there is a special\ninstinct; for which reason it is said that Saul was followed by valiant\nmen, “whose hearts God had touched.”(574) And Samuel, when he predicts his\ninauguration into the kingdom, thus expresses himself: “The Spirit of the\nLord will come upon thee, and thou shalt be turned into another man.”(575)\nAnd this is extended to the whole course of his government; as it is\nafterwards narrated concerning David, that “the Spirit of the Lord came\nupon him from that day forward.”(576) But the same expression is used in\nother places in reference to particular impulses. Even in Homer, men are\nsaid to excel in abilities, not only as Jupiter has distributed to every\none, but according as he guides him from day to day. And experience\nclearly shows, since the most ingenious and sagacious of mankind\nfrequently stand still in profound astonishment, that the minds of men are\nsubject to the power and will of God to govern them every moment; for\nwhich reason it is said, that “he taketh away the heart of the chief\npeople of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where\nthere is no way.”(577) Yet in this diversity we perceive some remaining\nmarks of the Divine image, which distinguish the human race in general\nfrom all the other creatures.\nXVIII. We now proceed to show what human reason can discover, when it\ncomes to the kingdom of God, and to that spiritual wisdom, which consists\nchiefly in three things—to know God, his paternal favour towards us, on\nwhich depends our salvation, and the method of regulating our lives\naccording to the rule of the law. In the two first points, but especially\nin the second, the most sagacious of mankind are blinder than moles. I do\nnot deny that some judicious and apposite observations concerning God may\nbe found scattered in the writings of the philosophers; but they always\nbetray a confused imagination. The Lord afforded them, as we have before\nobserved, some slight sense of his Divinity, that they might not be able\nto plead ignorance as an excuse for impiety, and sometimes impelled them\nto utter things, by the confession of which they might themselves be\nconvinced. But they saw the objects presented to their view in such a\nmanner, that by the sight they were not even directed to the truth, much\nless did they arrive at it; just as a man, who is travelling by night\nacross a field, sees the coruscations of lightning extending for a moment\nfar and wide, but with such an evanescent view, that so far from being\nassisted by them in proceeding on his journey, he is re‐absorbed in the\ndarkness of the night before he can advance a single step. Besides, those\nfew truths, with which they, as it were, fortuitously besprinkle their\nbooks, with what numerous and monstrous falsehoods are they defiled!\nLastly, they never had the smallest idea of that certainty of the Divine\nbenevolence towards us, without which the human understanding must\nnecessarily be full of immense confusion. Human reason, then, neither\napproaches, nor tends, nor directs its views towards this truth, to\nunderstand who is the true God, or in what character he will manifest\nhimself to us.\nXIX. But because, from our being intoxicated with a false opinion of our\nown perspicacity, we do not without great difficulty suffer ourselves to\nbe persuaded, that in Divine things our reason is totally blind and\nstupid, it will be better, I think, to confirm it by testimonies of\nScripture, than to support it by arguments. This is beautifully taught by\nJohn, in that passage which I lately cited, where he says that, from the\nbeginning, “in God was life, and the life was the light of men. And the\nlight shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”(578) He\nindicates, indeed, that the soul of man is irradiated with a beam of\nDivine light, so that it is never wholly destitute either of some little\nflame, or at least of a spark of it; but he likewise suggests that it\ncannot comprehend God by that illumination. And this because all his\nsagacity, as far as respects the knowledge of God, is mere blindness. For\nwhen the Spirit calls men “darkness,” he at once totally despoils them of\nthe faculty of spiritual understanding. Wherefore he asserts that\nbelievers, who receive Christ, are “born not of blood, nor of the will of\nthe flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;”(579) as though he had said\nthat the flesh is not capable of such sublime wisdom as to conceive of God\nand Divine things, without being illuminated by the Spirit of God; as\nChrist testified that his being known by Peter was owing to a special\nrevelation of the Father.(580)\nXX. If we were firmly persuaded of what, indeed, ought not to be\nquestioned, that our nature is destitute of all those things which our\nheavenly Father confers on his elect through the Spirit of regeneration,\nhere would be no cause of hesitation. For this is the language of the\nfaithful by the mouth of the Prophet: “With thee is the fountain of life;\nin thy light we shall see light.”(581) The Apostle confirms the same, when\nhe says that “no man can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy\nGhost.”(582) And John the Baptist, perceiving the stupidity of his\ndisciples, exclaims, that “a man can receive nothing except it be given\nhim from above.”(583) That by “gift” he intends a special illumination,\nnot a common faculty of nature, is evident from the complaint which he\nmakes of the inefficacy of the many discourses in which he had recommended\nChrist to his disciples. “I see that words are unavailing to instruct the\nminds of men in Divine things, unless God give them understanding by his\nSpirit.” And Moses also, when he reproaches the people for their\nforgetfulness, yet at the same time remarks, that they cannot be wise in\nthe mysteries of God but by the Divine favour. He says, “Thine eyes have\nseen the signs and those great miracles; yet the Lord hath not given you a\nheart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear.”(584) What more\nwould he express, if he had called them blockheads, destitute of all\nunderstanding in the consideration of the works of God? Whence the Lord,\nby the Prophet, promises, as an instance of peculiar grace, that he will\ngive the Israelites “a heart to know” him;(585) plainly suggesting that\nthe mind of man has no spiritual wisdom any further than as it is\nenlightened by him. Christ also has clearly confirmed this by his own\ndeclaration, that no man can come to him, except the Father draw him.(586)\nWhat! is he not himself the lively image of the Father, representing to us\nall “the brightness of his glory”?(587) Therefore, he could not better\nmanifest the extent of our capacity for the knowledge of God, than when he\naffirms that we have no eyes to behold his image where it is so plainly\nexhibited. What! did he not descend to the earth in order to discover to\nmen the will of the Father? And did he not faithfully fulfil the object of\nhis mission? He certainly did; but his preaching is not at all\nefficacious, unless the way to the heart be laid open by the internal\nteaching of the Spirit. Therefore, none come to him but they who have\nheard and learned of the Father. What is the nature of this hearing and\nlearning? It is when the Spirit, by a wonderful and peculiar power, forms\nthe ears to hear and the mind to understand. And lest this should appear\nstrange, he cites the prophecy of Isaiah, where, predicting the\nrestoration of the Church, he says, that all those who shall be saved\n“shall be taught of the Lord.” If God there predicts something peculiar\nconcerning his elect, it is evident that he speaks not of that kind of\ninstruction which is common also to the impious and profane. It must be\nconcluded, therefore, that there is no admission into the kingdom of God,\nbut for him whose mind has been renewed by the illumination of the Holy\nSpirit. But Paul expresses himself more clearly than all the others.\nHaving professedly entered upon this argument, after he has condemned all\nhuman wisdom as folly and vanity, and even reduced it to nothing, he comes\nto this conclusion: “The natural man receiveth not the things of the\nSpirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know\nthem, because they are spiritually discerned.”(588) Whom does he call the\nnatural man? him who depends on the light of nature. He, I say, has no\napprehension of the mysteries of God. Why so? because through slothfulness\nhe neglects them? Nay, even his utmost endeavours can avail nothing,\n“because they are spiritually discerned.” This implies, that being\nentirely concealed from human perspicacity, they are discovered only by\nthe revelation of the Spirit; so that where the illumination of the Spirit\nis not enjoyed, they are deemed foolishness itself. He had before extolled\n“the things which God hath prepared for them that love him”(589) above the\ncapacity of our eyes, our ears, and our minds; he had even asserted that\nhuman wisdom was a kind of veil, by which the mind is prevented from a\ndiscovery of God. What do we want more? The Apostle pronounces that “God\nhath made foolish the wisdom of this world;”(590) and shall we ascribe to\nit such a degree of sagacity, as would enable it to penetrate to God, and\nto the most secret recesses of the heavenly kingdom? Far be from us such\nextreme stupidity.\nXXI. That which he here detracts from men, he in another place ascribes\nexclusively to God. Praying for the Ephesians, he says, “May God, the\nFather of glory, give unto you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation.”(591)\nYou hear now that all wisdom and revelation is the gift of God. What\nfollows? “The eyes of your understanding being enlightened.” If they need\na new revelation, they are certainly blind of themselves. It follows,\n“that ye may know what is the hope of your calling,” &c. He confesses,\nthen, that the minds of men are not naturally capable of so great\nknowledge, as to know their own calling. Nor let any Pelagian here object,\nthat God assists this stupidity or ignorance, when, by the teaching of his\nword, he directs the human understanding to that which, without a guide,\nit never could have attained. For David had the law, in which all\ndesirable wisdom was comprised: yet, not content with this, he requested\nthat his eyes might be opened to consider the mysteries of that law.(592)\nBy this expression he clearly signifies, that the sun arises on the earth,\nwhere the word of God shines on mankind; but that they derive little\nadvantage from it, till he himself either gives them eyes or opens them,\nwho is therefore called “the Father of lights;”(593) because wherever he\nshines not by his Spirit, every thing is covered with darkness. Thus also\nthe Apostles were rightly and abundantly taught by the best of all\nteachers: yet, if they had not needed the Spirit of truth(594) to instruct\ntheir minds in that very doctrine which they had previously heard, they\nwould not have been commanded to expect him. If, in imploring any favour\nof God, we confess our need, and if his promising it argues our poverty,\nlet no man hesitate to acknowledge, that he is incapable of understanding\nthe mysteries of God, any further than he has been illuminated by Divine\ngrace. He who attributes to himself more understanding, is so much the\nblinder, because he does not perceive and acknowledge his blindness.\nXXII. It remains for us to notice the third branch of knowledge, relating\nto the rule for the proper regulation of our life, which we truly\ndenominate the knowledge of works of righteousness; in which the human\nmind discovers somewhat more acuteness than in the two former particulars.\nFor the Apostle declares, that “when the Gentiles, which have not the law,\ndo by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,\nare a law unto themselves; which show the work of the law written in their\nhearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean\nwhile accusing or else excusing one another.”(595) If the Gentiles have\nnaturally the righteousness of the law engraven on their minds, we\ncertainly cannot say that they are altogether ignorant how they ought to\nlive. And no sentiment is more commonly admitted, than that man is\nsufficiently instructed in a right rule of life by that natural law of\nwhich the Apostle there speaks. But let us examine for what purpose this\nknowledge of the law was given to men; and then it will appear how far it\ncan conduct them towards the mark of reason and truth. This is evident\nalso from the words of Paul, if we observe the connection of the passage.\nHe had just before said, “As many as have sinned without law, shall also\nperish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged\nby the law.” Because it might appear absurd that the Gentiles should\nperish without any previous knowledge, he immediately subjoins that their\nconscience supplies the place of a law to them, and is therefore\nsufficient for their just condemnation. The end of the law of nature,\ntherefore, is, that man may be rendered inexcusable. Nor will it be\nimproperly defined in this manner—That it is a sentiment of the conscience\nsufficiently discerning between good and evil, to deprive men of the\npretext of ignorance, while they are convicted even by their own\ntestimony. Such is the indulgence of man to himself, that in the\nperpetration of evil actions he always gladly diverts his mind as much as\nhe possibly can from all sense of sin; which seems to have induced Plato\nto suppose, that no sin is committed but through ignorance. This remark of\nhis would be correct, if the hypocrisy of men could go so far in the\nconcealment of their vices, as that the mind would have no consciousness\nof its guilt before God. But since the sinner, though he endeavours to\nevade the knowledge of good and evil imprinted on his mind, is frequently\nbrought back to it, and so is not permitted to shut his eyes, but\ncompelled, whether he will or not, sometimes to open them, there is no\ntruth in the assertion, that he sins only through ignorance.\nXXIII. Themistius, another philosopher, with more truth, teaches that the\nhuman understanding is very rarely deceived in the universal definition,\nor in the essence of a thing; but that it falls into error, when it\nproceeds further, and descends to the consideration of particular cases.\nThere is no man, who, if he be interrogated in a general way, will not\naffirm homicide to be criminal; but he who conspires the death of his\nenemy, deliberates on it as a good action. The adulterer will condemn\nadultery in general; but will privately flatter himself in his own. Here\nlies the ignorance—when a man, proceeding to a particular case, forgets\nthe rule which he had just fixed as a general position. This subject is\nvery excellently treated by Augustine, in his exposition of the first\nverse of the fifty‐seventh Psalm. The observation of Themistius, however,\nis not applicable to all cases; for sometimes the turpitude of the crime\nso oppresses the conscience of the sinner, that, no longer imposing on\nhimself under the false image of virtue, he rushes into evil with the\nknowledge of his mind and the consent of his will. This state of mind\nproduced these expressions, which we find in a heathen poet: “I see the\nbetter path, and approve it; I pursue the worse.” Wherefore the\ndistinction of Aristotle between incontinence and intemperance appears to\nme to be highly judicious. Where incontinence predominates, he says, that\nby the perturbation of the affections or passions, the mind is deprived of\nparticular knowledge, so that in its own evil actions it observes not that\ncriminality which it generally discovers in similar actions committed by\nother persons; and that when the perturbation has subsided, penitence\nimmediately succeeds; that intemperance is not extinguished or broken by a\nsense of sin, but, on the contrary, obstinately persists in the choice of\nevil which it has made.\nXXIV. Now, when you hear of a universal judgment in man to discriminate\nbetween good and evil, you must not imagine that it is every where sound\nand perfect. For if the hearts of men be furnished with a capacity of\ndiscriminating what is just and unjust, only that they may not excuse\nthemselves with the plea of ignorance, it is not at all necessary for them\nto discover the truth in every point; it is quite sufficient if they\nunderstand so much that they can avail themselves of no subterfuge, but\nbeing convicted by the testimony of their own conscience, even now begin\nto tremble at the tribunal of God. And if we will examine our reason by\nthe Divine law, which is the rule of perfect righteousness, we shall find\nin how many respects it is blind. It certainly is far from reaching the\nprincipal points in the first table; such as relate to trust in God,\nascribing to him the praise of goodness and righteousness, the invocation\nof his name, and the true observation of the Sabbath. What mind, relying\non its natural powers, ever imagined that the legitimate worship of God\nconsisted in these and similar things? For when profane men intend to\nworship God, though they are recalled a hundred times from their vain and\nnugatory fancies, yet they are always relapsing into them again. They deny\nthat sacrifices are pleasing to God, unaccompanied with sincerity of\nheart; thereby testifying that they have some ideas concerning the\nspiritual worship of God, which, nevertheless, they immediately corrupt by\ntheir false inventions. For it is impossible ever to persuade them that\nevery thing is true which the law prescribes concerning it. Shall I say\nthat the mind of man excels in discernment, which can neither understand\nof itself, nor hearken to good instructions? Of the precepts of the second\ntable it has a little clearer understanding, since they are more\nintimately connected with the preservation of civil society among men.\nThough even here it is sometimes found to be deficient; for to every noble\nmind it appears very absurd to submit to an unjust and imperious\ndespotism, if it be possible by any means to resist it. A uniform decision\nof human reason is, that it is the mark of a servile and abject\ndisposition patiently to bear it, and of an honest and ingenuous mind to\nshake it off. Nor is the revenging of injuries esteemed a vice among the\nphilosophers. But the Lord, condemning such excessive haughtiness of mind,\nprescribes to his people that patience which is deemed dishonourable among\nmen. But in the universal observation of the law, the censure of\nconcupiscence wholly escapes our notice. For the natural man cannot be\nbrought to acknowledge the disorders of his inward affections. The light\nof nature is smothered, before it approaches the first entrance of this\nabyss. For when the philosophers represent the inordinate affections of\nthe mind as vices, they intend those which appear and manifest themselves\nin the grosser external actions; but those corrupt desires which more\nsecretly stimulate the mind, they consider as nothing.\nXXV. Wherefore, as Plato has before been deservedly censured for imputing\nall sins to ignorance, so also we must reject the opinion of those who\nmaintain that all sins proceed from deliberate malice and pravity. For we\ntoo much experience how frequently we fall into error even when our\nintention is good. Our reason is overwhelmed with deceptions in so many\nforms, is obnoxious to so many errors, stumbles at so many impediments,\nand is embarrassed in so many difficulties, that it is very far from being\na certain guide. Paul shows its deficiency in the sight of the Lord in\nevery part of our life, when he denies “that we are sufficient of\nourselves to think any thing as of ourselves.”(596) He does not speak of\nthe will or of the affections, but he also divests us of every good\nthought, that we may not suppose it possible for our minds to conceive how\nany action may be rightly performed. Are all our industry, perspicacity,\nunderstanding, and care so depraved, that we cannot conceive or meditate\nany thing that is right in the sight of God? To us, who do not contentedly\nsubmit to be stripped of the acuteness of our reason, which we esteem our\nmost valuable endowment, this appears too harsh; but in the estimation of\nthe Holy Spirit, who knows that all the thoughts of the wisest of men are\nvain,(597) and who plainly pronounces every imagination of the human heart\nto be only evil,(598) such a representation is consistent with the\nstrictest truth. If whatever our mind conceives, agitates, undertakes, and\nperforms, be invariably evil, how can we entertain a thought of\nundertaking any thing acceptable to God, by whom nothing is accepted but\nholiness and righteousness? Thus it is evident that the reason of our\nmind, whithersoever it turns, is unhappily obnoxious to vanity. David was\nconscious to himself of this imbecility, when he prayed that understanding\nmight be given him, to enable him rightly to learn the commandments of the\nLord.(599) For his desire to obtain a new understanding implies the total\ninsufficiency of his own. And this he does not once, but almost ten times\nin one Psalm he repeats the same petition—a repetition indicating the\ngreatness of the necessity which urges him thus to pray. What David\nrequests for himself alone, Paul frequently supplicates for the churches\nat large. “We do not cease to pray for you,” says he, “and to desire, that\nye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and\nspiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all\npleasing.”(600) Whenever he represents that as a blessing of God, we\nshould remember that he thereby testifies it to be placed beyond the\nability of man. Augustine so far acknowledges this defect of reason in\nunderstanding the things of God, that he thinks the grace of illumination\nno less necessary to our minds than the light of the sun to our eyes. And\nnot content with this, he subjoins the following correction—that we\nourselves open our eyes to behold the light, but that the eyes of our\nminds remain shut, unless they are opened by the Lord. Nor does the\nScripture teach us that our minds are illuminated only on one day, so as\nto enable them to see afterwards without further assistance; for the\npassage just quoted from Paul(601) relates to continual advances and\nimprovements. And this is clearly expressed by David in these words: “With\nmy whole heart have I sought thee; O let me not wander from thy\ncommandments.” For after having been regenerated, and made a more than\ncommon progress in true piety, he still confesses his need of perpetual\ndirection every moment, lest he should decline from that knowledge which\nhe possessed. Therefore, in another place, he prays for the renewal of a\nright spirit, which he had lost by his sin;(602) because it belongs to the\nsame God to restore that which he originally bestowed, but of which we\nhave been for a time deprived.\nXXVI. We must now proceed to the examination of the will, to which\nprincipally belongs the liberty of choice; for we have before seen that\nelection belongs rather to the will than to the understanding. In the\nfirst place, that the opinion advanced by philosophers, and received by\ngeneral consent, that all things, by a natural instinct, desire what is\ngood, may not be supposed to prove the rectitude of the human will, let us\nobserve, that the power of free choice is not to be contemplated in that\nkind of appetite, which proceeds rather from the inclination of the nature\nthan from the deliberation of the mind. For even the schoolmen confess\nthat there is no action of free choice, but when reason sees and considers\nthe rival objects presented to it; meaning that the object of appetite\nmust be such as is the subject of choice, and that deliberation precedes\nand introduces choice. And in fact, if you examine the desire of good\nwhich is natural to man, you will find that he has it in common with the\nbrutes. For they also desire to be happy, and pursue every agreeable\nappearance which attracts their senses. But man neither rationally chooses\nas the object of his pursuit that which is truly good for him, according\nto the excellency of his immortal nature, nor takes the advice of reason,\nnor duly exerts his understanding; but without reason, without reflection,\nfollows his natural inclination, like the herds of the field. It is\ntherefore no argument for the liberty of the will, that man is led by\nnatural instinct to desire that which is good; but it is necessary that he\ndiscern what is good according to right reason; that as soon as he knows\nit, he choose it; and as soon as he has chosen it, he pursue it. To remove\nevery difficulty, we must advert to two instances of false argumentation.\nFor the desire here intended is not a proper motion of the will, but a\nnatural inclination; and the good in question relates not to virtue or\nrighteousness, but to condition; as when we say a man is well or in good\nhealth. Lastly, though man has the strongest desire after what is good,\nyet he does not pursue it. There is no man to whom eternal felicity is\nunwelcome, yet no man aspires to it without the influence of the Spirit.\nSince, therefore, the desire of happiness natural to man furnishes no\nargument for the liberty of the will, any more than a tendency in metals\nand stones towards the perfection of their nature argues liberty in them,\nlet us consider, in some other particulars, whether the will be in every\npart so entirely vitiated and depraved that it can produce nothing but\nwhat is evil; or whether it retain any small part uninjured which may be\nthe source of good desires.\nXXVII. Those who attribute it to the first grace of God, that we are able\nto will effectually, seem, on the contrary, to imply that the soul has a\nfaculty of spontaneously aspiring to what is good, but that it is too weak\nto rise into a solid affection, or to excite any endeavour. And there is\nno doubt that the schoolmen have in general embraced this opinion, which\nwas borrowed from Origen and some of the fathers, since they frequently\nconsider man in things purely natural, as they express themselves,\naccording to the description given by the Apostle in these words: “The\ngood that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. To\nwill is present with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find\nnot.”(603) But this is a miserable and complete perversion of the argument\nwhich Paul is pursuing in that passage. For he is treating of the\nChristian conflict, which he more briefly hints at to the Galatians; the\nconflict which the faithful perpetually experience within themselves in\nthe contention between the flesh and the spirit. Now, the spirit is not\nfrom nature, but from regeneration. But that the Apostle speaks concerning\nthe regenerate, is evident from his assertion, that in himself dwelt\nnothing good, being immediately followed by an explanation that he meant\nit of his flesh. And therefore he affirms that it is not he that does\nevil, but sin that dwells in him. What is the meaning of this correction,\n“in me, that is, in my flesh?” It is as if he had expressed himself in the\nfollowing manner: No good resides in me originating from myself, for in my\nflesh can be found nothing that is good. Hence follows that form of\nexculpation: “I do no evil, but sin that dwelleth in me;”(604) which is\ninapplicable to any but the regenerate, who, with the prevailing bias of\ntheir souls, aim at what is good. Now, the conclusion which is subjoined\nplaces all this in a clear point of view: “I delight,” says he, “in the\nlaw of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members,\nwarring against the law of my mind.”(605) Who has such a dissension in\nhimself, but he who, being regenerated by the Divine Spirit, carries about\nwith him the relics of his flesh? Therefore Augustine, though he had at\none time supposed that discourse to relate to the natural state of man,\nretracted his interpretation, as false and inconsistent. And, indeed, if\nwe allow that men destitute of grace have some motions towards true\ngoodness, though ever so feeble, what answer shall we give to the Apostle,\nwho denies that we are sufficient of ourselves to entertain even a good\nthought?(606) What reply shall we make to the Lord, who pronounces, by the\nmouth of Moses, that every imagination of the human heart is only\nevil?(607) Since they have stumbled on a false interpretation of one\npassage, therefore, there is no reason why we should dwell on their\nopinion. Rather let us receive this declaration of Christ, “Whosoever\ncommitteth sin is the servant of sin.”(608) We are all sinners by nature;\ntherefore we are all held under the yoke of sin. Now, if the whole man be\nsubject to the dominion of sin, the will, which is the principal seat of\nit, must necessarily be bound with the firmest bonds. Nor would there\notherwise be any consistency in the assertion of Paul, “that it is God\nthat worketh in us to will,”(609) if any will preceded the grace of the\nSpirit. Farewell, then, all the idle observations of many writers\nconcerning preparation; for although the faithful sometimes petition that\ntheir hearts may be conformed to the Divine law, as David does in many\nplaces,(610) yet it should be remarked that even this desire of praying\noriginates from God. This we may gather from the language of David; for\nwhen he wishes a clean heart to be created within him,(611) he certainly\ndoes not arrogate to himself the beginning of such a creation. Let us\nrather, therefore, attend to this advice of Augustine: “God will prevent\nyou in all things: do you also sometimes prevent his wrath.” How? “Confess\nthat you have all those things from God; that whatever good you have, it\nis from him; but whatever evil, from yourself.” And a little after,\n“Nothing is ours, but sin.”"

          "title": "Chapter III. Every Thing That Proceeds From The Corrupt Nature Of Man",
          "content": "Worthy Of Condemnation.\nBut man cannot be better known in either faculty of his soul, than when he\nis represented in those characters by which the Scripture has\ndistinguished him. If he be completely described in these words of Christ,\n“That which is born of the flesh is flesh,”(612) as it is easy to prove,\nit is evident that he is a very miserable creature. For, according to the\ntestimony of the Apostle, “to be carnally minded is death, because the\ncarnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of\nGod, neither indeed can be.”(613) Is the flesh so perverse, that, with all\nits affections, it entertains a secret hatred against God? that it cannot\nconsent to the righteousness of the Divine law? in a word, that it can\nproduce nothing but what tends to death? Now, grant, that in the nature of\nman there is nothing but flesh, and elicit any good from it, if you can.\nBut the name of flesh, it will be said, pertains only to the sensual, and\nnot to the superior faculties of the soul. This is abundantly refuted by\nthe words of Christ and of the Apostle. For the argument of our Lord is,\nthat man must be born again, because he is flesh. He does not teach a new\nbirth in regard to the body. Now, a new birth of the soul requires not a\ncorrection of some portion of it, but an entire renovation. And this is\nconfirmed by the antithesis in both places; for there is such a comparison\nbetween the flesh and the spirit, that there is no medium left. Therefore,\nevery thing in man that is not spiritual, is, according to this mode of\nreasoning, denominated carnal. But we have nothing of the spirit, except\nby regeneration. Whatever, therefore, we have from nature is carnal. But\nif on that point there could otherwise be any doubt, we have it removed by\nPaul, when, after a description of the old man, which he had asserted to\nbe “corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,”(614) he directs us to “be\nrenewed in the spirit of our mind.” You see that he places unlawful and\ncorrupt affections not only in the sensitive part, but also in the mind\nitself, and, therefore, requires a renovation of it. And, indeed, he had\njust before drawn such a picture of human nature, as showed us to be in\nevery part corrupted and depraved. For his description of all the\nGentiles, as “walking in the vanity of their mind, having the\nunderstanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the\nignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart,”(615)\nis undoubtedly applicable to all those whom the Lord has not yet renewed\nto the rectitude of his wisdom and righteousness. This is still more\nevident from the comparison soon after introduced, where he reminds the\nfaithful, that they “have not so learned Christ.” For from these words we\nconclude, that the grace of Christ is the only remedy, by which we can be\nliberated from that blindness, and from the evils consequent upon it. And\nthis is what Isaiah had prophesied concerning the kingdom of Christ, when\nhe predicted that the Lord would be “an everlasting light” to his Church,\nwhilst at the same time “darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness\nthe people.”(616) When he declares, that the light of God will only arise\nupon the Church, beyond the limits of the Church he certainly leaves\nnothing but darkness and blindness. I will not particularly recite all the\npassages which are to be found, especially in the Psalms and in the\nProphets, concerning the vanity of man. It is a striking observation of\nDavid, that “to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than\nvanity.”(617) It is a severe condemnation of his understanding, when all\nthe thoughts which proceed from it are derided as foolish, frivolous, mad,\nand perverse.\nII. Equally severe is the condemnation of the heart, when it is called\n“deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.”(618) But as I study\nbrevity, I shall be content with citing a single passage, which, however,\nwill resemble a very lucid mirror, in which we may behold at full length\nthe image of our nature. For the Apostle, when he wishes to demolish the\narrogance of mankind, does it by these testimonies: “There is none\nrighteous, no, not one; there is none that understandeth, there is none\nthat seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are\ntogether become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.\nTheir throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used\ndeceit; the poison of asps is under their lips; whose mouth is full of\ncursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood; destruction\nand misery are in their ways; there is no fear of God before their\neyes.”(619) In this terrible manner he inveighs, not against particular\nindividuals, but against all the posterity of Adam. He does not declaim\nagainst the depraved manners of one or another age, but accuses the\nperpetual corruption of our nature. For his design in that passage is not\nsimply to rebuke men, in order that they may repent, but rather to teach\nus that all men are overwhelmed with an inevitable calamity, from which\nthey can never emerge unless they are extricated by the mercy of God. As\nthis could not be proved unless it were evinced by the ruin and\ndestruction of our nature, he has adduced these testimonies, which\ndemonstrate our nature to be totally ruined. Let this, then, be admitted,\nthat men are such as they are here described, not only by corrupt habits,\nbut also by a depravity of nature; for otherwise the reasoning of the\nApostle could not be supported, “that there is no salvation for man but\nfrom the mercy of God; since in himself he is in a ruined and desperate\ncondition.” Here I shall not attempt to establish the application of the\ntestimonies, to preclude the appearance of their being improperly\nintroduced. I shall treat them just as if they had been originally uttered\nby Paul, and not quoted from the Prophets. He divests man first of\nrighteousness, that is, integrity and purity, and then of understanding.\nDefect of understanding is proved by apostasy from God, the seeking of\nwhom is the first step in the path of wisdom; but this loss must\nnecessarily befall those who have revolted from God. He adds, that all\nhave gone out of the way, and are become altogether corrupt, that there is\nnot one that does good. Then he subjoins the flagitious crimes, with which\nthey, who are once abandoned to iniquity, contaminate all the members of\ntheir bodies. Lastly, he declares them to be destitute of the fear of God,\nthe rule by which all our steps ought to be directed. If these are the\nhereditary characters of mankind, in vain do we seek in our nature for any\nthing that is good. I grant, indeed, that all these crimes are not\nexhibited in every individual; yet it cannot be denied that this monster\nlurks in the hearts of all. For as the body, which already contains within\nitself the cause and matter of a disease, although it has yet no sensation\nof pain, cannot be said to enjoy good health, neither can the soul be\nesteemed healthy, while it is full of such moral maladies; although this\nsimilitude will not correspond in every particular; for in the body,\nhowever diseased, there remains the vigour of life; but the soul, immersed\nin this gulf of iniquity, is not only the subject of vices, but totally\ndestitute of every thing that is good.\nIII. A question, nearly the same as we have already answered, here\npresents itself to us again. For in all ages there have been some persons,\nwho, from the mere dictates of nature, have devoted their whole lives to\nthe pursuit of virtue. And though many errors might perhaps be discovered\nin their conduct, yet by their pursuit of virtue they afforded a proof,\nthat there was some degree of purity in their nature. The value attached\nto virtues of such a description before God, we shall more fully discuss\nwhen we come to treat of the merits of works; yet it must be stated also\nin this place, so far as is necessary for the elucidation of the present\nsubject. These examples, then, seem to teach us that we should not\nconsider human nature to be totally corrupted; since, from its instinctive\nbias, some men have not only been eminent for noble actions, but have\nuniformly conducted themselves in a most virtuous manner through the whole\ncourse of their lives. But here we ought to remember, that amidst this\ncorruption of nature there is some room for Divine grace, not to purify\nit, but internally to restrain its operations. For should the Lord permit\nthe minds of all men to give up the reins to every lawless passion, there\ncertainly would not be an individual in the world, whose actions would not\nevince all the crimes, for which Paul condemns human nature in general, to\nbe most truly applicable to him. For can you except yourself from the\nnumber of those whose feet are swift to shed blood, whose hands are\npolluted with rapine and murder, whose throats are like open sepulchres,\nwhose tongues are deceitful, whose lips are envenomed, whose works are\nuseless, iniquitous, corrupt, and deadly, whose souls are estranged from\nGod, the inmost recesses of whose hearts are full of pravity, whose eyes\nare insidiously employed, whose minds are elated with insolence—in a word,\nall whose powers are prepared for the commission of atrocious and\ninnumerable crimes? If every soul be subject to all these monstrous vices,\nas the Apostle fearlessly pronounces, we clearly see what would be the\nconsequence, if the Lord should suffer the human passions to go all the\nlengths to which they are inclined. There is no furious beast, that would\nbe agitated with such ungovernable rage; there is no river, though ever so\nrapid and violent, that would overflow its boundaries with such\nimpetuosity. In his elect, the Lord heals these maladies by a method which\nwe shall hereafter describe. In others, he restrains them, only to prevent\ntheir ebullitions so far as he sees to be necessary for the preservation\nof the universe. Hence some by shame, and some by fear of the laws, are\nprevented from running into many kinds of pollutions, though they cannot\nin any great degree dissemble their impurity; others, because they think\nthat a virtuous course of life is advantageous, entertain some languid\ndesires after it; others go further, and display more than common\nexcellence, that by their majesty they may confine the vulgar to their\nduty. Thus God by his providence restrains the perverseness of our nature\nfrom breaking out into external acts, but does not purify it within.\nIV. But it may be said, the difficulty is not yet removed. For either we\nmust esteem Camillus to be exactly similar to Catiline, or in Camillus we\nshall have an example that nature, if it be studiously cultivated, is not\naltogether destitute of goodness. I grant, indeed, that the virtues\ndisplayed in Camillus were gifts of God, and if considered in themselves,\nappear justly worthy of commendation: but how will they be proofs of any\nnatural goodness in him? To establish this, must we not recur to the\nheart, and argue, that if a natural man was eminent for such integrity of\nmanners, human nature is not destitute of ability for the pursuit of\nvirtue? But what if his heart was depraved and perverted, and followed any\nthing rather than the path of rectitude? And that it was such, if you\nconcede that he was a natural man, is beyond all doubt. What ability,\nthen, will you attribute to human nature for the pursuit of virtue, if,\nwith the greatest appearance of integrity, it is discovered to be always\ntending to corruption? Therefore, as you will not commend a man for\nvirtue, whose vices have only counterfeited the external form of virtue,\nso you must not attribute to the human will a power of desiring what is\nright, as long as it continues fixed in its perverseness. The most certain\nand easy solution of this question, however, is, that those virtues are\nnot the common properties of nature, but the peculiar graces of God, which\nhe dispenses in great variety, and in a certain degree to men that are\notherwise profane. For which reason we hesitate not, in common speech, to\ncall the nature of one man good, and of another depraved. Yet we still\ninclude both in the universal state of human depravity; but we signify\nwhat peculiar grace God has conferred on the one, with which he has not\ndeigned to favour the other. When he determined to exalt Saul to the\nkingdom, he made him, as it were, a new man; and this is the reason why\nPlato, alluding to the fable of Homer, says, that the sons of kings are\nformed with some distinguishing singularity of character; because God,\nconsulting the benefit of mankind, frequently furnishes with an heroic\nnature those whom he destines to hold the reins of empire; and from this\nsource have proceeded all the exploits of great heroes which are\ncelebrated in history. The same judgment must be formed concerning those\nalso who are in a private station. But because every one who has risen to\ngreat eminence has been impelled by his ambition, which defiles all\nvirtues, and deprives them of all excellence in the Divine view, whatever\nmay be apparently laudable in ungodly men, ought not to be esteemed at all\nmeritorious. Besides, the chief branch of rectitude is wanting, where\nthere is no concern to display the glory of God: of this principle all are\ndestitute whom he has not regenerated by his Spirit. Nor is it in vain\nthat Isaiah says, that “the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall rest\nupon” Christ;(620) which teaches us, that all who are alienated from\nChrist are destitute of that “fear of the Lord” which is “the beginning of\nwisdom.”(621) The virtues which deceive us by their vain and specious\nappearance, will be applauded in civil courts, and in the common\nestimation of mankind; but before the celestial tribunal they will possess\nno value to merit the reward of righteousness.\nV. The will, therefore, is so bound by the slavery of sin, that it cannot\nexcite itself, much less devote itself to any thing good; for such a\ndisposition is the beginning of a conversion to God, which in the\nScriptures is attributed solely to Divine grace. Thus Jeremiah prays to\nthe Lord to convert or turn him, if he would have him to be turned.(622)\nWhence the Prophet, in the same chapter, describing the spiritual\nredemption of the faithful, says, “The Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and\nransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he;”(623)\nalluding to the strong fetters with which the sinner is bound as long as\nhe is deserted by the Lord, and continues under the yoke of the devil.\nNevertheless there still remains the faculty of will, which with the\nstrongest propensity is inclined to and rushes into sin; for when man\nsubjected himself to this necessity, he was not deprived of his will, but\nof soundness of will. Bernard properly observes, that we all have a power\nto will; but that to will what is good, is an advantage; to will what is\nevil, a defect. Therefore simply to will belongs to man; to will what is\nevil, to corrupt nature; to will what is good, to grace. Now, when I\nassert that the will, being deprived of its liberty, is necessarily drawn\nor led into evil, I should wonder, if any one considered it as a harsh\nexpression, since it has nothing in it absurd, nor is it unsanctioned by\nthe custom of good men. It offends those who know not how to distinguish\nbetween necessity and compulsion. But if any one should ask them, whether\nGod is not necessarily good, and whether the devil is not necessarily\nevil,—what answer will they make? For there is such a close connection\nbetween the goodness of God and his Deity, that his being God is not more\nnecessary than his being good. But the devil is by his fall so alienated\nfrom communion with all that is good, that he can do nothing but what is\nevil. But if any one should sacrilegiously object, that little praise is\ndue to God for his goodness, which he is constrained to preserve,—shall we\nnot readily reply, that his inability to do evil arises from his infinite\ngoodness, and not from the impulse of violence? Therefore, if a necessity\nof doing well impairs not the liberty of the Divine will in doing well; if\nthe devil, who cannot but do evil, nevertheless sins voluntarily; who then\nwill assert that man sins less voluntarily, because he is under a\nnecessity of sinning? This necessity Augustine every where maintains; and\neven when he was pressed with the cavils of Celestius, who tried to throw\nan odium on this doctrine, he confidently expressed himself in these\nterms: “By means of liberty it came to pass that man fell into sin; but\nnow the penal depravity consequent on it, instead of liberty, has\nintroduced necessity.” And whenever the mention of this subject occurs, he\nhesitates not to speak in this manner of the necessary servitude of sin.\nWe must therefore observe this grand point of distinction, that man,\nhaving been corrupted by his fall, sins voluntarily, not with reluctance\nor constraint; with the strongest propensity of disposition, not with\nviolent coercion; with the bias of his own passions, and not with external\ncompulsion: yet such is the pravity of his nature, that he cannot be\nexcited and biassed to any thing but what is evil. If this be true, there\nis no impropriety in affirming, that he is under a necessity of sinning.\nBernard, subscribing to what is said by Augustine, thus expresses himself:\n“Among all the animals, man alone is free; and yet, by the intervention of\nsin, he also suffers a species of violence; but from the will, not from\nnature, so that he is not thereby deprived of his innate liberty.” For\nwhat is voluntary is also free. And a little after: “The will being, by I\nknow not what corrupt and surprising means, changed for the worse, is\nitself the author of the necessity to which it is subject; so that neither\nnecessity, being voluntary, can excuse the will, nor the will, being\nfascinated, can exclude necessity.” For this necessity is in some measure\nvoluntary. Afterwards he says, that we are oppressed with a yoke, but no\nother than that of a voluntary servitude; that therefore our servitude\nrenders us miserable, and our will renders us inexcusable; because the\nwill, when it was free, made itself the slave of sin. At length he\nconcludes, “Thus the soul, in a certain strange and evil manner, under\nthis kind of voluntary and free yet pernicious necessity, is both enslaved\nand free; enslaved by necessity, free by its will; and, what is more\nwonderful and more miserable, it is guilty, because free; and enslaved\nwherein it is guilty; and so therein enslaved wherein it is free.” From\nthese passages the reader clearly perceives that I am teaching no novel\ndoctrine, but what was long ago advanced by Augustine, with the universal\nconsent of pious men, and which for nearly a thousand years after was\nconfined to the cloisters of monks. But Lombard, for want of knowing how\nto distinguish necessity from coaction, gave rise to a pernicious error.\nVI. It is necessary, on the other hand, to consider the remedy of Divine\ngrace, by which the depravity of nature is corrected and healed. For since\nthe Lord, in the assistance which he affords us, bestows on us that which\nwe need, an exhibition of the nature of his work in us will immediately\ndiscover the nature of our necessity. When the Apostle tells the\nPhilippians, that he is “confident that he which hath begun a good work in\nthem will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ;”(624) by the beginning\nof a good work he undoubtedly designs the commencement of conversion,\nwhich takes place in the will. Therefore God begins the good work in us by\nexciting in our hearts a love, desire, and ardent pursuit of\nrighteousness; or, to speak more properly, by bending, forming, and\ndirecting our hearts towards righteousness; but he completes it, by\nconfirming us to perseverance. That no one may cavil, that the good work\nis begun by the Lord, inasmuch as the will, which is weak of itself, is\nassisted by him, the Spirit declares in another place how far the ability\nof the will reaches, when left to itself. “A new heart also,” says he,\n“will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take\naway the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of\nflesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my\nstatutes.”(625) Who will assert that the infirmity of the human will is\nonly strengthened by assistance, to enable it efficaciously to aspire to\nthe choice of that which is good, when it actually needs a total\ntransformation and renovation? If there be in a stone any softness, which,\nby some application, being made more tender, would be flexible in every\ndirection, then I will not deny the flexibility of the human heart to the\nobedience of rectitude, provided its imperfections are supplied by the\ngrace of God. But if, by this similitude, the Lord intended to show that\nno good will ever be extracted from our hearts, unless they are entirely\nrenewed, let us not divide between him and us, what he claims exclusively\nto himself. If, therefore, when God converts us to the pursuit of\nrectitude, this change is like the transformation of a stone into flesh,\nit follows, that whatever belongs to our own will is removed, and what\nsucceeds to it is entirely from God. The will, I say, is removed, not\nconsidered as the will; because, in the conversion of man, the properties\nof our original nature remain entire. I assert also, that it is created\nanew, not that the will then begins to exist, but that it is then\nconverted from an evil into a good one. This I affirm to be done entirely\nby God, because, according to the testimony of the same Apostle, “we are\nnot sufficient” even “to think.”(626) Therefore he elsewhere declares, not\nmerely that God assists the infirmity of our will, or corrects its\ndepravity, but that he “worketh in us to will.”(627) Whence it is easy to\ninfer what I have already remarked, that whatever good is in the human\nwill, is the work of pure grace. In the same sense he elsewhere pronounces\nthat it is “God which worketh all in all.”(628) For in that place he is\nnot discussing the government of the universe, but asserting that the\npraise of all the excellences found in the faithful belongs to God alone.\nAnd by using the word “all,” he certainly makes God the author of\nspiritual life from its commencement even to its termination. This is the\nsame as he had before taught in other words, declaring that the faithful\nare “of God in Christ;”(629) where he evidently intends the new creation,\nby which what belonged to our common nature is abolished. For we must here\nunderstand an implied contrast between Adam and Christ, which he states\nmore plainly in another place, where he teaches that “we are the\nworkmanship of God, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God\nhath before ordained that we should walk in them.”(630) For by this\nargument he designs to prove that our salvation is gratuitous, because the\nbeginning of all good is from the second creation, which we obtain in\nChrist. Now, if we possessed any ability, though ever so small, we should\nalso have some portion of merit. But to annihilate all our pretensions, he\nargues that we have merited nothing, because “we are created in Christ\nJesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained;” in which\nexpressions he again signifies that all the parts of good works, even from\nthe first inclination of the mind, are entirely from God. For this reason\nthe Psalmist, after having said that “he (God) hath made us,” that there\nmay be no division of the work, immediately subjoins, “and not we\nourselves.”(631) That he speaks of regeneration, which is the commencement\nof the spiritual life, is evident from the context, where it follows\nimmediately after, that “we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.”\nWe see, then, that not content with having simply attributed to God the\npraise of our salvation, he expressly excludes us from all fellowship with\nhim; as though he would say, that man has not even the smallest particle\nremaining in which he can glory, because all is of God.\nVII. But there may be some, who will concede that the will, being, of its\nown spontaneous inclination, averse to what is good, is converted solely\nby the power of the Lord; yet in such a manner, that being previously\nprepared, it has also its own share in the work; that grace, as Augustine\nteaches, precedes every good work, the will following grace, not leading\nit, being its companion, not its guide. This unobjectionable observation\nof that holy man, Peter Lombard preposterously wrests to an erroneous\nmeaning. Now, I contend that both in the words of the Prophet which I have\ncited, and in other passages, these two things are clearly signified, that\nthe Lord corrects our depraved will, or rather removes it, and of himself\nintroduces a good one in its place. As it is preceded by grace, I allow\nyou to style it an attendant; but since its reformation is the work of the\nLord, it is wrong to attribute to man a voluntary obedience in following\nthe guidance of grace. Therefore it is not a proper expression of\nChrysostom, that grace is able to effect nothing without the will, nor the\nwill without grace; as if grace did not produce the will itself, as we\nhave just seen from Paul. Nor was it the intention of Augustine, when he\ncalled the human will the companion of grace, to assign to it any\nsecondary office next to grace in the good work; but with a view to refute\nthe nefarious dogma broached by Pelagius, who made the prime cause of\nsalvation to consist in human merit, he contends, what was sufficient for\nhis present argument, that grace is prior to all merit; omitting, at this\ntime, the other question concerning the perpetual efficiency of grace,\nwhich is admirably treated by him on other occasions. For when he\nfrequently says, that the Lord precedes the unwilling that he may will,\nand follows the willing that he may not will in vain, he makes him the\nsole author of the good work. His language on this subject is too explicit\nto require much argument. “Men labour,” says he, “to discover in our will\nsomething that is our own, and not derived from God; and how any such\ndiscovery can be made, I know not.” In his first book against Pelagius and\nCelestius, where he explains that declaration of Christ, “Every man that\nhath heard of the Father cometh unto me,”(632) he says, that “the will is\nassisted so as to enable it not only to know its duty, but what it knows,\nalso to do.” And thus when God teaches not by the letter of the law, but\nby the grace of the Spirit, he teaches in such a manner, that whatever\neach one has learned, he not only sees in knowing it, but desires in\nwilling, and performs in doing.\nVIII. And as we are now engaged on the principal point of the argument,\nlet us give the reader a summary of the doctrine, and prove it by a few\nvery clear testimonies of Scripture; and then, that no one may accuse us\nof perverting the Scripture, let us also show that the truth which we\nassert to be deduced from the Scripture is not destitute of the support of\nthis holy man; I mean Augustine. For I conceive it is unnecessary to\nrecite in regular order all the passages which might be adduced from the\nScriptures in confirmation of our opinion; provided that the selection,\nwhich shall be made, prepares a way to the understanding of all the rest,\nwhich are frequently to be found. Nor do I think that there will be any\nimpropriety in evincing my agreement with that man, to whose authority the\nconsent of the pious pays a great and merited deference. The origin of all\ngood clearly appears, from a plain and certain reason, to be from no other\nthan from God alone; for no propensity of the will to any thing good can\nbe found but in the elect. But the cause of election must not be sought in\nmen. Whence we may conclude, that man has not a good will from himself,\nbut that it proceeds from the same decree by which we were elected before\nthe creation of the world. There is also another reason, not dissimilar.\nFor since good volitions and good actions both arise from faith, we must\nsee whence faith itself originates. Now, since the Scripture uniformly\nproclaims it to be the gratuitous gift of God, it follows that it is the\neffect of mere grace, when we, who are naturally and completely prone to\nevil, begin to will any thing that is good. Therefore the Lord, when he\nmentions these two things in the conversion of his people, that he takes\naway from them their stony heart, and gives them a heart of flesh, plainly\ndeclares, that what originates from ourselves must be removed, that we may\nbe converted to righteousness; and that whatever succeeds in its place\nproceeds from himself. Nor is it only in one passage that he announces\nthis; for he says in Jeremiah, “I will give them one heart and one way,\nthat they may fear me for ever.”(633) And a little after, “I will put my\nfear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.” Again in\nEzekiel, “I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit within\nyou; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give\nthem a heart of flesh.”(634) He could not more evidently claim to himself\nand take from us all that is good and upright in our will, than when he\ndeclares our conversion to be the creation of a new spirit and of a new\nheart. For it always follows, that nothing good proceeds from our will\ntill it be renovated; and that after its renovation, as far as it is good,\nit is from God, and not from ourselves.\nIX. And we find the saints have made this the subject of their prayers.\nSolomon prayed, “May the Lord incline our hearts unto him to keep his\ncommandments.”(635) He shows the stubbornness of our heart, which, unless\na new bias be given to it, naturally indulges itself in rebellion against\nthe Divine law. The same petition is offered by the Psalmist: “Incline my\nheart unto thy testimonies.”(636) For we should always remark the\nopposition between the perverse bias of the heart, which inclines it to\nrebellion, and this correction, which constrains it to obedience. But when\nDavid, perceiving himself to be for a time deprived of the direction of\ngrace, prays that God would “create in” him “a clean heart, and renew a\nright spirit within” him,(637) does he not acknowledge that all the parts\nof his heart are full of impurity, and his spirit warped by a depraved\nobliquity? and by calling the purity which he earnestly implores, the\ncreation of God, does he not ascribe it entirely to him? If any one\nobject, that the petition itself is a proof of a pious and holy affection,\nthe answer is easy, that although David had already partly repented, yet\nhe compares his former state with that melancholy fall, which he had\nexperienced. Assuming the character, therefore, of a man alienated from\nGod, he properly requests for himself all those things which God confers\non his elect in regeneration. Resembling a dead man, therefore, he prays\nto be created anew, that, instead of being the slave of Satan, he may\nbecome the instrument of the Holy Spirit. Truly wonderful and monstrous is\nthe extravagance of our pride. God requires of us nothing more severe than\nthat we most religiously observe his sabbath, by resting from our own\nworks; but there is nothing which we find more difficult, or to which we\nare more reluctant, than to bid farewell to our own works, in order to\ngive the works of God their proper place. If there were no obstacle\narising from our folly, Christ has given a testimony to his graces,\nsufficiently clear to prevent them from being wickedly suppressed. “I am\nthe vine,” says he, “ye are the branches. My Father is the husbandman. As\nthe branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no\nmore can ye, except ye abide in me. For without me ye can do\nnothing.”(638) If we cannot bear fruit of ourselves, any more than a\nbranch can bud after it is torn up from the ground, and deprived of\nmoisture, we must no longer seek for any aptitude in our nature to that\nwhich is good. There is no ambiguity in this conclusion, “Without me ye\ncan do nothing.” He does not say that we are too weak to be sufficient for\nourselves, but reducing us to nothing, excludes every idea of ability,\nhowever diminutive. If, being engrafted into Christ, we bear fruit like a\nvine, which derives the energy of vegetation from the moisture of the\nearth, from the dew of heaven, and from the benign influences of the sun,\nI see nothing of our own remaining in any good work, if we preserve entire\nto God the honour which belongs to him. It is in vain to urge that\nfrivolous subtlety, that the branch already possesses sap, and a\nfructifying power, and that therefore it does not derive all from the\nearth, or from the original root, because it contributes something of its\nown. For the meaning of Christ is clearly that we are as a dry and\nworthless log, when separated from him; because, independently of him, we\nhave no ability to do good, as he says also in another place: “Every\nplant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.”(639)\nWherefore the Apostle ascribes all the praise to him in the place already\ncited. “It is God,” says he, “which worketh in you both to will and to\ndo.”(640) The first part of a good work is volition, the next an effectual\nendeavour to perform it; God is the author of both. Therefore we rob the\nLord, if we arrogate any thing to ourselves either in volition or in\nexecution. If God were said to assist the infirmity of our will, then\nthere would be something left to us; but since he is said to produce the\nwill, all the good that is in it, is placed without us. And because the\ngood will is still oppressed by the burden of our flesh, so that it cannot\nextricate itself, he has added, that in struggling with the difficulties\nof that conflict, we are supplied with constancy of exertion to carry our\nvolitions into effect. For otherwise there would be no truth in what he\nelsewhere teaches, that “it is the same God which worketh all in\nall,”(641) which we have before shown comprehends the whole course of the\nspiritual life. For which reason David, after having prayed that the way\nof God may be discovered to him, that he may walk in his truth,\nimmediately adds, “Unite my heart to fear thy name.”(642) In these words\nhe intimates, that even good men are subject to so many distractions of\nmind, that they soon wander and fall, unless they are strengthened to\npersevere. For the same reason, in another passage, having prayed that his\nsteps might be ordered in the word of the Lord, he likewise implores\nstrength for a warfare: “Let not any iniquity have dominion over me.”(643)\nIn this manner, therefore, the Lord both begins and completes the good\nwork in us; that it may be owing to him, that the will conceives a love\nfor what is right, that it is inclined to desire it, and is excited and\nimpelled to endeavour to attain it; and then that the choice, desire, and\nendeavour do not fail, but proceed even to the completion of the desired\neffect; lastly, that a man proceeds with constancy in them, and perseveres\neven to the end.\nX. And he moves the will, not according to the system maintained and\nbelieved for many ages, in such a manner that it would afterwards be at\nour option either to obey the impulse or to resist it, but by an\nefficacious influence. The observation, therefore, so frequently repeated\nby Chrysostom, that “Whom God draws, he draws willing,” we are obliged to\nreject, being an insinuation that God only waits for us with his hand\nextended, if we choose to accept his assistance. We grant that such was\nthe primitive condition of man during his state of integrity, that he\ncould incline to the one side or the other; but since Adam has taught us\nby his own example how miserable free will is, unless God give us both\nwill and power, what will become of us if he impart his grace to us in\nthat small proportion? Nay, we obscure and diminish his grace by our\ningratitude. For the Apostle does not teach that the grace of a good will\nis offered to us for our acceptance, but that he “worketh in us to will;”\nwhich is equivalent to saying, that the Lord, by his Spirit, directs,\ninclines, and governs our heart, and reigns in it as in his own\npossession. Nor does he promise by Ezekiel that he will give to the elect\na new spirit, only that they may be able to walk, but that they may\nactually walk, in his precepts.(644) Nor can the declaration of Christ,\n“Every man that hath heard of the Father cometh unto me,”(645) be\nunderstood in any other sense than as a proof of the positive efficacy of\nDivine grace; as Augustine also contends. This grace the Lord deigns not\nto give to any person promiscuously, according to the observation commonly\nattributed, if I mistake not, to Occam, that it is denied to no man who\ndoes what he can. Men are to be taught, indeed, that the Divine benignity\nis free to all who seek it, without any exception; but since none begin to\nseek it, but those who have been inspired by heavenly grace, not even this\ndiminutive portion ought to be taken from his praise. This is the\nprivilege of the elect, that, being regenerated by the Spirit of God, they\nare led and governed by his direction. Wherefore Augustine as justly\nridicules those who arrogate to themselves any part of a good volition, as\nhe reprehends others, who suppose that to be given promiscuously to all,\nwhich is the special evidence of gratuitous election. “Nature,” says he,\n“is common to all men, but not grace.” He calls it “a transparent\nsubtlety, which shines merely with vanity, when that is extended generally\nto all, which God confers on whom he chooses.” But elsewhere, “How have\nyou come? by believing. Be afraid, lest while you arrogate to yourself the\ndiscovery of the way of righteousness, you perish from the way of\nrighteousness. I am come, you say, by free will; I am come through my own\nchoice. Why are you inflated with pride? Will you know that this also is\ngiven to you? Hear him proclaiming, ‘No man can come to me, except the\nFather which hath sent me draw him.’ ”(646) And it incontrovertibly\nfollows, from the words of John, that the hearts of the pious are divinely\ngoverned with such effect, that they follow with an affection which\nnothing can alter. “Whosoever is born of God,” he says, “cannot sin; for\nhis seed remaineth in him.”(647) For we see that the neutral,\ninefficacious impulse imagined by the sophists, which every one would be\nat liberty to obey or resist, is evidently excluded, where it is asserted\nthat God gives a constancy that is effectual to perseverance.\nXI. Concerning perseverance there would have been no doubt that it ought\nto be esteemed the gratuitous gift of God, had it not been for the\nprevalence of a pestilent error, that it is dispensed according to the\nmerit of men, in proportion to the gratitude which each person has\ndiscovered for the grace bestowed on him. But as that opinion arose from\nthe supposition that it was at our own option to reject or accept the\noffered grace of God, this notion being exploded, the other falls of\ncourse. Though here is a double error; for beside teaching that our\ngratitude for the grace first bestowed on us, and our legitimate use of\nthat grace, are remunerated by subsequent blessings, they add also, that\nnow grace does not operate alone in us, but only coöperates with us. On\nthe first point, we must admit that the Lord, while he daily enriches and\nloads his servants with new communications of his grace, perceiving the\nwork which he has begun in them grateful and acceptable, discovers\nsomething in them which he blesses with still greater degrees of grace.\nAnd this is implied in the following declarations: “Unto every one that\nhath, shall be given.” And, “Well done, good and faithful servant; thou\nhast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many\nthings.”(648) But here two errors must be avoided; the legitimate use of\nthe grace first bestowed must not be said to be rewarded with subsequent\ndegrees of grace, as though man, by his own industry, rendered the grace\nof God efficacious; nor must it be accounted a remuneration in such a\nsense as to cease to be esteemed the free favour of God. I grant, then,\nthat this Divine benediction is to be expected by the faithful, that the\nbetter they have used the former measures of grace, they shall afterwards\nbe enriched with proportionably greater degrees of it. But I assert that\nthis use also is from the Lord, and that this remuneration proceeds from\nhis gratuitous benevolence. They are equally awkward and unhappy in their\nuse of the trite distinction of operating and coöperating grace. Augustine\nhas used it indeed, but softens it by a suitable definition; that God in\ncoöperating completes what in operating he begins, and that it is the same\ngrace, but derives its name from the different mode of its efficiency.\nWhence it follows, that he makes no partition of the work between God and\nus, as though there were a mutual concurrence from the respective\nexertions of each; but that he only designates the multiplication of\ngrace. To the same purpose is what he elsewhere asserts, that the good\nwill of man precedes many of the gifts of God, but is itself one of their\nnumber. Whence it follows, that he leaves nothing for it to arrogate to\nitself. This is also particularly expressed by Paul. For having said that\n“it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do,”(649) he\nimmediately adds, that he does both “of his own good pleasure,” signifying\nby this expression that these are acts of gratuitous benignity. Now, to\ntheir wonted assertion, that after we have admitted the first grace, our\nown endeavours coöperate with the grace which follows, I reply, if they\nmean that, after having been once subdued by the Divine power to the\nobedience of righteousness, we voluntarily advance, and are disposed to\nfollow the guidance of grace, I make no objection. For it is very certain,\nthat where the grace of God reigns, there is such a promptitude of\nobedience. But whence does this arise but from the Spirit of God, who,\nuniformly consistent with himself, cherishes and strengthens to a\nconstancy of perseverance that disposition of obedience which he first\noriginated? But if they mean that man derives from himself an ability to\ncoöperate with the grace of God, they are involved in a most pestilent\nerror.\nXII. And to this purpose they falsely and ignorantly pervert that\nobservation of the Apostle, “I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet\nnot I, but the grace of God which was with me.”(650) For they understand\nit in this manner; that because his preference of himself to all others\nmight appear rather too arrogant, he corrects it by referring the praise\nto the grace of God; but yet so as to denominate himself a coöperator with\ngrace. It is surprising that so many men, not otherwise erroneous, have\nstumbled at this imaginary difficulty. For the Apostle does not say that\nthe grace of God laboured with him, to make himself a partner in the\nlabour; but rather by that correction ascribes the whole praise of the\nlabour to grace alone. “It is not I,” says he, “that have laboured, but\nthe grace of God which was with me.” They have been deceived by an\nambiguity of expression; but still more by a preposterous translation, in\nwhich the force of the Greek article is omitted. For if you translate it\nliterally, he says, not that grace was coöperative with him, but that the\ngrace which was with him was the author of all. And the same is maintained\nby Augustine, though briefly, yet without obscurity, when he thus\nexpresses himself: “The good will of man precedes many of the gifts of\nGod, but not all. But of those which it precedes it is itself one.” Then\nfollows this reason; because it is written, “The God of my mercy shall\nprevent me.”(651) And, “Mercy shall follow me.”(652) It prevents the\nunwilling, that he may will; it follows the willing, that he may not will\nin vain. With this agrees Bernard, who introduces the Church, saying,\n“Draw me unwilling, to make me willing; draw me inactive, to make me run.”\nXIII. Now, let us hear Augustine speak in his own words, lest the sophists\nof the Sorbonne, those Pelagians of the present age, according to their\nusual custom, accuse us of opposing the whole current of antiquity. In\nthis they imitate their father Pelagius, by whom Augustine was formerly\nobliged to enter into the same field of controversy. In his treatise _De\nCorr. et Grat._, addressed to Valentine, he treats very much at large what\nI shall recite briefly, but in his own words: “That to Adam was given the\ngrace of persevering in good if he chose; that grace is given to us to\nwill, and by willing to overcome concupiscence. That Adam therefore had\nthe power if he had the will, but not the will that he might have the\npower; but that it is given to us to have both the will and the power.\nThat the primitive liberty was a power to abstain from sin, but that ours\nis much greater, being an inability to commit sin.” And lest he should be\nsupposed to speak of the perfection to be enjoyed after the attainment of\na state of immortality, as Lombard misinterprets his meaning, he presently\nremoves this difficulty. For he says, “the will of the saints is so\ninflamed by the Holy Spirit, that they therefore have an ability, because\nthey have such a will; and that their having such a will proceeds from the\noperations of God.” For if, amidst such great weakness, which still\nrequires “strength” to be “made perfect”(653) for the repressing of pride,\nthey were left to their own will, so as to have ability, through the\nDivine assistance, if they were willing, and God did not operate in them\nto produce that will; among so many temptations and infirmities their will\nwould fail, and therefore they could not possibly persevere. The infirmity\nof the human will, then, is succoured, that it may be invariably and\ninseparably actuated by Divine grace, and so, notwithstanding all its\nweakness, may not fail. He afterwards discusses more at large how our\nhearts necessarily follow the impulse of God; and he asserts that the Lord\ndraws men with their own wills, but that those wills are such as he\nhimself has formed. Now, we have a testimony from the mouth of Augustine\nto the point which we are principally endeavouring to establish; that\ngrace is not merely offered by the Lord to be either received or rejected,\naccording to the free choice of each individual, but that it is grace\nwhich produces both the choice and the will in the heart; so that every\nsubsequent good work is the fruit and effect of it, and that it is obeyed\nby no other will but that which it has produced. For this is his language\nalso in another place—that it is grace alone which performs every good\nwork in us.\nXIV. When he observes that the will is not taken away by grace, but only\nchanged from a bad one into a good one, and when it is good, assisted; he\nonly intends that man is not drawn in such a manner as to be carried away\nby an external impulse, without any inclination of his mind; but that he\nis internally so disposed as to obey from his very heart. That grace is\nspecially and gratuitously given to the elect, he maintains in an epistle\nto Boniface, in the following language: “We know that the grace of God is\nnot given to all men; and that to them to whom it is given, it is given\nneither according to the merits of works, nor according to the merits of\nwill, but by gratuitous favour; and to those to whom it is not given, we\nknow that it is not given by the righteous judgment of God.” And in the\nsame epistle, he strenuously combats that opinion, which supposes that\nsubsequent grace is given to the merits of men, because by not rejecting\nthe first grace they showed themselves worthy of it. For he wishes\nPelagius to allow that grace is necessary to us for every one of our\nactions, and is not a retribution of our works, that it may be\nacknowledged to be pure grace. But the subject cannot be comprised in a\nmore concise summary than in the eighth chapter of his treatise addressed\nto Valentine; where he teaches, that the human will obtains, not grace by\nliberty, but liberty by grace; that being impressed by the same grace with\na disposition of delight, it is formed for perpetuity; that it is\nstrengthened with invincible fortitude; that while grace reigns, it never\nfalls, but, deserted by grace, falls immediately; that by the gratuitous\nmercy of the Lord, it is converted to what is good, and, being converted,\nperseveres in it; that the first direction of the human will to that which\nis good, and its subsequent constancy, depend solely on the will of God,\nand not on any merit of man. Thus there is left to man such a free will,\nif we choose to give it that appellation, as he describes in another\nplace, that he can neither be converted to God nor continue in God but by\ngrace; and that all the ability which he has is derived from grace."

          "content": "It has now, I apprehend, been sufficiently proved, that man is so enslaved\nby sin, as to be of his own nature incapable of an effort, or even an\naspiration, towards that which is good. We have also laid down a\ndistinction between coaction and necessity, from which it appears that\nwhile he sins necessarily, he nevertheless sins voluntarily. But since,\nwhile he is devoted to the servitude of the devil, he seems to be actuated\nby his will, rather than by his own, it remains for us to explain the\nnature of both kinds of influence. There is also this question to be\nresolved, whether any thing is to be attributed to God in evil actions, in\nwhich the Scripture intimates that some influence of his is concerned.\nAugustine somewhere compares the human will to a horse, obedient to the\ndirection of his rider; and God and the devil he compares to riders. “If\nGod rides it, he, like a sober and skilful rider, manages it in a graceful\nmanner; stimulates its tardiness; restrains its immoderate celerity;\nrepresses its wantonness and wildness; tames its perverseness, and\nconducts it into the right way. But if the devil has taken possession of\nit, he, like a foolish and wanton rider, forces it through pathless\nplaces, hurries it into ditches, drives it down over precipices, and\nexcites it to obstinacy and ferocity.” With this similitude, as no better\noccurs, we will at present be content. When the will of a natural man is\nsaid to be subject to the power of the devil, so as to be directed by it,\nthe meaning is, not that it resists and is compelled to a reluctant\nsubmission, as masters compel slaves to an unwilling performance of their\ncommands, but that, being fascinated by the fallacies of Satan, it\nnecessarily submits itself to all his directions. For those whom the Lord\ndoes not favour with the government of his Spirit, he abandons, in\nrighteous judgment, to the influence of Satan. Wherefore the Apostle says,\nthat “the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe\nnot,” who are destined to destruction, “lest the light of the gospel\nshould shine unto them.”(654) And in another place, that he “worketh in\nthe children of disobedience.”(655) The blinding of the wicked, and all\nthose enormities which attend it, are called the works of Satan; the cause\nof which must nevertheless be sought only in the human will, from which\nproceeds the root of evil, and in which rests the foundation of the\nkingdom of Satan, that is, sin.\nII. Very different, in such instances, is the method of the Divine\noperation. And that we may have a clearer view of it, let us take as an\nexample the calamity which holy Job suffered from the Chaldeans.(656) The\nChaldeans massacred his shepherds, and committed hostile depredations on\nhis flock. Now, the wickedness of their procedure is evident; yet in these\ntransactions Satan was not unconcerned; for with him the history states\nthe whole affair to have originated. But Job himself recognizes in it the\nwork of the Lord, whom he asserts to have taken from him those things of\nwhich he had been plundered by the Chaldeans. How can we refer the same\naction to God, to Satan, and to man, as being each the author of it,\nwithout either excusing Satan by associating him with God, or making God\nthe author of evil? Very easily, if we examine, first, the end for which\nthe action was designed, and secondly, the manner in which it was\neffected. The design of the Lord is to exercise the patience of his\nservant by adversity; Satan endeavours to drive him to despair: the\nChaldeans, in defiance of law and justice, desire to enrich themselves by\nthe property of another. So great a diversity of design makes a great\ndistinction in the action. There is no less difference in the manner. The\nLord permits his servant to be afflicted by Satan: the Chaldeans, whom he\ncommissions to execute his purpose, he permits and resigns to be impelled\nby Satan: Satan, with his envenomed stings, instigates the minds of the\nChaldeans, otherwise very depraved, to perpetrate the crime: they\nfuriously rush into the act of injustice, and overwhelm themselves in\ncriminality. Satan therefore is properly said to work in the reprobate, in\nwhom he exercises his dominion; that is, the kingdom of iniquity. God also\nis said to work in a way proper to himself, because Satan, being the\ninstrument of his wrath, turns himself hither and thither at his\nappointment and command, to execute his righteous judgments. Here I allude\nnot to the universal influence of God, by which all creatures are\nsustained, and from which they derive an ability to perform whatever they\ndo. I speak only of that special influence which appears in every\nparticular act. We see, then, that the same action is without absurdity\nascribed to God, to Satan, and to man; but the variety in the end and in\nthe manner, causes the righteousness of God to shine without the least\nblemish, and the iniquity of Satan and of man to betray itself to its own\ndisgrace.\nIII. The fathers are sometimes too scrupulous on this subject, and afraid\nof a simple confession of the truth, lest they should afford an occasion\nto impiety to speak irreverently and reproachfully of the works of God.\nThough I highly approve this sobriety, yet I think we are in no danger, if\nwe simply maintain what the Scripture delivers. Even Augustine at one time\nwas not free from this scrupulosity; as when he says that hardening and\nblinding belong not to the operation, but to the prescience of God. But\nthese subtleties are inconsistent with numerous expressions of the\nScripture, which evidently import some intervention of God beyond mere\nforeknowledge. And Augustine himself, in his fifth book against Julian,\ncontends very largely, that sins proceed not only from the permission or\nthe prescience, but from the power of God, in order that former sins may\nthereby be punished. So also what they advance concerning permission is\ntoo weak to be supported. God is very frequently said to blind and harden\nthe reprobate, and to turn, incline, and influence their hearts, as I have\nelsewhere more fully stated. But it affords no explication of the nature\nof this influence to resort to prescience or permission. We answer,\ntherefore, that it operates in two ways. For, since, when his light is\nremoved, nothing remains but darkness and blindness; since, when his\nSpirit is withdrawn, our hearts harden into stones; since, when his\ndirection ceases, they are warped into obliquity; he is properly said to\nblind, harden, and incline those whom he deprives of the power of seeing,\nobeying, and acting aright. The second way, which is much more consistent\nwith strict propriety of language, is, when, for the execution of his\njudgments, he, by means of Satan, the minister of his wrath, directs their\ncounsels to what he pleases, and excites their wills and strengthens their\nefforts. Thus, when Moses relates that Sihon the king would not grant a\nfree passage to the people, because God had “hardened his spirit, and made\nhis heart obstinate,” he immediately subjoins the end of God’s design:\n“That he might deliver him into thy hand.”(657) Since God willed his\ndestruction, the obduration of his heart, therefore, was the Divine\npreparation for his ruin.\nIV. The following expressions seem to relate to the former method: “He\nremoveth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding\nof the aged. He taketh away the heart of the chief people of the earth,\nand causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.”(658)\nAgain: “O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened\nour heart from thy fear?”(659) For these passages rather indicate what God\nmakes men by deserting them, than show how he performs his operations\nwithin them. But there are other testimonies, which go further; as those\nwhich relate to the hardening of Pharaoh: “I will harden his (Pharaoh’s)\nheart, that he shall not let the people go.”(660) Afterwards the Lord\nsays, “I have hardened his heart.”(661) Did he harden it by not mollifying\nit? That is true; but he did somewhat more, for he delivered his heart to\nSatan to be confirmed in obstinacy; whence he had before said, “I will\nharden his heart.” The people march out of Egypt; the inhabitants of the\ncountry meet them in a hostile manner: by whom were they excited? Moses\nexpressly declared to the people, that it was the Lord who had hardened\ntheir hearts.(662) The Psalmist, reciting the same history, says, “He\nturned their heart to hate his people.”(663) Now, it cannot be said that\nthey fell in consequence of being deprived of the counsel of God. For if\nthey are “hardened” and “turned,” they are positively inclined to that\npoint. Besides, whenever it has pleased him to punish the transgressions\nof his people, how has he executed his work by means of the reprobate? In\nsuch a manner that any one may see, that the efficacy of the action\nproceeded from him, and that they were only the ministers of his will.\nWherefore he threatened sometimes that he would call them forth by\nhissing,(664) sometimes that he would use them as a net(665) to entangle,\nsometimes as a hammer(666) to strike the people of Israel. But he\nparticularly declared himself to be operative in them, when he called\nSennacherib an axe,(667) which was both directed and driven by his hand.\nAugustine somewhere makes the following correct distinction: “that they\nsin, proceeds from themselves; that in sinning they perform this or that\nparticular action, is from the power of God, who divides the darkness\naccording to his pleasure.”\nV. Now that the ministry of Satan is concerned in instigating the\nreprobate, whenever the Lord directs them hither or thither by his\nprovidence, may be sufficiently proved even from one passage. For it is\nfrequently asserted in Samuel that an evil spirit of the Lord, and an evil\nspirit from the Lord, either agitated or quitted Saul.(668) To refer this\nto the Holy Spirit were impious. An impure spirit, therefore, is called a\nspirit of God, because it acts according to his command and by his power,\nbeing rather an instrument in the performance of the action, than itself\nthe author of it. We must add, also, what is advanced by Paul, that “God\nshall send strong delusion, that they who believed not the truth should\nbelieve a lie.”(669) Yet there is always a wide difference, even in the\nsame work, between the operation of God and the attempts of Satan and\nwicked men. He makes the evil instruments, which he has in his hand, and\ncan turn as he pleases, to be subservient to his justice. They, as they\nare evil, produce the iniquity which the depravity of their nature has\nconceived. The other arguments, which tend to vindicate the majesty of God\nfrom every calumny, and to obviate the cavils of the impious, have already\nbeen advanced in the chapter concerning Providence. For, at present, I\nonly intend briefly to show how Satan reigns in the reprobate man, and how\nthe Lord operates in them both.\nVI. But what liberty man possesses in those actions which in themselves\nare neither righteous nor wicked, and pertain rather to the corporeal than\nto the spiritual life, although we have before hinted, has not yet been\nexplicitly stated. Some have admitted him in such things to possess a free\nchoice; rather, as I suppose, from a reluctance to dispute on a subject of\nno importance, than from an intention of positively asserting that which\nthey concede. Now, though I grant that they who believe themselves to be\npossessed of no power to justify themselves, believe what is principally\nnecessary to be known in order to salvation, yet I think that this point\nalso should not be neglected, that we may know it to be owing to the\nspecial favour of God, whenever our mind is disposed to choose that which\nis advantageous for us; whenever our will inclines to it; and, on the\nother hand, whenever our mind and understanding avoid what would otherwise\nhurt us. And the power of the providence of God extends so far, as not\nonly to cause those events to succeed which he foresees will be best, but\nalso to incline the wills of men to the same objects. Indeed, if we view\nthe administration of external things with our own reason, we shall not\ndoubt their subjection to the human will; but if we listen to the numerous\ntestimonies, which proclaim that in these things also the hearts of men\nare governed by the Lord, they will constrain us to submit the will itself\nto the special influence of God. Who conciliated the minds of the\nEgyptians towards the Israelites,(670) so as to induce them to lend them\nthe most valuable of their furniture? They would never have been induced\nto do this of their own accord. It follows, therefore, that their hearts\nwere guided by the Lord rather than by an inclination of their own. And\nJacob, if he had not been persuaded that God infuses various dispositions\ninto men according to his pleasure, would not have said concerning his son\nJoseph, whom he thought to be some profane Egyptian, “God Almighty give\nyou mercy before the man.”(671) As the whole Church confesses in the\nPsalms, that, when God chose to compassionate her, he softened the hearts\nof the cruel nations into clemency.(672) Again, when Saul was so inflamed\nwith rage, as to prepare himself for war, it is expressly mentioned as the\ncause, that he was impelled by the Spirit of God.(673) Who diverted the\nmind of Absalom from adopting the counsel of Ahithophel, which used to be\nesteemed as an oracle?(674) Who inclined Rehoboam to be persuaded by the\ncounsel of the young men?(675) Who caused the nations, that before were\nvery valiant, to feel terror at the approach of the Israelites? Rahab the\nharlot confessed that this was the work of God. Who, on the other hand,\ndejected the minds of the Israelites with fear and terror, but he who had\nthreatened in the law that he would “send a faintness into their\nhearts?”(676)\nVII. Some one will object, that these are peculiar examples, to the rule\nof which, things ought by no means universally to be reduced. But I\nmaintain, that they are sufficient to prove that for which I contend; that\nGod, whenever he designs to prepare the way for his providence, inclines\nand moves the wills of men even in external things, and that their choice\nis not so free, but that its liberty is subject to the will of God. That\nyour mind depends more on the influence of God, than on the liberty of\nyour own choice, you must be constrained to conclude, whether you are\nwilling or not, from this daily experience, that in affairs of no\nperplexity your judgment and understanding frequently fail; that in\nundertakings not arduous your spirits languish; on the other hand, in\nthings the most obscure, suitable advice is immediately offered; in things\ngreat and perilous, your mind proves superior to every difficulty. And\nthus I explain the observation of Solomon, “The hearing ear, and the\nseeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.”(677) For he appears to\nme to speak, not of their creation, but of the peculiar favour of God\ndisplayed in their performing their functions. When he says, that “the\nking’s heart is in the hand of the Lord; as the rivers of water, he\nturneth it whithersoever he will;”(678) under one species he clearly\ncomprehends the whole genus. For if the will of any man be free from all\nsubjection, that privilege belongs eminently to the will of a king, which\nexercises a government in some measure over the wills of others; but if\nthe will of the king be subject to the power of God, ours cannot be\nexempted from the same authority. Augustine has a remarkable passage on\nthis subject: “The Scripture, if it be diligently examined, shows, not\nonly that the good wills of men, which he turns from evil into good, and\ndirects to good actions and to eternal life, but also that those wills\nwhich relate to the present life, are subject to the power of God, so that\nhe, by a most secret, but yet a most righteous judgment, causes them to be\ninclined whither he pleases, and when he pleases, either for the\ncommunication of benefits, or for the infliction of punishments.”\nVIII. Here let the reader remember, that the ability of the human will is\nnot to be estimated from the event of things, as some ignorant men are\npreposterously accustomed to do. For they conceive themselves fully and\ningeniously to establish the servitude of the human will, because even the\nmost exalted monarchs have not all their desires fulfilled. But this\nability, of which we speak, is to be considered within man, and not to be\nmeasured by external success. For in the dispute concerning free will, the\nquestion is not, whether a man, notwithstanding external impediments, can\nperform and execute whatever he may have resolved in his mind, but whether\nin every case his judgment exerts freedom of choice, and his will freedom\nof inclination. If men possess both these, then Attilius Regulus, when\nconfined to the small extent of a cask stuck round with nails, will\npossess as much free will as Augustus Cæsar, when governing a great part\nof the world with his nod."

          "title": "Chapter V. A Refutation Of The Objections Commonly Urged In Support Of",
          "content": "Free Will.\nEnough might appear to have been already said on the servitude of the\nhuman will, did not they, who endeavour to overthrow it with a false\nnotion of liberty, allege, on the contrary, certain reasons in opposition\nto our sentiments. First, they collect together some absurdities, in order\nto render it odious, as if it were abhorrent to common sense; and then\nthey attack it with testimonies of Scripture. Both these weapons we will\nrepel in order. If sin, say they, be necessary, then it ceases to be sin;\nif it be voluntary, then it may be avoided. These were also the weapons\nused by Pelagius in his attacks on Augustine; with whose authority,\nhowever, we wish not to urge them, till we shall have given some\nsatisfaction on the subject itself. I deny, then, that sin is the less\ncriminal, because it is necessary; I deny also the other consequence,\nwhich they infer, that it is avoidable because it is voluntary. For, if\nany one wish to dispute with God, and to escape his judgment by the\npretext of having been incapable of acting otherwise, he is prepared with\nan answer, which we have elsewhere advanced, that it arises not from\ncreation, but from the corruption of nature, that men, being enslaved by\nsin, can will nothing but what is evil. For whence proceeded that\nimpotence, of which the ungodly would gladly avail themselves, but from\nAdam voluntarily devoting himself to the tyranny of the devil? Hence,\ntherefore, the corruption with which we are firmly bound. It originated in\nthe revolt of the first man from his Maker. If all men are justly\naccounted guilty of this rebellion, let them not suppose themselves\nexcused by necessity, in which very thing they have a most evident cause\nof their condemnation. And this I have before clearly explained, and have\ngiven an example in the devil himself, which shows, that he who sins\nnecessarily, sins no less voluntarily; and also in the elect angels, whose\nwill, though it cannot swerve from what is good, ceases not to be a will.\nBernard also judiciously inculcates the same doctrine, that we are,\ntherefore, the more miserable because our necessity is voluntary; which\nyet constrains us to be so devoted to it, that we are, as we have already\nobserved, the slaves of sin. The second branch of their argument is\nerroneous; because it makes an improper transition from what is voluntary\nto what is free; but we have before evinced, that a thing may be done\nvoluntarily, which yet is not the subject of free choice.\nII. They add, that unless both virtues and vices proceed from the free\nchoice of the will, it is not reasonable either that punishments should be\ninflicted, or that rewards should be conferred on man. This argument,\nthough first advanced by Aristotle, yet I grant is used on some occasions\nby Chrysostom and Jerome. That it was familiar to the Pelagians, however,\nJerome himself does not dissemble, but even relates their own words: “If\nthe grace of God operates in us, then the crown will be given to grace,\nnot to us who labour.” In regard to punishments, I reply, that they are\njustly inflicted on us, from whom the guilt of sin proceeds. For of what\nimportance is it, whether sin be committed with a judgment free or\nenslaved, so it be committed with the voluntary bias of the passions;\nespecially as man is proved to be a sinner, because he is subject to the\nservitude of sin? With respect to rewards of righteousness, where is the\ngreat absurdity, if we confess that they depend rather on the Divine\nbenignity than on our own merits? How often does this recur in Augustine,\n“that God crowns not our merits, but his own gifts; and that they are\ncalled rewards, not as though they were due to our merits, but because\nthey are retributions to the graces already conferred on us!” They\ndiscover great acuteness in this observation, that there remains no room\nfor merits, if they originate not from free will; but in their opinion of\nthe erroneousness of our sentiment they are greatly mistaken. For\nAugustine hesitates not on all occasions to inculcate as certain, what\nthey think it impious to acknowledge; as where he says, “What are the\nmerits of any man? When he comes not with a merited reward, but with free\ngrace, he alone being free and a deliverer from sins, finds all men\nsinners.” Again: “If you receive what is your due, you must be punished.\nWhat then is done? God has given you not merited punishment, but unmerited\ngrace. If you wish to be excluded from grace, boast your merits.” Again:\n“You are nothing of yourself; sins are yours, merits belong to God; you\ndeserve punishment; and when you come to be rewarded, he will crown his\nown gifts, not your merits.” In the same sense he elsewhere teaches that\ngrace proceeds not from merit, but merit from grace. And a little after he\nconcludes, that God with his gifts precedes all merits, that thence he may\nelicit his other merits, and gives altogether freely, because he discovers\nnothing as a cause of salvation. But what necessity is there for further\nquotations, when his writings are full of such passages? But the Apostle\nwill even better deliver them from this error, if they will hear from what\norigin he deduces the glory of the saints. “Whom he did predestinate, them\nhe also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he\njustified, them he also glorified.”(679) Why, then, according to the\nApostle, are the faithful crowned? Because by the mercy of the Lord, and\nnot by their own industry, they are elected, and called, and justified.\nFarewell, then, this vain fear, that there will be an end of all merits if\nfree will be overturned. For it is a proof of extreme folly, to be\nterrified and to fly from that to which the Scripture calls us. “If,” says\nhe, “thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not\nreceived it?”(680) You see that he divests free will of every thing, with\nthe express design of leaving no room for merits. But yet, the beneficence\nand liberality of God being inexhaustible and various, those graces which\nhe confers on us, because he makes them ours, he rewards, just as if they\nwere our own virtues.\nIII. They further allege what may appear to be borrowed from Chrysostom,\nthat if our will has not this ability to choose good or evil, the\npartakers of the same nature must be either all evil or all good. And not\nvery far from this is the writer, whoever he was, of the treatise _On the\nCalling of the Gentiles_, which is circulated under the name of Ambrose,\nwhen he argues, that no man would ever recede from the faith, unless the\ngrace of God left us the condition of mutability. In which it is\nsurprising that such great men were so inconsistent with themselves. For\nhow did it not occur to Chrysostom, that it is the election of God, which\nmakes this difference between men? We are not afraid to allow, what Paul\nvery strenuously asserts, that all, without exception, are depraved and\naddicted to wickedness; but with him we add, that the mercy of God does\nnot permit all to remain in depravity. Therefore, since we all naturally\nlabour under the same disease, they alone recover to whom the Lord has\nbeen pleased to apply his healing hand. The rest, whom he passes by in\nrighteous judgment, putrefy in their corruption till they are entirely\nconsumed. And it is from the same cause, that some persevere to the end,\nand others decline and fall in the midst of their course. For perseverance\nitself also is a gift of God, which he bestows not on all men\npromiscuously, but imparts to whom he pleases. If we inquire the cause of\nthe difference, why some persevere with constancy, and others fail through\ninstability, no other can be found, but that God sustains the former by\nhis power, that they perish not, and does not communicate the same\nstrength to the latter, that they may be examples of inconstancy.\nIV. They urge further, that exhortations are given in vain, that the use\nof admonitions is superfluous, and that reproofs are ridiculous, if it be\nnot in the power of the sinner to obey. When similar objections were\nformerly made to Augustine, he was obliged to write his treatise _On\nCorrection and Grace_; in which, though he copiously refutes them, he\ncalls his adversaries to this conclusion: “O man, in the commandment learn\nwhat is your duty: in correction learn, that through your own fault you\nhave it not: in prayer learn whence you may receive what you wish to\nenjoy.” There is nearly the same argument in the treatise _On the Spirit\nand Letter_, in which he maintains that God does not regulate the precepts\nof his law by the ability of men, but when he has commanded what is right,\nfreely gives to his elect ability to perform it. This is not a subject\nthat requires a prolix discussion. First, we are not alone in this cause,\nbut have the support of Christ and all the Apostles. Let our opponents\nconsider how they can obtain the superiority in a contest with such\nantagonists. Does Christ, who declares that without him we can do\nnothing,(681) on that account the less reprehend and punish those who\nwithout him do what is evil? Does he therefore relax in his exhortations\nto every man to practise good works? How severely does Paul censure the\nCorinthians for their neglect of charity!(682) Yet he earnestly prays that\ncharity may be given them by the Lord. In his Epistle to the Romans he\ndeclares that “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but\nof God that showeth mercy:”(683) yet afterwards he refrains not from the\nuse of admonition, exhortation, and reproof. Why do they not, therefore,\nremonstrate with the Lord, not to lose his labour in such a manner, by\nrequiring of men those things which he alone can bestow, and punishing\nthose things which are committed for want of his grace? Why do they not\nadmonish Paul to spare those who are unable to will or run without the\nprevious mercy of God, of which they are now destitute? As though truly\nthe Lord has not the best reason for his doctrine, which readily presents\nitself to those who religiously seek it. Paul clearly shows how far\ndoctrine, exhortation, and reproof, can of themselves avail towards\nproducing a change of heart, when he says that “neither is he that\nplanteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but” that the efficacy is\nsolely from “God that giveth the increase.”(684) Thus we see that Moses\nseverely sanctions the precepts of the law, and the Prophets earnestly\nurge and threaten transgressors; whilst, nevertheless, they acknowledge,\nthat men never begin to be wise till a heart is given them to understand;\nthat it is the peculiar work of God to circumcise the heart, and instead\nof a stony heart to give a heart of flesh; to inscribe his law in men’s\nminds; in a word, to render his doctrine effectual by a renovation of the\nsoul.\nV. What, then, it will be inquired, is the use of exhortations? I reply,\nIf the impious despise them with obstinate hearts, they will serve for a\ntestimony against them, when they shall come to the tribunal of the Lord;\nand even in the present state they wound their consciences; for however\nthe most audacious person may deride them, he cannot disapprove of them in\nhis heart. But it will be said, What can a miserable sinner do, if the\nsoftness of heart, which is necessary to obedience, be denied him? I ask,\nWhat excuse can he plead, seeing that he cannot impute the hardness of his\nheart to any one but himself? The impious, therefore, who are ready, if\npossible, to ridicule the Divine precepts and exhortations, are, in spite\nof their own inclinations, confounded by their power. But the principal\nutility should be considered in regard to the faithful, in whom as the\nLord performs all things by his Spirit, so he neglects not the\ninstrumentality of his word, but uses it with great efficacy. Let it be\nallowed, then, as it ought to be, that all the strength of the pious\nconsists in the grace of God, according to this expression of the Prophet:\n“I will give them a new heart, that they may walk in my statutes.”(685)\nBut you will object, Why are they admonished of their duty, and not rather\nleft to the direction of the Spirit? Why are they importuned with\nexhortations, when they cannot make more haste than is produced by the\nimpulse of the Spirit? Why are they chastised, if they have ever deviated\nfrom the right way, seeing that they erred through the necessary infirmity\nof the flesh? I reply, Who art thou, O man, that wouldest impose laws upon\nGod? If it be his will to prepare us by exhortation for the reception of\nthis grace, by which obedience to the exhortation is produced, what have\nyou to censure in this economy? If exhortations and reproofs were of no\nother advantage to the pious, than to convince them of sin, they ought not\non that account to be esteemed wholly useless. Now, since, by the internal\noperation of the Spirit, they are most effectual to inflame the heart with\na love of righteousness, to shake off sloth, to destroy the pleasure and\npoisonous sweetness of iniquity, and, on the contrary, to render it\nhateful and burdensome, who can dare to reject them as superfluous? If any\none would desire a plainer answer, let him take it thus: The operations of\nGod on his elect are twofold—internally, by his Spirit, externally, by his\nword. By his Spirit illuminating their minds and forming their hearts to\nthe love and cultivation of righteousness, he makes them new creatures. By\nhis word he excites them to desire, seek, and obtain the same renovation.\nIn both he displays the efficacy of his power, according to the mode of\nhis dispensation. When he addresses the same word to the reprobate, though\nit produces not their correction, yet he makes it effectual for another\npurpose, that they may be confounded by the testimony of their consciences\nnow, and be rendered more inexcusable at the day of judgment. Thus Christ,\nthough he pronounces that “no man can come to him, except the Father draw\nhim,” and that the elect come when they have “heard and learned of the\nFather,”(686) yet himself neglects not the office of a teacher, but with\nhis own mouth sedulously invites those who need the internal teachings of\nthe Holy Spirit to enable them to derive any benefit from his\ninstructions. With respect to the reprobate, Paul suggests that teaching\nis not useless, because it is to them “the savour of death unto death,”\nbut “a sweet savour unto God.”(687)\nVI. Our adversaries are very laborious in collecting testimonies of\nScripture; and this with a view, since they cannot refute us with their\nweight, to overwhelm us with their number. But as in battles, when armies\ncome to close combat, the weak multitude, whatever pomp and ostentation\nthey may display, are soon defeated and routed, so it will be very easy\nfor us to vanquish them, with all their multitude. For as all the\npassages, which they abuse in their opposition to us, when properly\nclassed and distributed, centre in a very few topics, one answer will be\nsufficient for many of them; it will not be necessary to dwell on a\nparticular explication of each. Their principal argument they derive from\nthe precepts; which they suppose to be so proportioned to our ability,\nthat whatever they can be proved to require, it necessarily follows we are\ncapable of performing. They proceed, therefore, to a particular detail of\nthem, and by them measure the extent of our strength. Either, say they,\nGod mocks us, when he commands holiness, piety, obedience, chastity, love,\nand meekness, and when he forbids impurity, idolatry, unchastity, anger,\nrobbery, pride, and the like; or he requires only such things as we have\npower to perform. Now, almost all the precepts which they collect, may be\ndistributed into three classes. Some require the first conversion to God;\nothers simply relate to the observation of the law; others enjoin\nperseverance in the grace of God already received. Let us first speak of\nthem all in general, and then proceed to the particulars. To represent the\nability of man as coëxtensive with the precepts of the Divine law, has\nindeed for a long time not been unusual, and has some appearance of\nplausibility; but it has proceeded from the grossest ignorance of the law.\nFor those who think it an enormous crime to say that the observation of\nthe law is impossible, insist on this very cogent argument, that otherwise\nthe law was given in vain. For they argue just as if Paul had never said\nany thing concerning the law. But, pray, what is the meaning of these\nexpressions—“The law was added because of transgressions;” “by the law is\nthe knowledge of sin;” “the law worketh wrath;” “the law entered that the\noffence might abound?”(688) Do they imply a necessity of its being limited\nto our ability, that it might not be given in vain? Do they not rather\nshow that it was placed far beyond our ability, in order to convince us of\nour impotence? According to the definition of the same Apostle, “the end\nof the commandment is charity.”(689) But when he wishes the minds of the\nThessalonians to “abound in love,”(690) he plainly acknowledges that the\nlaw sounds in our ears in vain, unless God inspire the principles of it\ninto our hearts.\nVII. Indeed, if the Scripture taught only that the law is the rule of\nlife, to which our conduct ought to be conformed, I would immediately\naccede to their opinion. But since it carefully and perspicuously states\nto us various uses of the law, it will be best to consider the operation\nof the law in man according to that exposition. As far as relates to the\npresent argument, when it has prescribed any thing to be performed by us,\nit teaches that the power of obedience proceeds from the goodness of God,\nand therefore invites us to pray that it may be given us. If there were\nonly a commandment, and no promise, there would be a trial of the\nsufficiency of our strength to obey the commandment; but since the\ncommands are connected with promises, which declare that we must derive\nnot only subsidiary power, but our whole strength, from the assistance of\nDivine grace, they furnish abundant evidence that we are not only unequal\nto the observation of the law, but altogether incapable of it. Wherefore\nlet them no more urge the proportion of our ability to the precepts of the\nlaw, as though the Lord had regulated the standard of righteousness, which\nhe designed to give in the law, according to the measure of our\nimbecility. It should rather be concluded from the promises, how\nunprepared we are of ourselves, since we stand in such universal need of\nhis grace. But will it, say they, be credited by any, that the Lord\naddressed his law to stocks and stones? I reply, that no one will attempt\nto inculcate such a notion. For neither are the impious stocks or stones,\nwhen they are taught by the law the contrariety of their dispositions to\nGod, and are convicted of guilt by the testimony of their own minds; nor\nthe pious, when, admonished of their own impotence, they have recourse to\nthe grace of God. To this purpose are the following passages from\nAugustine: “God gives commands which we cannot perform, that we may know\nwhat we ought to request of him. The utility of the precepts is great, if\nonly so much be given to free will, that the grace of God may receive the\ngreater honour. Faith obtains what the law commands; and the law therefore\ncommands, that faith may obtain that which is commanded by the law:\nmoreover God requires faith itself of us, and finds not what he requires,\nunless he has given what he finds.” Again: “Let God give what he enjoins,\nand let him enjoin what he pleases.”\nVIII. This will more clearly appear in an examination of the three kinds\nof precepts which we have already mentioned. The Lord, both in the law and\nin the prophets, frequently commands us to be converted to him;(691) but\nthe Prophet, on the other hand, says, “Turn thou me, and I shall be\nturned.” “After that I was turned, I repented,” &c.(692) He commands us to\ncircumcise our hearts; but he announces by Moses, that this circumcision\nis the work of his own hand.(693) He frequently requires newness of heart;\nbut elsewhere declares that this is his own gift.(694) “What God\npromises,” Augustine says, “we do not perform ourselves through free will\nor nature; but he does it himself by his grace.” And this is the\nobservation to which he himself assigns the fifth place in his enumeration\nof Ticonius’s rules of Christian doctrine; that we should make a proper\ndistinction between the law and the promises, or between the commandments\nand grace. This may suffice, in answer to those who from the precepts\ninfer an ability in man to obey them, that they may destroy the grace of\nGod, by which those very precepts are fulfilled. The precepts of the\nsecond class are simple, enjoining on us the worship of God, constant\nsubmission to his will, observance of his commands, and adherence to his\ndoctrine. But there are innumerable passages, which prove that the highest\ndegree of righteousness, sanctity, piety, and purity, capable of being\nattained, is his own gift. Of the third class is that exhortation of Paul\nand Barnabas to the faithful, mentioned by Luke, “to continue in the grace\nof God.”(695) But whence the grace of perseverance should be sought, the\nsame Apostle informs us, when he says, “Finally, my brethren, be strong in\nthe Lord.”(696) In another place he cautions us to “grieve not the Holy\nSpirit of God, whereby we are sealed unto the day of redemption.”(697) But\nbecause what he there requires could not be performed by men, he prays for\nthe Thessalonians, “that our God would count them worthy of this calling,\nand fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith\nwith power.”(698) Thus, also, in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians,\ntreating of alms, he frequently commends their benevolent and pious\ndisposition;(699) yet a little after he gives thanks to God for having\ninclined the heart of Titus to “accept” or undertake “the exhortation.” If\nTitus could not even use his own tongue to exhort others without having\nbeen prompted by God, how should others have been inclined to act, unless\nGod himself had directed their hearts?\nIX. Our more subtle adversaries cavil at all these testimonies, because\nthere is no impediment, they say, that prevents our exerting our own\nability, and God assisting our weak efforts. They adduce also passages\nfrom the Prophets, where the accomplishment of our conversion seems to be\ndivided equally between God and us. “Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto\nyou.”(700) What assistance we receive from the Lord has already been\nshown, and needs not to be repeated here. I wish only this single point to\nbe conceded to me, that it is in vain to infer our possession of ability\nto fulfil the law from God’s command to us to obey it; since it is\nevident, that for the performance of all the Divine precepts, the grace of\nthe Legislator is both necessary for us, and promised to us; and hence it\nfollows, that at least more is required of us than we are capable of\nperforming. Nor is it possible for any cavils to explain away that passage\nof Jeremiah, which assures us, that the covenant of God, made with his\nancient people, was frustrated because it was merely a literal one;(701)\nand that it can only be confirmed by the influence of the Spirit, who\nforms the heart to obedience. Nor does their error derive any support from\nthis passage: “Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto you.” For this\ndenotes, not that turning of God in which he renovates our hearts to\nrepentance, but that in which he declares his benevolence and kindness by\nexternal prosperity; as by adversity he sometimes manifests his\ndispleasure. When the people of Israel, therefore, after having been\nharassed with miseries and calamities under various forms, complained that\nGod was departed from them, he replies that his benignity will not fail\nthem if they return to rectitude of life, and to himself, who is the\nstandard of righteousness. The passage, then, is miserably perverted, when\nit is made to represent the work of conversion as divided between God and\nmen. We have observed the greater brevity on these points, because it will\nbe a more suitable place for this argument when we treat of the Law.\nX. The second description of arguments is nearly allied to the first. They\nallege the promises, in which God covenants with our will; such as, “Seek\ngood, and not evil, that ye may live.” “If ye be willing and obedient, ye\nshall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be\ndevoured with the sword; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”(702)\nAgain: “If thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then\nshalt thou not remove.” “If thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice\nof the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I\ncommand thee this day, the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all\nnations of the earth;”(703) and other similar passages. They consider it\nan absurdity and mockery, that the benefits which the Lord offers in the\npromises are referred to our will, unless it be in our power either to\nconfirm or to frustrate them. And truly it is very easy to amplify this\nsubject with eloquent complaints, that we are cruelly mocked by the Lord,\nwhen he announces that his benignity depends on our will, if that will be\nnot in our own power; that this would be egregious liberality in God, to\npresent his benefits to us in such a manner, that we should have no power\nto enjoy them; and that there must be a strange certainty in his promises,\nif they depend on a thing impossible, so that they can never be fulfilled.\nConcerning promises of this kind, to which a condition is annexed, we\nshall speak in another place, and evince that there is no absurdity in the\nimpossibility of their completion. With respect to the present question, I\ndeny that God is cruel or insincere to us, when he invites us to merit his\nfavours, though he knows us to be altogether incapable of doing this. For\nas the promises are offered equally to the faithful and to the impious,\nthey have their use with them both. As by the precepts God disturbs the\nconsciences of the impious, that they may not enjoy too much pleasure in\nsin without any recollection of his judgments, so in the promises he calls\nthem to attest how unworthy they are of his kindness. For who can deny\nthat it is most equitable and proper for the Lord to bless those who\nworship him, and severely to punish the despisers of his majesty? God\nacts, therefore, in a right and orderly manner, when, addressing the\nimpious, who are bound with the fetters of sin, he adds to the promises\nthis condition, that when they shall have departed from their wickedness,\nthey shall then, and not till then, enjoy his favours; even for this sole\nreason, that they may know that they are deservedly excluded from those\nbenefits which belong to the worshippers of the true God. On the other\nhand, since he designs by all means to stimulate the faithful to implore\nhis grace, it will not be at all strange, if he tries in his promises\nalso, what we have shown he does with considerable effect in his precepts.\nBeing instructed by the precepts concerning the will of God, we are\napprized of our misery, in having our hearts so completely averse to it;\nand are at the same time excited to invoke his Spirit, that we may be\ndirected by him into the right way. But because our sluggishness is not\nsufficiently roused by the precepts, God adds his promises, to allure us\nby their sweetness to the love of his commands. Now, in proportion to our\nincreased love of righteousness will be the increase of our fervour in\nseeking the grace of God. See how, in these addresses, “If ye be willing,”\n“If ye be obedient,” the Lord neither attributes to us an unlimited power\nto will and to obey, nor yet mocks us on account of our impotence.\nXI. The third class of arguments also has a great affinity with the\npreceding. For they produce passages in which God reproaches an ungrateful\npeople, that it was wholly owing to their own fault that they did not\nreceive blessings of all kinds from his indulgent hand. Of this kind are\nthe following passages: “The Amalekites and the Canaanites are there\nbefore you, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye are turned away\nfrom the Lord.”(704) “Because I called you, but ye answered not, therefore\nwill I do unto this house as I have done to Shiloh.”(705) Again: “This is\na nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth\ncorrection: the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his\nwrath.”(706) Again: “They obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law;\nthey have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore\nthou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.”(707) How, say they,\ncould such reproaches be applicable to those who might immediately reply,\nIt is true that we desired prosperity and dreaded adversity; but our not\nobeying the Lord, or hearkening to his voice, in order to obtain good and\nto avoid evil, has been owing to our want of liberty, and subjection to\nthe dominion of sin. It is in vain, therefore, to reproach us with evils,\nwhich we had no power to avoid. In answer to this, leaving the pretext of\nnecessity, which is but a weak and futile plea, I ask whether they can\nexculpate themselves from all guilt. For if they are convicted of any\nfault, the Lord justly reproaches them with their perverseness, as the\ncause of their not having experienced the advantage of his clemency. Let\nthem answer, then, if they can deny that their own perverse will was the\ncause of their obstinacy. If they find the source of the evil within\nthemselves, why do they so earnestly inquire after extraneous causes, that\nthey may not appear to have been the authors of their own ruin? But if it\nbe true that sinners are deprived of the favours of God, and chastised\nwith his punishments, for their own sin, and only for their own, there is\ngreat reason why they should hear those reproaches from his mouth; that if\nthey obstinately persist in their crimes, they may learn in their\ncalamities rather to accuse and detest their iniquity, than to charge God\nwith unrighteous cruelty; that if they have not cast off all docility,\nthey may become weary of their sins, the demerits of which they see to be\nmisery and ruin, and may return into the good way, acknowledging in a\nserious confession the very thing for which the Lord rebukes them. And\nthat those reproofs, which are quoted from the Prophets, have produced\nthis beneficial effect on the faithful, is evident from the solemn prayer\nof Daniel, given us in his ninth chapter. Of the former use of them we\nfind an example in the Jews, to whom Jeremiah is commanded to declare the\ncause of their miseries; though nothing could befall them, otherwise than\nthe Lord had foretold. “Thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but\nthey will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they\nwill not answer thee.”(708) For what purpose, then, it will be asked, did\nthey speak to persons that were deaf? It was in order that, in spite of\ntheir disinclination and aversion, they might know what was declared to\nthem to be true; that it was an abominable sacrilege to transfer to God\nthe guilt of their crimes, which belonged solely to themselves. With these\nfew solutions, we may very easily despatch the immense multitude of\ntestimonies, which the enemies of the grace of God are accustomed to\ncollect, both from the precepts of the law, and from the expostulations\ndirected to transgressors of it, in order to establish the idol of free\nwill. In one psalm the Jews are stigmatized as “a stubborn and rebellious\ngeneration, a generation that set not their heart aright.”(709) In\nanother, the Psalmist exhorts the men of his age to “harden not their\nhearts;”(710) which implies, that all the guilt of rebellion lies in the\nperverseness of men. But it is absurd to infer from this passage that the\nheart is equally flexible to either side; whereas “the preparation” of it\nis “from the Lord.”(711) The Psalmist says, “I have inclined my heart to\nperform thy statutes;”(712) because he had devoted himself to the service\nof God without any reluctance, but with a cheerful readiness of mind. Yet\nhe boasts not of being himself the author of this inclination, which in\nthe same psalm he acknowledges to be the gift of God.(713) We should\nremember, therefore, the admonition of Paul, when he commands the faithful\nto “work out” their “own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God\nwhich worketh in” them “both to will and to do.”(714) He assigns them a\npart to perform, that they may not indulge themselves in carnal\nnegligence; but by inculcating “fear and trembling,” he humbles them, and\nreminds them that this very thing, which they are commanded to do, is the\npeculiar work of God. In this he plainly suggests that the faithful act,\nif I may be allowed the expression, passively, inasmuch as they are\nfurnished with strength from heaven, that they may arrogate nothing at all\nto themselves. Wherefore, when Peter exhorts us to “add to” our “faith,\nvirtue,”(715) he does not allot us an under part to be performed, as\nthough we could do any thing separately, of ourselves; he only arouses the\nindolence of the flesh, by which faith itself is frequently extinguished.\nTo the same purpose is the exhortation of Paul: “Quench not the\nSpirit;”(716) for slothfulness gradually prevails over the faithful,\nunless it be corrected. But if any one should infer from this, that it is\nat his own option to cherish the light offered him, his ignorance will\neasily be refuted; since this diligence which Paul requires, proceeds only\nfrom God. For we are also frequently commanded to “cleanse ourselves from\nall filthiness,”(717) whilst the Spirit claims the office of sanctifying\nus exclusively to himself. In short, that what properly belongs to God is,\nby concession, transferred to us, is plain from the words of John: “He\nthat is begotten of God, keepeth himself.”(718) The preachers of free will\nlay hold of this expression, as though we were saved partly by the Divine\npower, partly by our own; as though we did not receive from heaven this\nvery preservation which the Apostle mentions. Wherefore also Christ prays\nthat his Father would “keep” us “from evil;”(719) and we know that the\npious, in their warfare against Satan, obtain the victory by no other arms\nthan those which are furnished by God. Therefore Peter, having enjoined us\nto “purify” our “souls, in obeying the truth,” immediately adds, as a\ncorrection, “through the Spirit.”(720) Finally, the impotence of all human\nstrength in the spiritual conflict is briefly demonstrated by John when he\nsays, “Whosoever is born of God cannot sin; for his seed remaineth in\nhim:”(721) and in another place he adds the reason, that “this is the\nvictory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”(722)\nXII. There is also a testimony cited from the law of Moses, which appears\ndirectly repugnant to our solution. For, after having published the law,\nhe makes the following solemn declaration to the people: “This\ncommandment, which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee,\nneither is it far off: it is not in heaven: but the word is very nigh unto\nthee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.”(723) If\nthese expressions be understood merely of the precepts, I grant that they\nhave much weight in the present argument. For although we might easily\nelude their force, by saying that they treat of the facility and\npromptitude, not of observance, but of knowledge, yet still perhaps they\nmight leave some doubt. But the Apostle, in whose expositions there is no\nambiguity, removes all our doubts, by affirming that Moses here spake of\nthe doctrine of the gospel.(724) But if any one should obstinately\ncontend, that Paul has violently perverted the passage from its genuine\nmeaning, by applying it to the gospel, although his presumption could not\nbe acquitted of impiety, yet there is enough to refute him, independently\nof the authority of the Apostle. For, if Moses spoke only of the precepts,\nhe was deceiving the people with the vainest confidence. For would they\nnot have precipitated themselves into ruin, if they had attempted the\nobservance of the law in their own strength, as a thing of no difficulty?\nWhat, then, becomes of the very obvious facility with which the law may be\nobserved, when there appears no access to it but over a fatal precipice?\nWherefore nothing is more certain, than that Moses in these words\ncomprehended the covenant of mercy, which he had promulgated together with\nthe precepts of the law. For in a preceding verse he had taught that our\nhearts must be circumcised by God, in order that we may love him.(725)\nTherefore he placed this facility, of which he afterwards speaks, not in\nthe strength of man, but in the assistance and protection of the Holy\nSpirit, who powerfully accomplishes his work in our infirmity. However,\nthe passage is not to be understood simply of the precepts, but rather of\nthe promises of the gospel, which are so far from maintaining an ability\nin us to obtain righteousness, that they prove us to be utterly destitute\nof it. Paul, considering the same, proves by this testimony that salvation\nis proposed to us in the gospel, not under that hard, difficult, and\nimpossible condition, prescribed to us in the law, which pronounces it\nattainable only by those who have fulfilled all the commandments, but\nunder a condition easily and readily to be performed. Therefore this\ntestimony contributes nothing to support the liberty of the human will.\nXIII. Some other passages also are frequently objected, which show that\nGod sometimes tries men by withdrawing the assistance of his grace, and\nwaits to see what course they will pursue; as in Hosea: “I will go and\nreturn to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my\nface.”(726) It would be ridiculous, they say, for the Lord to consider,\nwhether Israel would seek his face, unless their minds were flexible,\ncapable of inclining either way, according to their own pleasure; as if it\nwere not very common for God, in the Prophets, to represent himself as\ndespising and rejecting his people, till they should amend their lives.\nBut what will our adversaries infer from such threats? If they maintain,\nthat those who are deserted by God, are capable of converting themselves,\nthey oppose the uniform declarations of Scripture. If they acknowledge\nthat the grace of God is necessary to conversion, what is their\ncontroversy with us? But they will reply, that they concede its necessity\nin such a sense as to maintain that man still retains some power. How do\nthey prove it? Certainly not from this or any similar passages. For it is\none thing to depart from a man, to observe what he will do when forsaken\nand left to himself, and another to assist his little strength in\nproportion to his imbecility. What, then, it will be inquired, is implied\nin such forms of expression? I reply, that the import of them is just as\nif God had said, Since admonitions, exhortations, and reproofs, produce no\ngood effect on this rebellious people, I will withdraw myself for a little\nwhile, and silently leave them to affliction. I will see whether, at some\nfuture period, after a series of calamities, they will remember me, and\nseek my face. The departure of the Lord signifies the removal of his word.\nHis observing what men will do, signifies his concealing himself in\nsilence, and exercising them for a season with various afflictions. He\ndoes both to humble us the more; for we should sooner be confounded than\ncorrected with the scourges of adversity, unless he rendered us docile by\nhis Spirit. Now, when the Lord, offended, and, as it were, wearied by our\nextreme obstinacy, leaves us for a time, by the removal of his word, in\nwhich he is accustomed to manifest his presence with us, and makes the\nexperiment, what we shall do in his absence,—it is falsely inferred from\nthis, that there is some power of free will, which he observes and proves;\nsince he acts in this manner with no other design than to bring us to a\nsense and acknowledgment of our own nothingness.\nXIV. They argue also from the manner of expression which is invariably\nobserved, both in the Scripture and in the common conversation of mankind.\nFor good actions are called our own, and we are said to perform what is\nholy and pleasing to the Lord, as well as to commit sins. But if sins be\njustly imputed to us, as proceeding from ourselves, certainly some share\nought to be, for the same reason, assigned to us also in works of\nrighteousness. For it would be absurd that we should be said to do those\nthings, to the performance of which, being incapable of any exertion of\nour own, we were impelled by God, as so many stones. Wherefore, though we\nallow the grace of God the preëminence, yet these expressions indicate\nthat our own endeavours hold at least the second place. If it were only\nalleged, that good works are called our own, I would reply, that the bread\nwhich we pray to God to give us, is called ours. What will they prove by\nthis term, but that what otherwise by no means belongs to us, becomes ours\nthrough the benignity and gratuitous munificence of God? Therefore let\nthem either ridicule the same absurdity in the Lord’s prayer, or no longer\nesteem it ridiculous, that good works are denominated ours, in which we\nhave no propriety but from the liberality of God. But there is rather more\nforce in what follows; that the Scripture frequently affirms that we\nourselves worship God, work righteousness, obey the law, and perform good\nworks. These being the proper offices of the understanding and will, how\ncould they justly be referred to the Spirit, and at the same time be\nattributed to us, if there were not some union of our exertions with the\ngrace of God? We shall easily extricate ourselves from these objections,\nif we properly consider the manner in which the Spirit of the Lord\noperates in the saints. The similitude with which they try to cast an\nodium on our sentiments, is quite foreign to the subject; for who is so\nsenseless as to suppose that there is no difference between impelling a\nman, and throwing a stone? Nor does any such consequence follow from our\ndoctrine. We rank among the natural powers of man, approving, rejecting;\nwilling, nilling; attempting, resisting; that is, a power to approve\nvanity, and to reject true excellence; to will what is evil, to refuse\nwhat is good; to attempt iniquity, and to resist righteousness. What\nconcern has the Lord in this? If it be his will to use this depravity as\nan instrument of his wrath, he directs and appoints it according to his\npleasure, in order to execute his good work by means of a wicked hand.\nShall we, then, compare a wicked man who is thus subservient to the Divine\npower, while he only studies to gratify his own corrupt inclination, to a\nstone which is hurled by an extrinsic impulse, and driven along without\nany motion, sense, or will of its own? We perceive what a vast difference\nthere is. But how does the Lord operate in good men, to whom the question\nprincipally relates? When he erects his kingdom within them, he by his\nSpirit restrains their will, that it may not be hurried away by unsteady\nand violent passions, according to the propensity of nature; that it may\nbe inclined to holiness and righteousness, he bends, composes, forms, and\ndirects it according to the rule of his own righteousness; that it may not\nstagger or fall, he establishes and confirms it by the power of his\nSpirit. For which reason Augustine says, “You will reply to me, Then we\nare actuated; we do not act. Yes, you both act and are actuated; and you\nact well, when you are actuated by that which is good. The Spirit of God,\nwho actuates you, assists those who act, and calls himself a helper,\nbecause you also perform something.” In the first clause he inculcates\nthat the agency of man is not destroyed by the influence of the Spirit;\nbecause the will, which is guided to aspire to what is good, belongs to\nhis nature. But the inference which he immediately subjoins, from the term\n_help_, that we also perform something, we should not understand in such a\nsense, as though he attributed any thing to us independently; but in order\nto avoid encouraging us in indolence, he reconciles the Divine agency with\nours in this way; that to will is from nature, to will what is good is\nfrom grace. Therefore he had just before said, “Without the assistance of\nGod, we shall be not only unable to conquer, but even to contend.”\nXV. Hence it appears that the grace of God, in the sense in which this\nword is used when we treat of regeneration, is the rule of the Spirit for\ndirecting and governing the human will. He cannot govern it unless he\ncorrect, reform, and renovate it; whence we say that the commencement of\nregeneration is an abolition of what is from ourselves; nor unless he also\nexcite, actuate, impel, support, and restrain it; whence we truly assert,\nthat all the actions which proceed from this are entirely of the Spirit.\nAt the same time, we fully admit the truth of what Augustine teaches, that\nthe will is not destroyed by grace, but rather repaired; for these two\nthings are perfectly consistent—that the human will may be said to be\nrepaired, when, by the correction of its depravity and perverseness, it is\ndirected according to the true standard of righteousness; and also that a\nnew will may be said to be created in man, because the natural will is so\nvitiated and corrupted, that it needs to be formed entirely anew. Now,\nthere is no reason why we may not justly be said to perform that which the\nSpirit of God performs in us, although our own will contributes nothing of\nitself, independently of his grace. And, therefore, we should remember\nwhat we have before cited from Augustine, that many persons labour in vain\nto find in the human will some good, properly its own. For whatever\nmixture men study to add from the power of free will to the grace of God,\nis only a corruption of it; just as if any one should dilute good wine\nwith dirty or bitter water. But although whatever good there is in the\nhuman will, proceeds wholly from the internal influence of the Spirit, yet\nbecause we have a natural faculty of willing, we are, not without reason,\nsaid to do those things, the praise of which God justly claims to himself;\nfirst, because whatever God does in us, becomes ours by his benignity,\nprovided we do not apprehend it to originate from ourselves; secondly,\nbecause the understanding is ours, the will is ours, and the effort is\nours, which are all directed by him to that which is good.\nXVI. The other testimonies, which they rake together from every quarter,\nwill not much embarrass even persons of moderate capacities, who have well\ndigested the answers already given. They quote this passage from Genesis:\n“Unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him;”(727) or, as\nthey would translate the words, “Subject to thee shall be its appetite,\nand thou shalt rule over it;” which they explain to relate to sin, as\nthough the Lord promised Cain, that the power of sin should not obtain\ndominion over his mind, if he would labour to overcome it. But we say that\nit is more agreeable to the tenor of the context, to understand it to be\nspoken concerning Abel. For the design of God in it is to prove the\niniquity of that envy, which Cain had conceived against his brother. This\nhe does by two reasons: first, that it was in vain for him to meditate\ncrimes in order to excel his brother in the sight of God, with whom no\nhonour is given but to righteousness; secondly, that he was extremely\nungrateful for the favours God had already conferred on him, since he\ncould not bear his brother, even though subject to his authority. But that\nwe may not appear to adopt this explanation, merely because the other is\nunfavourable to our tenets, let us admit that God spake concerning sin. If\nit be so, then what the Lord there declares, is either promised or\ncommanded by him. If it be a command, we have already demonstrated that it\naffords no proof of the power of men: if it be a promise, where is the\ncompletion of the promise, seeing that Cain fell under the dominion of\nsin, over which he ought to have prevailed? They will say, that the\npromise includes a tacit condition, as though it had been declared to him\nthat he should obtain the victory if he would contend for it; but who can\nadmit these subterfuges? For if this dominion be referred to sin, the\nspeech is doubtless a command, expressive, not of our ability, but of our\nduty, which remains our duty even though it exceed our ability. But the\nsubject itself, and grammatical propriety, require a comparison to be made\nbetween Cain and Abel; in which the elder brother would not have been\nplaced below the younger, if he had not degraded himself by his own\nwickedness.\nXVII. They adduce also the testimony of the Apostle, who says, that “it is\nnot of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth\nmercy;”(728) whence they conclude, that there is something in the will and\nendeavour, which, though ineffectual of itself, is rendered successful by\nthe assistance of the Divine mercy. But if they would soberly examine the\nsubject there treated by Paul, they would not so inconsiderately pervert\nthis passage. I know that they can allege the suffrages of Origen and\nJerome in defence of their exposition; and in opposition to them, I could\nproduce that of Augustine. But their opinions are of no importance to us\nif we can ascertain what was the meaning of Paul. He is there teaching,\nthat salvation is provided for them alone, whom the Lord favours with his\nmercy; but that ruin and perdition await all those whom he has not chosen.\nHe had shown, by the example of Pharaoh, the condition of the reprobate;\nand had confirmed the certainty of gratuitous election by the testimony of\nMoses: “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.” His conclusion is,\nthat “it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God\nthat showeth mercy.” If this be understood to imply that our will and\nendeavour are not sufficient, because they are not equal to so great a\nwork, Paul has expressed himself with great impropriety. Away, therefore,\nwith these sophisms: “It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that\nrunneth;” therefore there is some willing and some running. For the\nmeaning of Paul is more simple—It is neither our willing nor our running,\nwhich procures for us a way of salvation, but solely the mercy of God. For\nhe expresses here the same sentiment as he does to Titus, when he says,\n“that the kindness and love of God towards man appeared, not by works of\nrighteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy.”(729) The\nvery persons, who argue that Paul, in denying that it is of him that\nwilleth or of him that runneth, implies that there is some willing and\nsome running, would not allow me to use the same mode of reasoning, that\nwe have done some good works, because Paul denies that we have obtained\nthe favour of God by any works which we have done. But if they perceive a\nflaw in this argumentation, let them open their eyes, and they will\nperceive a similar fallacy in their own. For the argument on which\nAugustine rests the dispute is unanswerable: “If it be said, that it is\nnot of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, merely because neither\nour willing nor our running is sufficient, it may, on the contrary, be\nretorted, that it is not of the mercy of God, because that does not act\nalone.”(730) The latter position being absurd, Augustine justly concludes\nthe meaning of this passage to be, that there is no good will in man,\nunless it be prepared by the Lord; not but that we ought to will and to\nrun, but because God works in us both the one and the other. With similar\nwant of judgment, some pervert this declaration of Paul, “We are labourers\ntogether with God;”(731) which, without doubt, is restricted solely to\nministers, who are denominated “workers with him,” not that they\ncontribute any thing of themselves, but because God makes use of their\nagency, after he has qualified them and furnished them with the necessary\ntalents.\nXVIII. They produce a passage from Ecclesiasticus, which is well known to\nbe a book of doubtful authority. But though we should not reject it,\nwhich, nevertheless, if we chose, we might justly do, what testimony does\nit afford in support of free will? The writer says, that man, as soon as\nhe was created, was left in the power of his own will; that precepts were\ngiven to him, which if he kept, he should also be kept by them; that he\nhad life and death, good and evil, set before him; and that whatever he\ndesired, would be given him.(732) Let it be granted, that man at his\ncreation was endowed with a power of choosing life or death. What if we\nreply, that he has lost it? I certainly do not intend to contradict\nSolomon, who asserts that “God hath made man upright; but they have sought\nout many inventions.”(733) But man, by his degeneracy, having shipwrecked\nboth himself and all his excellences, whatever is attributed to his\nprimitive state, it does not immediately follow that it belongs to his\nvitiated and degenerated nature. Therefore I reply, not only to them, but\nalso to Ecclesiasticus himself, whoever he be: If you design to teach man\nto seek within himself a power to attain salvation, your authority is not\nso great in our estimation as to obtain even the smallest degree of\ncredit, in opposition to the undoubted word of God. But if you only aim to\nrepress the malignity of the flesh, which vainly attempts to vindicate\nitself by transferring its crimes to God, and you therefore reply, that\nman was originally endued with rectitude, from which it is evident that he\nwas the cause of his own ruin, I readily assent to it; provided we also\nagree in this, that through his own guilt he is now despoiled of those\nornaments with which God invested him at the beginning; and so unite in\nconfessing, that in his present situation he needs not an advocate, but a\nphysician.\nXIX. But there is nothing which our adversaries have more frequently in\ntheir mouths, than the parable of Christ concerning the traveller, who was\nleft by robbers in the road half dead.(734) I know it is the common\nopinion of almost all writers, that the calamity of the human race is\nrepresented under the type of this traveller. Hence they argue, that man\nis not so mutilated by the violence of sin and the devil, but that he\nstill retains some relics of his former excellences, since he is said to\nhave been left only half dead; for what becomes of the remaining portion\nof life, unless there remain some rectitude both of reason and will? In\nthe first place, what could they say, if I refused to admit their\nallegory? For there is no doubt but that this interpretation, invented by\nthe fathers, is foreign to the genuine sense of our Lord’s discourse.\nAllegories ought to be extended no further than they are supported by the\nauthority of Scripture; for they are far from affording of themselves a\nsufficient foundation for any doctrines. Nor is there any want of\narguments by which, if I chose, I could completely confute this erroneous\nnotion; for the word of God does not leave man in the possession of a\nproportion of life, but teaches, that as far as respects happiness of\nlife, he is wholly dead. Paul, when speaking of our redemption, says, not\nthat we were recovered when half dead, but that “even when we were dead,\nwe were raised up.” He calls not on the half dead, but on those who are in\nthe grave, sleeping the sleep of death, to receive the illumination of\nChrist.(735) And the Lord himself speaks in a similar manner, when he\nsays, that “the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the\nvoice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.”(736) With what\nface can they oppose a slight allusion against so many positive\nexpressions? Yet let this allegory even be admitted as a clear testimony;\nwhat will it enable them to extort from us? Man, they will say, is but\nhalf dead; therefore he has some faculty remaining entire. I grant that he\nhas a mind capable of understanding, though it attains not to heavenly and\nspiritual wisdom; he has some idea of virtue; he has some sense of the\nDeity, though he acquires not the true knowledge of God. But what is to be\nconcluded from all this? It certainly does not disprove the assertion of\nAugustine, which has received the general approbation even of the schools,\nthat man, since his fall, has been deprived of the gifts of grace on which\nsalvation depends; but that the natural ones are corrupted and polluted.\nLet us hold this, then, as an undoubted truth, which no opposition can\never shake—that the mind of man is so completely alienated from the\nrighteousness of God, that it conceives, desires, and undertakes every\nthing that is impious, perverse, base, impure, and flagitious; that his\nheart is so thoroughly infected by the poison of sin, that it cannot\nproduce any thing but what is corrupt; and that if at any time men do any\nthing apparently good, yet the mind always remains involved in hypocrisy\nand fallacious obliquity, and the heart enslaved by its inward\nperverseness."

          "title": "Chapter VI. Redemption For Lost Man To Be Sought In Christ.",
          "content": "The whole human race having perished in the person of Adam, our original\nexcellence and dignity, which we have noticed, so far from being\nadvantageous to us, only involves us in greater ignominy, till God, who\ndoes not acknowledge the pollution and corruption of man by sin to be his\nwork, appears as a Redeemer in the person of his only begotten Son.\nTherefore, since we are fallen from life into death, all that knowledge of\nGod as a Creator, of which we have been treating, would be useless, unless\nit were succeeded by faith exhibiting God to us as a Father in Christ.\nThis, indeed, was the genuine order of nature, that the fabric of the\nworld should be a school in which we might learn piety, and thence be\nconducted to eternal life and perfect felicity. But since the fall,\nwhithersoever we turn our eyes, the curse of God meets us on every side,\nwhich, whilst it seizes innocent creatures and involves them in our guilt,\nmust necessarily overwhelm our souls with despair. For though God is\npleased still to manifest his paternal kindness to us in various ways, yet\nwe cannot, from a contemplation of the world, conclude that he is our\nFather, when our conscience disturbs us within, and convinces us that our\nsins afford a just reason why God should abandon us, and no longer esteem\nus as his children. We are also chargeable with stupidity and ingratitude;\nfor our minds, being blinded, do not perceive the truth; and all our\nsenses being corrupted, we wickedly defraud God of his glory. We must\ntherefore subscribe to the declaration of Paul: “For after that in the\nwisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the\nfoolishness of preaching to save them that believe.”(737) What he\ndenominates the wisdom of God, is this magnificent theatre of heaven and\nearth, which is replete with innumerable miracles, and from the\ncontemplation of which we ought wisely to acquire the knowledge of God.\nBut because we have made so little improvement in this way, he recalls us\nto the faith of Christ, which is despised by unbelievers on account of its\napparent folly. Wherefore, though the preaching of the cross is not\nagreeable to human reason, we ought, nevertheless, to embrace it with all\nhumility, if we desire to return to God our Creator, from whom we have\nbeen alienated, and to have him reassume the character of our Father.\nSince the fall of the first man, no knowledge of God, without the\nMediator, has been available to salvation. For Christ speaks not of his\nown time only, but comprehends all ages, when he says that “this is life\neternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast\nsent.”(738) And this aggravates the stupidity of those who set open the\ngate of heaven to all unbelievers and profane persons, without the grace\nof Christ, whom the Scripture universally represents as the only door of\nentrance into salvation. But if any man would restrict this declaration of\nChrist to the period of the first promulgation of the gospel, we are\nprepared with a refutation. For it has been a common opinion, in all ages\nand nations, that those who are alienated from God, and pronounced\naccursed, and children of wrath, cannot please him without a\nreconciliation. Here add the answer of Christ to the woman of Samaria: “Ye\nworship ye know not what: we know what we worship; for salvation is of the\nJews.”(739) In these words he at once condemns all the religions of the\nGentiles as false, and assigns a reason for it; because under the law the\nRedeemer was promised only to the chosen people; whence it follows that no\nworship has ever been acceptable to God, unless it had respect to Christ.\nHence also Paul affirms that all the Gentiles were without God, and\ndestitute of the hope of life.(740) Now, as John teaches us that life was\nfrom the beginning in Christ, and that the whole world are fallen from\nit,(741) it is necessary to return to that fountain; and therefore Christ\nasserts himself to be the life, as he is the author of the propitiation.\nAnd, indeed, the celestial inheritance belongs exclusively to the children\nof God. But it is very unreasonable that they should be considered in the\nplace and order of his children, who have not been engrafted into the body\nof his only begotten Son. And John plainly declares that “they who believe\nin his name become the sons of God.”(742) But as it is not my design in\nthis place to treat professedly of faith in Christ, these cursory hints\nshall at present suffice.\nII. Therefore God never showed himself propitious to his ancient people,\nnor afforded them any hope of his favour, without a Mediator. I forbear to\nspeak of the legal sacrifices, by which the faithful were plainly and\npublicly instructed that salvation was to be sought solely in that\nexpiation, which has been accomplished by Christ alone. I only assert,\nthat the happiness of the Church has always been founded on the person of\nChrist. For though God comprehended in his covenant all the posterity of\nAbraham, yet Paul judiciously reasons, that Christ is in reality that Seed\nin whom all the nations were to be blessed;(743) since we know that the\nnatural descendants of that patriarch were not reckoned as his seed. For,\nto say nothing of Ishmael and others, what was the cause, that of the two\nsons of Isaac, the twin‐brothers Esau and Jacob, even when they were yet\nunborn, one should be chosen and the other rejected? How came it to pass\nthat the first‐born was rejected, and that the younger obtained his\nbirthright? How came the majority of the people to be disinherited? It is\nevident, therefore, that the seed of Abraham is reckoned principally in\none person, and that the promised salvation was not manifested till the\ncoming of Christ, whose office it is to collect what had been scattered\nabroad. The first adoption, therefore, of the chosen people, depended on\nthe grace of the Mediator; which, though it is not so plainly expressed by\nMoses, yet appears to have been generally well known to all the pious. For\nbefore the appointment of any king in the nation, Hannah, the mother of\nSamuel, speaking of the felicity of the faithful, thus expressed herself\nin her song: “The Lord shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the\nhorn of his anointed.”(744) Her meaning in these words is, that God will\nbless his Church. And to this agrees the oracle, which is soon after\nintroduced: “I will raise me up a faithful priest, and he shall walk\nbefore mine anointed.” And there is no doubt that it was the design of the\nheavenly Father to exhibit in David and his posterity a lively image of\nChrist. With a design to exhort the pious, therefore, to the fear of God,\nhe enjoins them to “kiss the Son;”(745) which agrees with this declaration\nof the gospel: “He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the\nFather.”(746) Therefore, though the kingdom was weakened by the revolt of\nthe ten tribes, yet the covenant, which God had made with David and his\nsuccessors, could not but stand, as he also declared by the Prophets: “I\nwill not rend away all the kingdom, but will give one tribe to thy son,\nfor David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have\nchosen.”(747) This is repeated again and again. It is also expressly\nadded, “I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.”(748)\nAt a little distance of time it is said, “For David’s sake did the Lord\nhis God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to\nestablish Jerusalem.”(749) Even when the state was come to the verge of\nruin, it was again said, “The Lord would not destroy Judah, for David his\nservant’s sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his\nchildren.”(750) The sum of the whole is this—that David alone was chosen,\nto the rejection of all others, as the perpetual object of the Divine\nfavour; as it is said, in another place, “He forsook the tabernacle of\nShiloh; he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of\nEphraim; but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion, which he loved. He\nchose David also his servant, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his\ninheritance.”(751) Finally, it pleased God to preserve his Church in such\na way, that its security and salvation should depend on that head. David\ntherefore exclaims, “The Lord is their strength, and he is the saving\nstrength of his anointed;”(752) and immediately adds this petition: “Save\nthy people, and bless thine inheritance;” signifying that the state of the\nChurch is inseparably connected with the government of Christ. In the same\nsense he elsewhere says, “Save, Lord; let the king hear us when we\ncall.”(753) In these words he clearly teaches us that the faithful resort\nto God for assistance, with no other confidence than because they are\nsheltered under the protection of the king. This is to be inferred from\nanother psalm: “Save, O Lord! Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the\nLord;”(754) where it is sufficiently evident that the faithful are invited\nto Christ, that they may hope to be saved by the power of God. The same\nthing is alluded to in another prayer, where the whole Church implores the\nmercy of God: “Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the\nSon of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.”(755) For though the\nauthor of the psalm deplores the dissipation of all the people, yet he\nardently prays for their restoration in their head alone. But when\nJeremiah, after the people were driven into exile, the land laid waste,\nand all things apparently ruined, bewails the miseries of the Church, he\nprincipally laments that by the subversion of the kingdom, the hope of the\nfaithful was cut off. “The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the\nLord, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall\nlive among the heathen.”(756) Hence it is sufficiently evident, that since\nGod cannot be propitious to mankind but through the Mediator, Christ was\nalways exhibited to the holy fathers under the law, as the object to which\nthey should direct their faith.\nIII. Now, when consolation is promised in affliction, but especially when\nthe deliverance of the Church is described, the standard of confidence and\nhope is erected in Christ alone. “Thou wentest forth for the salvation of\nthy people, even for salvation with thine anointed,”(757) says Habakkuk.\nAnd whenever the Prophets mention the restoration of the Church, they\nrecall the people to the promise given to David concerning the perpetuity\nof his kingdom. Nor is this to be wondered at; for otherwise there would\nbe no stability in the covenant. To this refers the memorable answer of\nIsaiah. For when he saw that his declaration concerning the raising of the\nsiege, and the present deliverance of Jerusalem, was rejected by that\nunbelieving king, Ahaz, he makes rather an abrupt transition to the\nMessiah: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son;”(758)\nindirectly suggesting, that although the king and the people, in their\nperverseness, rejected the promise which had been given them, as though\nthey would purposely labour to invalidate the truth of God, yet that his\ncovenant would not be frustrated, but that the Redeemer should come at his\nappointed time. Finally, all the Prophets, in order to display the Divine\nmercy, were constantly careful to exhibit to view that kingdom of David,\nfrom which redemption and eternal salvation were to proceed. Thus Isaiah:\n“I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of\nDavid. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people;”(759) because\nin desperate circumstances the faithful could have no hope, any otherwise\nthan by his interposition as a witness, that God would be merciful to\nthem. Thus also Jeremiah, to comfort them who were in despair, says,\n“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a\nrighteous Branch. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell\nsafely.”(760) And Ezekiel: “I will set up one Shepherd over them, and he\nshall feed them, even my servant David. And I the Lord will be their God,\nand my servant David a prince among them; and I will make with them a\ncovenant of peace.”(761) Again, in another place, having treated of their\nincredible renovation, he says, “David my servant shall be king over them;\nand they all shall have one Shepherd. Moreover I will make a covenant of\npeace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them.”(762) I\nselect a few passages out of many, because I only wish to apprize the\nreader, that the hope of the pious has never been placed any where but in\nChrist. All the other Prophets also uniformly speak the same language. As\nHosea: “Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be\ngathered together, and appoint themselves one head.”(763) And in a\nsubsequent chapter he is still more explicit: “The children of Israel\nshall return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king.”(764)\nMicah also, discoursing on the return of the people, expressly declares,\n“their king shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of\nthem.”(765) Thus Amos, intending to predict the restoration of the people,\nsays, “In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen,\nand close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins.”(766)\nThis implies that the only standard of salvation was the restoration of\nthe regal dignity in the family of David, which was accomplished in\nChrist. Zechariah, therefore, living nearer to the time of the\nmanifestation of Christ, more openly exclaims, “Rejoice greatly, O\ndaughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh\nunto thee: he is just, and having salvation.”(767) This corresponds with a\npassage from a psalm, already cited: “The Lord is the saving strength of\nhis anointed. Save thy people;”(768) where salvation is extended from the\nhead to the whole body.\nIV. It was the will of God that the Jews should be instructed by these\nprophecies, so that they might direct their eyes to Christ whenever they\nwanted deliverance. Nor, indeed, notwithstanding their shameful\ndegeneracy, could the memory of this general principle ever be\nobliterated—that God would be the deliverer of the Church by the hand of\nChrist, according to his promise to David; and that in this manner the\ncovenant of grace, in which God had adopted his elect, would at length be\nconfirmed. Hence it came to pass, that when Christ, a little before his\ndeath, entered into Jerusalem, that song was heard from the mouths of\nchildren, “Hosanna to the Son of David.”(769) For the subject of their\nsong appears to have been derived from a sentiment generally received and\navowed by the people, that there remained to them no other pledge of the\nmercy of God, but in the advent of the Redeemer. For this reason Christ\ncommands his disciples to believe in him, that they may distinctly and\nperfectly believe in God: “Ye believe in God, believe also in me.”(770)\nFor though, strictly speaking, faith ascends from Christ to the Father,\nyet he suggests, that though it were even fixed on God, yet it would\ngradually decline, unless he interposed, to preserve its stability. The\nmajesty of God is otherwise far above the reach of mortals, who are like\nworms crawling upon the earth. Wherefore, though I do not reject that\ncommon observation that God is the object of faith, yet I consider it as\nrequiring some correction. For it is not without reason that Christ is\ncalled “the image of the invisible God;”(771) but by this appellation we\nare reminded, that unless God reveal himself to us in Christ, we cannot\nhave that knowledge of him which is necessary to salvation. For although\namong the Jews the scribes had by false glosses obscured the declarations\nof the Prophets concerning the Redeemer, yet Christ assumed it for\ngranted, as if allowed by common consent, that there was no other remedy\nfor the confusion into which the Jews had fallen, nor any other mode of\ndeliverance for the Church, but the exhibition of the Mediator. There was\nnot, indeed, such a general knowledge as there ought to have been, of the\nprinciple taught by Paul, that “Christ is the end of the law;”(772) but\nthe truth and certainty of this evidently appears both from the law itself\nand from the Prophets. I am not yet treating of faith; there will be a\nmore suitable place for that subject in another part of the work. Only let\nthis be well fixed in the mind of the reader; that the first step to piety\nis to know that God is our Father, to protect, govern, and support us till\nhe gathers us into the eternal inheritance of his kingdom; that hence it\nis plain, as we have before asserted, that there can be no saving\nknowledge of God without Christ; and consequently that from the beginning\nof the world he has always been manifested to all the elect, that they\nmight look to him, and repose all their confidence in him. In this sense\nIrenæus says that the Father, who is infinite in himself, becomes finite\nin the Son; because he has accommodated himself to our capacity, that he\nmay not overwhelm our minds with the infinity of his glory.(773) And\nfanatics, not considering this, pervert a useful observation into an\nimpious reverie, as though there were in Christ merely a portion of Deity,\nan emanation from the infinite perfection; whereas the sole meaning of\nthat writer is, that God is apprehended in Christ, and in him alone. The\nassertion of John has been verified in all ages, “Whosoever denieth the\nSon, the same hath not the Father.”(774) For though many in ancient times\ngloried in being worshippers of the Supreme Deity, the Creator of heaven\nand earth, yet, because they had no Mediator, it was impossible for them\nto have any real acquaintance with the mercy of God, or persuasion that he\nwas their Father. Therefore, as they did not hold the head, that is,\nChrist, all their knowledge of God was obscure and unsettled; whence it\ncame to pass, that degenerating at length into gross and vile\nsuperstitions, they betrayed their ignorance, like the Turks in modern\ntimes; who, though they boast of having the Creator of heaven and earth\nfor their God, yet only substitute an idol instead of the true God as long\nas they remain enemies to Christ."

          "title": "Chapter VII. The Law Given, Not To Confine The Ancient People To Itself,",
          "content": "But To Encourage Their Hope Of Salvation In Christ, Till The Time Of His\nComing.\nFrom the deduction we have made, it may easily be inferred, that the law\nwas superadded about four hundred years after the death of Abraham, not to\ndraw away the attention of the chosen people from Christ, but rather to\nkeep their minds waiting for his advent, to inflame their desires and\nconfirm their expectations, that they might not be discouraged by so long\na delay. By the word _law_, I intend, not only the decalogue, which\nprescribes the rule of a pious and righteous life, but the form of\nreligion delivered from God by the hands of Moses. For Moses was not made\na legislator to abolish the blessing promised to the seed of Abraham; on\nthe contrary, we see him on every occasion reminding the Jews of that\ngracious covenant made with their fathers, to which they were heirs; as\nthough the object of his mission had been to renew it. It was very clearly\nmanifested in the ceremonies. For what could be more vain or frivolous\nthan for men to offer the fetid stench arising from the fat of cattle, in\norder to reconcile themselves to God? or to resort to any aspersion of\nwater or of blood, to cleanse themselves from pollution? In short, the\nwhole legal worship, if it be considered in itself, and contain no shadows\nand figures of correspondent truths, will appear perfectly ridiculous.\nWherefore it is not without reason, that both in the speech of Stephen and\nin the Epistle to the Hebrews, that passage is so carefully stated, in\nwhich God commands Moses to make all things pertaining to the tabernacle\n“according to the pattern showed to him in the mount.”(775) For unless\nthere had been some spiritual design, to which they were directed, the\nJews would have laboured to no purpose in these observances, as the\nGentiles did in their mummeries. Profane men, who have never seriously\ndevoted themselves to the pursuit of piety, have not patience to hear of\nsuch various rites: they not only wonder why God should weary his ancient\npeople with such a mass of ceremonies, but they even despise and deride\nthem as puerile and ludicrous. This arises from inattention to the end of\nthe legal figures, from which if those figures be separated, they must be\ncondemned as vain and useless. But the “pattern,” which is mentioned,\nshows that God commanded the sacrifices, not with a design to occupy his\nworshippers in terrestrial exercises, but rather that he might elevate\ntheir minds to sublimer objects. This may be likewise evinced by his\nnature; for as he is a Spirit, he is pleased with none but spiritual\nworship. Testimonies of this truth may be found in the numerous passages\nof the Prophets, in which they reprove the stupidity of the Jews for\nsupposing that sacrifices possess any real value in the sight of God. Do\nthey mean to derogate from the law? Not at all; but being true\ninterpreters of it, they designed by this method to direct the eyes of the\npeople to that point from which the multitude were wandering. Now, from\nthe grace offered to the Jews, it is inferred as a certain truth, that the\nlaw was not irrespective of Christ; for Moses mentioned to them this end\nof their adoption, that they might “be unto God a kingdom of\npriests;”(776) which could not be attained without a greater and more\nexcellent reconciliation than could arise from the blood of beasts. For\nwhat is more improbable than that the sons of Adam, who by hereditary\ncontagion are all born the slaves of sin, should be exalted to regal\ndignity, and thus become partakers of the glory of God, unless such an\neminent blessing proceeded from some other source than themselves? How\nalso could the right of the priesthood remain among them, the pollution of\nwhose crimes rendered them abominable to God, unless they had been\nconsecrated in a holy head? Wherefore Peter makes a beautiful application\nof this observation of Moses, suggesting that the plenitude of that grace,\nof which the Jews enjoyed a taste under the law, is exhibited in Christ.\n“Ye are,” says he, “a chosen generation, a royal priesthood.”(777) This\napplication of the words tends to show, that they, to whom Christ has\nappeared under the gospel, have obtained more than their forefathers;\nbecause they are all invested with sacerdotal and regal honours, that in a\ndependence on their Mediator they may venture to come boldly into the\npresence of God.\nII. And here it must be remarked, by the way, that the kingdom, which at\nlength was erected in the family of David, is a part of the law, and\ncomprised under the ministry of Moses; whence it follows, that both in the\nposterity of David, and in the whole Levitical tribe, as in a twofold\nmirror, Christ was exhibited to the view of his ancient people. For, as I\nhave just observed, it was otherwise impossible that in the Divine view\nthey should be kings and priests, who were the slaves of sin and death,\nand polluted by their own corruptions. Hence appears the truth of the\nassertion of Paul, that the Jews were subject, as it were, to the\nauthority of a schoolmaster, till the advent of that seed, for whose sake\nthe promise was given.(778) For Christ being not yet familiarly\ndiscovered, they were like children, whose imbecility could not yet bear\nthe full knowledge of heavenly things. But how they were led to Christ by\nthe ceremonies, has been already stated, and may be better learned from\nthe testimonies of the Prophets. For although they were obliged every day\nto approach God with new sacrifices, in order to appease him, yet Isaiah\npromises them the expiation of all their transgressions by a single\nsacrifice,(779) which is confirmed by Daniel.(780) The priests chosen from\nthe tribe of Levi, used to enter into the sanctuary; but concerning that\none priest it was once said, that he was divinely chosen with an oath, to\nbe “a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.”(781) There was,\nthen, an unction of visible oil; but Daniel, from his vision, foretells an\nunction of a different kind. But not to insist on many proofs, the author\nof the Epistle to the Hebrews, from the fourth chapter to the eleventh,\ndemonstrates in a manner sufficiently copious and clear, that,\nirrespective of Christ, all the ceremonies of the law are worthless and\nvain. And in regard to the decalogue, we should attend to the declaration\nof Paul, that “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one\nthat believeth;”(782) and also that Christ is “the Spirit,” who gives\n“life” to the otherwise dead letter.(783) For in the former passage he\nsignifies that righteousness is taught in vain by the precepts, till\nChrist bestows it both by a gratuitous imputation, and by the Spirit of\nregeneration. Wherefore he justly denominates Christ the completion or end\nof the law; for we should derive no benefit from a knowledge of what God\nrequires of us, unless we were succoured by Christ when labouring and\noppressed under its yoke and intolerable burden. In another place, he\nstates that “the law was added because of transgressions;”(784) that is,\nto humble men, by convicting them of being the causes of their own\ncondemnation. Now, this being the true and only preparation for seeking\nChrist, the various declarations which he makes are in perfect unison with\neach other. But as he was then engaged in a controversy with erroneous\nteachers, who pretended that we merit righteousness by the works of the\nlaw,—in order to refute their error, he was sometimes obliged to use the\nterm _law_ in a more restricted sense, as merely preceptive, although it\nwas otherwise connected with the covenant of gratuitous adoption.\nIII. But it is worthy of a little inquiry, how we are rendered more\ninexcusable by the instructions of the moral law, in order that a sense of\nour guilt may excite us to supplicate for pardon. If it be true that the\nlaw displays a perfection of righteousness, it also follows that the\ncomplete observation of it, is in the sight of God a perfect\nrighteousness, in which a man would be esteemed and reputed righteous at\nthe tribunal of heaven. Wherefore Moses, when he had promulgated the law,\nhesitated not to “call heaven and earth to record”(785) that he had\nproposed to the Israelites life and death, good and evil. Nor can we deny\nthat the reward of eternal life awaits a righteous obedience to the law,\naccording to the Divine promise. But, on the other hand, it is proper to\nexamine whether we perform that obedience, the merit of which can warrant\nour confident expectation of that reward. For how unimportant is it, to\ndiscover that the reward of eternal life depends on the observance of the\nlaw, unless we also ascertain whether it be possible for us to arrive at\neternal life in that way! But in this point the weakness of the law is\nmanifest. For as none of us are found to observe the law, we are excluded\nfrom the promises of life, and fall entirely under the curse. I am now\nshowing, not only what does happen, but what necessarily must happen. For\nthe doctrine of the law being far above human ability, man may view the\npromises, indeed, from a distance, but cannot gather any fruit from them.\nIt only remains for him, from their goodness to form a truer estimate of\nhis own misery, while he reflects that all hope of salvation is cut off,\nand that he is in imminent danger of death. On the other hand, we are\nurged with terrible sanctions, which bind, not a few of us, but every\nindividual of mankind; they urge, I say, and pursue us with inexorable\nrigour, so that in the law we see nothing but present death.\nIV. Therefore, if we direct our views exclusively to the law, the effects\nupon our minds will only be despondency, confusion, and despair, since it\ncondemns and curses us all, and keeps us far from that blessedness which\nit proposes to them who observe it. Does the Lord, then, you will say, in\nthis case do nothing but mock us? For how little does it differ from\nmockery, to exhibit a hope of felicity, to invite and exhort to it, to\ndeclare that it is ready for our reception, whilst the way to it is closed\nand inaccessible! I reply, although the promises of the law, being\nconditional, depend on a perfect obedience to the law, which can nowhere\nbe found, yet they have not been given in vain. For when we have learned\nthat they will be vain and inefficacious to us, unless God embrace us with\nhis gratuitous goodness, without any regard to our works, and unless we\nhave also embraced by faith that goodness, as exhibited to us in the\ngospel,—then these promises are not without their use, even with the\ncondition annexed to them. For then he gratuitously confers every thing\nupon us, so that he adds this also to the number of his favours, that not\nrejecting our imperfect obedience, but pardoning its deficiencies, he\ngives us to enjoy the benefit of the legal promises, just as if we had\nfulfilled the condition ourselves. But as we shall more fully discuss this\nquestion when we treat of the justification of faith, we shall pursue it\nno further at present.\nV. Our assertion, respecting the impossibility of observing the law, must\nbe briefly explained and proved; for it is generally esteemed a very\nabsurd sentiment, so that Jerome has not scrupled to denounce it as\naccursed. What was the opinion of Jerome, I regard not; let us inquire\nwhat is truth. I shall not here enter into a long discussion of the\nvarious species of possibility; I call that impossible which has never\nhappened yet, and which is prevented by the ordination and decree of God\nfrom ever happening in future. If we inquire from the remotest period of\nantiquity, I assert that there never has existed a saint, who, surrounded\nwith a body of death, could attain to such a degree of love, as to love\nGod with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his mind; and,\nmoreover, that there never has been one, who was not the subject of some\ninordinate desire. Who can deny this? I know, indeed, what sort of saints\nthe folly of superstition imagines to itself, such as almost excel even\nthe angels of heaven in purity; but such an imagination is repugnant both\nto Scripture and to the dictates of experience. I assert also that no man,\nwho shall exist in future, will reach the standard of true perfection,\nunless released from the burden of the body. This is established by clear\ntestimonies of Scripture: Solomon says, “There is not a just man upon\nearth, that doeth good and sinneth not.”(786) David; “In thy sight shall\nno man living be justified.”(787) Job in many passages affirms the same\nthing;(788) but Paul most plainly of all, that “the flesh lusteth against\nthe Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.”(789) Nor does he prove,\nthat “as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse,” by any\nother reason but because “it is written, Cursed is every one that\ncontinueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to\ndo them;”(790) evidently suggesting, and even taking it for granted, that\nno one can continue in them. Now, whatever is predicted in the Scriptures,\nmust be considered as perpetual, and even as necessary. With a similar\nfallacy Augustine used to be teased by the Pelagians, who maintained that\nit is an injury to God, to say that he commands more than the faithful\nthrough his grace are able to perform. To avoid their cavil, he admitted\nthat the Lord might, if he chose, exalt a mortal man to the purity of\nangels; but that he neither had ever done it, nor would ever do it,\nbecause he had declared otherwise in the Scriptures.(791) This I do not\ndeny; but I add that it is absurd to dispute concerning the power of God,\nin opposition to his veracity; and that, therefore, it affords no room for\ncavilling, when any one maintains that to be impossible, which the\nScriptures declare will never happen. But if the dispute be about the\nterm, the Lord, in reply to an inquiry of his disciples, “Who, then, can\nbe saved?” says, “With men this is impossible; but with God all things are\npossible.”(792) Augustine contends, with a very powerful argument, that in\nthis flesh we never render to God the legitimate love which we owe to him.\n“Love,” says he, “is an effect of knowledge, so that no man can perfectly\nlove God, who has not first a complete knowledge of his goodness. During\nour pilgrimage in this world, we see through an obscure medium; the\nconsequence of this, then, is, that our love is imperfect.” It ought,\ntherefore, to be admitted without controversy, that it is impossible in\nthis carnal state to fulfil the law, if we consider the impotence of our\nnature, as will elsewhere be proved also from Paul.(793)\nVI. But for the better elucidation of the subject, let us state, in a\ncompendious order, the office and use of what is called the moral law. It\nis contained, as far as I understand it, in these three points. The first\nis, that while it discovers the righteousness of God, that is, the only\nrighteousness which is acceptable to God, it warns every one of his own\nunrighteousness, places it beyond all doubt, convicts, and condemns him.\nFor it is necessary that man, blinded and inebriated with self‐love,\nshould thus be driven into a knowledge of himself, and a confession of his\nown imbecility and impurity. Since, unless his vanity be evidently\nreproved, he is inflated with a foolish confidence in his strength, and\ncan never be brought to perceive its feebleness as long as he measures it\nby the rule of his own fancy. But as soon as he begins to compare it to\nthe difficulty of the law, he finds his insolence and pride immediately\nabate. For how great soever his preconceived opinion of it, he perceives\nit immediately pant under so heavy a load, and then totter, and at length\nfall. Thus, being instructed under the tuition of the law, he lays aside\nthat arrogance with which he was previously blinded. He must also be cured\nof the other disease, of pride, with which, we have observed, he is\nafflicted. As long as he is permitted to stand in his own judgment, he\nsubstitutes hypocrisy instead of righteousness; contented with which, he\nrises up with I know not what pretended righteousnesses, in opposition to\nthe grace of God. But when he is constrained to examine his life according\nto the rules of the law, he no longer presumes on his counterfeit\nrighteousness, but perceives that he is at an infinite distance from\nholiness; and also that he abounds with innumerable vices, from which he\nbefore supposed himself to be pure. For the evils of concupiscence are\nconcealed in such deep and intricate recesses, as easily to elude the view\nof man. And it is not without cause that the Apostle says, “I had not\nknown lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet;”(794) because,\nunless it be stripped of its disguises, and brought to light by the law,\nit destroys the miserable man in so secret a manner, that he does not\nperceive its fatal dart.\nVII. Thus the law is like a mirror, in which we behold, first, our\nimpotence; secondly, our iniquity, which proceeds from it; and lastly, the\nconsequence of both, our obnoxiousness to the curse; just as a mirror\nrepresents to us the spots on our face. For when a man is destitute of\npower to practise righteousness, he must necessarily fall into the habits\nof sin. And sin is immediately followed by the curse. Therefore the\ngreater the transgression of which the law convicts us, the more severe is\nthe judgment with which it condemns us. This appears from the observation\nof the Apostle, that “by the law is the knowledge of sin.”(795) For he\nthere speaks only of the first office of the law, which is experienced in\nsinners not yet regenerated. The same sentiment is conveyed in the\nfollowing passages: that “the law entered, that the offence might\nabound;”(796) and that it is therefore “the ministration of death, which\nworketh wrath and slayeth.”(797) For iniquity undoubtedly increases more\nand more, in proportion to the clearness of that sense of sin which\nstrikes the conscience; because to transgression of the law, there is then\nadded contumacy against the lawgiver. It remains, therefore, that the law\narm the Divine wrath against the sinner; for of itself it can only accuse,\ncondemn, and destroy. And, as Augustine says, if we have not the Spirit of\ngrace, the law serves only to convict and slay us. But this assertion\nneither reflects dishonour on the law, nor at all derogates from its\nexcellence. Certainly, if our will were wholly conformed to the law, and\ndisposed to obey it, the mere knowledge of it would evidently be\nsufficient to salvation. But since our carnal and corrupt nature is in a\nstate of hostility against the spirituality of the Divine law, and not\namended by its discipline, it follows that the law, which was given for\nsalvation, if it could have found adequate attention, becomes an occasion\nof sin and death. For since we are all convicted of having transgressed\nit, the more clearly it displays the righteousness of God, so, on the\ncontrary, the more it detects our iniquity, and the more certainly it\nconfirms the reward of life and salvation reserved for the righteous, so\nmuch the more certain it makes the perdition of the wicked. These\nexpressions, therefore, are so far from being dishonourable to the law,\nthat they serve more illustriously to recommend the Divine goodness. For\nhence it really appears, that our iniquity and depravity prevent us from\nenjoying that blessed life which is revealed to all men in the law. Hence\nthe grace of God, which succours us without the assistance of the law, is\nrendered sweeter; and his mercy, which confers it on us, more amiable;\nfrom which we learn that he is never wearied with repeating his blessings\nand loading us with new favours.\nVIII. But though the iniquity and condemnation of us all are confirmed by\nthe testimony of the law, this is not done (at least if we properly profit\nby it) in order to make us sink into despair, and fall over the precipice\nof despondency. It is true that the wicked are thus confounded by it, but\nthis is occasioned by the obstinacy of their hearts. With the children of\nGod, its instructions must terminate in a different manner. The Apostle\nindeed declares that we are all condemned by the sentence of the law,\n“that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty\nbefore God.”(798) Yet the same Apostle elsewhere informs us, that “God\nhath concluded them all in unbelief,” not that he might destroy or suffer\nall to perish, but “that he might have mercy upon all;”(799) that is, that\nleaving their foolish opinion of their own strength, they may know that\nthey stand and are supported only by the power of God; that being naked\nand destitute, they may resort for assistance to his mercy, recline\nthemselves wholly upon it, hide themselves entirely in it, and embrace it\nalone for righteousness and merits, since it is offered in Christ to all\nwho with true faith implore it and expect it. For in the precepts of the\nlaw, God appears only, on the one hand, as the rewarder of perfect\nrighteousness, of which we are all destitute; and on the other, as the\nsevere judge of transgressions. But in Christ, his face shines with a\nplenitude of grace and lenity, even towards miserable and unworthy\nsinners.\nIX. Of making use of the law to implore the assistance of God, Augustine\nfrequently treats; as when he writes to Hilary: “The law gives commands,\nin order that, endeavouring to perform them, and being wearied through our\ninfirmity under the law, we may learn to pray for the assistance of\ngrace.” Also to Asellius: “The utility of the law is to convince man of\nhis own infirmity, and to compel him to pray for the gracious remedy\nprovided in Christ.” Also to Innocentius Romanus: “The law commands: grace\nfurnishes strength for the performance.” Again, to Valentine: “God\ncommands what we cannot perform, that we may know for what blessings we\nought to supplicate him.” Again: “The law was given to convict you; that\nbeing convicted you might fear, that fearing you might pray for pardon,\nand not presume on your own strength.” Again: “The end for which the law\nwas given, was to diminish that which was great, to demonstrate that you\nhave of yourself no ability to work righteousness, that thus, being poor,\nindigent, and destitute, you might have recourse to grace for relief.”\nAfterwards he addresses himself to God: “Thus do, O Lord! thus do, O\nmerciful Lord! command that which cannot be performed: even command that\nwhich cannot be performed without thy grace: that when men cannot perform\nit in their own strength, every mouth may be stopped, and no man appear\ngreat in his own estimation. Let all men be mean, and let all the world be\nproved guilty before God.” But I am not wise in collecting so many\ntestimonies, when this holy man has written a treatise expressly on this\nsubject, which he has entitled _De Spiritu et Litera_, On the Spirit and\nLetter. The second use of the law he does not so clearly describe, either\nbecause he knew that it depends on the first, or because he did not so\nfully understand it, or because he wanted words to explain it with\ndistinctness and perspicuity adequate to his ideas of it. Yet this first\noffice of the law is not confined to the pious, but extends also to the\nreprobate. For though they do not, with the children of God, advance so\nfar as, after the mortification of the flesh, to be renewed, and to\nflourish again in the inner man, but, confounded with the first horrors of\nconscience, remain in despair, yet they contribute to manifest the equity\nof the Divine judgment, by their consciences being agitated with such\nviolent emotions. For they are always desirous of cavilling against the\njudgment of God; but now, while it is not yet manifested, they are,\nnevertheless, so confounded with the testimony of the law and of their own\nconscience, that they betray in themselves what they have deserved.\nX. The second office of the law is, to cause those who, unless\nconstrained, feel no concern for justice and rectitude, when they hear its\nterrible sanctions, to be at least restrained by a fear of its penalties.\nAnd they are restrained, not because it internally influences or affects\ntheir minds, but because, being chained, as it were, they refrain from\nexternal acts, and repress their depravity within them, which otherwise\nthey would have wantonly discharged. This makes them neither better nor\nmore righteous in the Divine view. For although, being prevented either by\nfear or by shame, they dare not execute what their minds have contrived,\nnor openly discover the fury of their passions, yet their hearts are not\ndisposed to fear and obey God; and the more they restrain themselves, the\nmore violently they are inflamed within; they ferment, they boil, ready to\nbreak out into any external acts, if they were not prevented by this dread\nof the law. And not only so, they also inveterately hate the law itself,\nand execrate God the lawgiver, so that, if they could, they would wish to\nannihilate him whom they cannot bear, either in commanding that which is\nright, or in punishing the despisers of his majesty. In some, indeed, this\nstate of mind is more evident, in others more concealed; but it is really\nthe case of all who are yet unregenerate, that they are induced to attend\nto the law, not by a voluntary submission, but with reluctance and\nresistance, only by the violence of fear. But yet this constrained and\nextorted righteousness is necessary to the community, whose public\ntranquillity is provided for by God in this instance, while he prevents\nall things being involved in confusion, which would certainly be the case,\nif all men were permitted to pursue their own inclinations. Moreover, it\nis useful even to the children of God, to be exercised by its discipline\nbefore their vocation, while they are destitute of the Spirit of\nsanctification, and are absorbed in carnal folly. For when the dread of\nDivine vengeance restrains them even from external licentiousness,\nalthough, their minds being not yet subdued, they make but a slow progress\nat present, yet they are in some measure accustomed to bear the yoke of\nrighteousness; so that when they are called, they may not be entirely\nunaccustomed to its discipline, as a thing altogether unknown. To this\noffice of the law the Apostle appears particularly to have referred, when\nhe says, “that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the\nlawless and disobedient; for the ungodly and for sinners; for unholy and\nprofane; for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers; for\nmanslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with\nmankind, for men‐stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there\nbe any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.”(800) For he here\nsignifies that it restrains the violence of the carnal desires, which\nwould otherwise indulge themselves in the most unbounded licentiousness.\nXI. But we may apply to both what he elsewhere asserts, that to the Jews\n“the law was a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ;”(801) for there are\ntwo kinds of persons who are led to Christ by its discipline. Some, whom\nwe mentioned in the first place, from too much confidence either in their\nown strength or in their own righteousness, are unfit to receive the grace\nof Christ, till they have first been stripped of every thing. The law,\ntherefore, reduces them to humility by a knowledge of their own misery,\nthat thus they may be prepared to pray for that of which they before\nsupposed themselves not destitute. Others need a bridle to restrain them,\nlest they abandon themselves to carnal licentiousness, to such a degree as\nwholly to depart from all practice of righteousness. For where the Spirit\ndoes not yet reign, there is sometimes such a violent ebullition of the\npassions, as to occasion great danger of the soul that is under their\ninfluence being swallowed up in forgetfulness and contempt of God; which\nwould certainly be the case, if the Lord did not provide this remedy\nagainst it. Those, therefore, whom he has destined to the inheritance of\nhis kingdom, if he do not immediately regenerate them, he keeps under fear\nby the works of the law till the time of his visitation; not that chaste\nand pure fear which ought to be felt by his children, but a fear which is,\nnevertheless, useful to train them, according to their capacity, to true\npiety. Of this we have so many proofs, that there is no need to adduce any\nexample. For all who have lived for a considerable time in ignorance of\nGod will confess it to have been their experience, that they were\nconstrained by the law to a certain kind of fear and reverence of God,\ntill, being regenerated by his Spirit, they began to love him from their\nhearts.\nXII. The third use of the law, which is the principal one, and which is\nmore nearly connected with the proper end of it, relates to the faithful,\nin whose hearts the Spirit of God already lives and reigns. For although\nthe law is inscribed and engraven on their hearts by the finger of\nGod,—that is, although they are so excited and animated by the direction\nof the Spirit, that they desire to obey God,—yet they derive a twofold\nadvantage from the law. For they find it an excellent instrument to give\nthem, from day to day, a better and more certain understanding of the\nDivine will to which they aspire, and to confirm them in the knowledge of\nit. As, though a servant be already influenced by the strongest desire of\ngaining the approbation of his master, yet it is necessary for him\ncarefully to inquire and observe the orders of his master, in order to\nconform to them. Nor let any one of us exempt himself from this necessity;\nfor no man has already acquired so much wisdom, that he could not by the\ndaily instruction of the law make new advances into a purer knowledge of\nthe Divine will. In the next place, as we need not only instruction, but\nalso exhortation, the servant of God will derive this further advantage\nfrom the law; by frequent meditation on it he will be excited to\nobedience, he will be confirmed in it, and restrained from the slippery\npath of transgression. For in this manner should the saints stimulate\nthemselves, because, with whatever alacrity they labour for the\nrighteousness of God according to the Spirit, yet they are always burdened\nwith the indolence of the flesh, which prevents their proceeding with due\npromptitude. To this flesh the law serves as a whip, urging it, like a\ndull and tardy animal, forwards to its work; and even to the spiritual\nman, who is not yet delivered from the burden of the flesh, it will be a\nperpetual spur, that will not permit him to loiter. To this use of the law\nDavid referred, when he celebrated it in such remarkable encomiums as\nthese: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the statutes\nof the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is\npure, enlightening the eyes,” &c.(802) Again: “Thy word is a lamp unto my\nfeet, and a light unto my path;”(803) and many others, which he introduces\nin every part of this psalm. Nor are these assertions repugnant to those\nof Paul, in which he shows, not what service the law renders to the\nregenerate, but what it can bestow upon man merely of itself; whereas the\nPsalmist in these passages celebrates the great advantage derived, through\nthe Divine teaching, from the reading of the law, by those whom God\ninspires with an inward promptitude to obedience. And he adverts not only\nto the precepts, but to the promise of grace annexed to their performance,\nwhich alone causes that which is bitter to become sweet. For what would be\nless amiable than the law, if by demands and threats it only distressed\nthe mind with fear, and harassed it with terror? But David particularly\nshows, that in the law he discovered the Mediator, without whom there is\nnothing pleasant or delightful.\nXIII. Some unskilful men, being unable to discern this distinction, rashly\nexplode Moses altogether, and discard the two tables of the law; because\nthey consider it improper for Christians to adhere to a doctrine which\ncontains the administration of death. Far from us be this profane opinion;\nfor Moses has abundantly taught us, that the law, which in sinners can\nonly produce death, ought to have a better and more excellent use in the\nsaints. For just before his death he thus addressed the people: “Set your\nhearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye\nshall command your children to observe, to do all the words of this law.\nFor it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life.”(804) But if\nno one can deny that the law exhibits a perfect model of righteousness,\neither we ought to have no rule for an upright and just life, or it is\ncriminal for us to deviate from it. For there are not many rules of life,\nbut one, which is perpetually and immutably the same. Wherefore, when\nDavid represents the life of a righteous man as spent in continual\nmeditations on the law,(805) we must not refer it to one period of time\nonly, because it is very suitable for all ages, even to the end of the\nworld. Let us neither be deterred, therefore, nor fly from its\ninstructions, because it prescribes a holiness far more complete than we\nshall attain, as long as we remain in the prison of the body. For it no\nlonger exercises towards us the part of a rigorous exactor, only to be\nsatisfied by the perfect performance of every injunction; but in this\nperfection, to which it exhorts us, it shows us a goal, to aim at which,\nduring the whole of our lives, would be equally conducive to our interest\nand consistent with our duty; in which attempt it is happy for us if we\nfail not. For the whole of this life is a course, which when we have\ncompleted, the Lord will grant us to reach that goal, towards which at so\ngreat a distance our efforts are now vigorously directed.\nXIV. Now, because the law, in regard to the faithful, has the force of an\nexhortation, not to bind their consciences with a curse, but by its\nfrequent admonitions to arouse their indolence, and reprove their\nimperfection,—many persons, when they design to express this liberation\nfrom its curse, say that the law (I still speak of the moral law) is\nabrogated to the faithful; not that it no longer enjoins upon them that\nwhich is right, but only that it ceases to be to them what it was before,\nno longer terrifying and confounding their consciences, condemning and\ndestroying them. And such an abrogation of the law is clearly taught by\nPaul. It appears also to have been preached by our Lord, since he would\nnot have refuted the opinion concerning his abolishing the law, unless it\nhad prevailed among the Jews. Now, as this opinion could not prevail\nwithout any pretext, it is probable that it proceeded from a false\ninterpretation of his doctrine; in the same manner as almost all errors\nhave usually taken some colour from the truth. But lest we ourselves fall\ninto the same error, let us accurately distinguish what is abrogated in\nthe law, and what still remains in force. When the Lord declares that he\ncame “not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,” and that “till heaven and\nearth shall pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the\nlaw, till all be fulfilled,”(806) he sufficiently proves that his advent\nwould detract nothing from the observance of the law. And with sufficient\nreason, since the express end of his advent was to heal the transgressions\nof it. The doctrine of the law remains, therefore, through Christ,\ninviolable; which by tuition, admonition, reproof, and correction, forms\nand prepares us for every good work.\nXV. The assertions of Paul respecting the abrogation of the law evidently\nrelate, not to the instruction itself, but to the power of binding the\nconscience. For the law not only teaches, but authoritatively requires,\nobedience to its commands. If this obedience be not yielded, and even if\nthere be any partial deficiency of duty, it hurls the thunderbolt of its\ncurse. For this reason the Apostle says, that “as many as are of the works\nof the law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one\nthat continueth not in all things.”(807) Now, he affirms those to be “of\nthe works of the law,” who place not their righteousness in the remission\nof sins, by which we are released from the rigour of the law. He teaches\nus, therefore, that we must be released from the bondage of the law,\nunless we would perish in misery under it. But what bondage? the bondage\nof that austere and rigid exaction, which remits nothing from its\nstrictest requirements, and permits no transgression to pass with\nimpunity; I say, Christ, in order to redeem us from this curse, was “made\na curse for us. For it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a\ntree.”(808) In the following chapter, indeed, he tells us, that Christ was\n“made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law;” but in the\nsame sense; for he immediately adds, “that we might receive the adoption\nof sons.”(809) What is this? that we might not be oppressed with a\nperpetual servitude, which would keep our consciences in continual\ndistress with the dread of death. At the same time this truth remains for\never unshaken, that the law has sustained no diminution of its authority,\nbut ought always to receive from us the same veneration and obedience.\nXVI. The case of ceremonies, which have been abrogated, not as to their\neffect, but only as to their use, is very different. Their having been\nabolished by the advent of Christ, is so far from derogating from their\nsanctity, that it rather recommends and renders it more illustrious. For\nas they must have exhibited to the people, in ancient times, a vain\nspectacle, unless they had discovered the virtue of the death and\nresurrection of Christ, so, if they had not ceased, we should, in the\npresent age, have been unable to discern for what purpose they were\ninstituted. To prove, therefore, that the observance of them is not only\nneedless, but even injurious, Paul teaches us that they were shadows, the\nbody of which we have in Christ.(810) We see, then, that the truth shines\nwith greater splendour in their abolition, than if they still continued to\ngive a distant and obscure representation of Christ, who has openly\nappeared. For this reason, at the death of Christ, “the veil of the temple\nwas rent in twain from the top to the bottom;”(811) because, according to\nthe author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the living and express image of\nthe heavenly blessings, which before had been only sketched in obscure\nlineaments, was now clearly revealed. The same truth is conveyed in the\ndeclaration of Christ, that “the law and the prophets were until John;\nsince that time the kingdom of God is preached.”(812) Not that the holy\nfathers had been destitute of that preaching which contains the hope of\nsalvation, and of eternal life, but because they saw only at a distance,\nand under shadows, what we now contemplate in open day. But the reason,\nwhy it was necessary for the Church of God to ascend from those rudiments\nto sublimer heights, is explained by John the Baptist: “the law was given\nby Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”(813) For although\nexpiation of sin was truly promised in the ancient sacrifices, and the ark\nof the covenant was a certain pledge of the paternal favour of God, all\nthese would have been mere shadows, if they had not been founded in the\ngrace of Christ, where alone we may find true and eternal stability. Let\nus firmly maintain, then, that though the legal rites have ceased to be\nobserved, yet their very discontinuance gives us a better knowledge of\ntheir great utility before the advent of Christ, who, abolishing the\nobservance of them, confirmed their virtue and efficacy in his death.\nXVII. The reasoning of Paul is attended with more difficulty: “And you,\nbeing dead in your sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he\nquickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; blotting\nout the hand‐writing of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary\nto us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross,” &c.(814) For\nit seems to extend the abolition of the law somewhat further, as though we\nhad now no concern with its “ordinances.” For they are in an error who\nunderstand it simply of the moral law, the abolition of which they,\nnevertheless, explain to relate to its inexorable severity, rather than to\nits precepts. Others, more acutely and carefully considering the words of\nPaul, perceive that they belong particularly to the ceremonial law; and\nprove that the word “ordinances” is more than once used by Paul in that\nsignification. For he thus expresses himself to the Ephesians: “He is our\npeace, who hath made both one; having abolished the law of commandments\ncontained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new\nman.”(815) That he there speaks of the ceremonies, is very evident; for he\ncalls the law “the middle wall of partition,” by which the Jews were\nseparated from the Gentiles. Wherefore I allow that the former\ncommentators are justly censured by these; but even these do not appear to\nme clearly to explain the meaning of the Apostle. For to compare these two\npassages as in all respects similar, is what I by no means approve. When\nhe designs to assure the Ephesians of their admission into fellowship with\nthe Israelites, he informs them, that the impediment which formerly\nprevented it is now removed. That consisted in ceremonies. For the rites\nof ablutions and sacrifices, by which the Jews were consecrated to the\nLord, caused a separation between them and the Gentiles. But in the\nEpistle to the Colossians he treats of a sublimer mystery. The controversy\nthere relates to the Mosaic observances, to which the false Apostles were\nstrenuously attempting to subject the Christians. But as in the Epistle to\nthe Galatians he goes to the depth of that controversy, and reduces it to\nits source, so also in this place. For if in the rites you contemplate\nnothing but the necessity of performing them, to what purpose were they\ncalled a “hand‐writing that was against us”? and almost the whole of our\nredemption made to consist in its being “blotted out?” Wherefore it is\nevident, that here is something to be considered beside the external\nceremonies. And I am persuaded that I have discovered the genuine meaning,\nat least if that be conceded to me as a truth, which Augustine somewhere\nvery truly asserts, and which he has even borrowed from the positive\nexpressions of an Apostle,(816) that in the Jewish ceremonies there was\nrather a confession of sins than an expiation of them. For what did they\ndo in offering sacrifices, but confess themselves worthy of death, since\nthey substituted victims to be slain in their stead? What were their\npurifications, but confessions that they were themselves impure? Thus the\nhand‐writing both of their sin and of their impurity was frequently\nrenewed by them; but that confession afforded no deliverance. For which\nreason the Apostle says that the death of Christ effected “the redemption\nof the transgressions that were under the first testament.”(817) The\nApostle, therefore, justly denominates the ceremonies “a hand‐writing\nagainst those who observe them;” because by them they publicly attested\ntheir condemnation and impurity. Nor does any objection arise from their\nhaving been also partakers of the same grace with us. For this they\nobtained in Christ, not in the ceremonies, which the Apostle there\ndistinguishes from Christ; for being practised at that time after the\nintroduction of the gospel, they obscured the glory of Christ. We find,\nthen, that the ceremonies, considered by themselves, are beautifully and\nappositely called a “hand‐writing that was against” the salvation of men;\nbecause they were solemn instruments testifying their guilt. When the\nfalse Apostles wished to bring the Church back to the observance of them,\nthe Apostle deeply investigated their signification, and very justly\nadmonished the Colossians into what circumstances they would relapse, if\nthey should suffer themselves to be thus enslaved by them. For they would\nat the same time be deprived of the benefit of Christ; since, by the\neternal expiation that he has once effected, he has abolished those daily\nobservances, which could only attest their sins, but could never cancel\nthem."

          "title": "Chapter VIII. An Exposition Of The Moral Law",
          "content": "Here I think it will not be foreign to our subject to introduce the ten\nprecepts of the law, with a brief exposition of them. For this will more\nclearly evince what I have suggested, that the service which God has once\nprescribed always remains in full force; and will also furnish us with a\nconfirmation of the second remark, that the Jews not only learned from it\nthe nature of true piety, but when they saw their inability to observe it,\nwere led by the fear of its sentence, though not without reluctance, to\nthe Mediator. Now, in giving a summary of those things which are requisite\nto the true knowledge of God, we have shown that we can form no\nconceptions of his greatness, but his majesty immediately discovers itself\nto us, to constrain us to worship him. In the knowledge of ourselves, we\nhave laid down this as a principal article, that being divested of all\nopinion of our own strength, and confidence in our own righteousness, and,\non the other hand, discouraged and depressed by a consciousness of our\npoverty, we should learn true humility and self‐dejection. The Lord\naccomplishes both these things in his law, where, in the first place,\nclaiming to himself the legitimate authority to command, he calls us to\nrevere his Divinity, and prescribes the parts of which this reverence\nconsists; and in the next place, promulgating the rule of his\nrighteousness, (the rectitude of which, our nature, being depraved and\nperverted, perpetually opposes; and from the perfection of which, our\nability, through its indolence and imbecility towards that which is good,\nis at a great distance,) he convicts us both of impotence and of\nunrighteousness. Moreover, the internal law, which has before been said to\nbe inscribed and as it were engraven on the hearts of all men, suggests to\nus in some measure the same things which are to be learned from the two\ntables. For our conscience does not permit us to sleep in perpetual\ninsensibility, but is an internal witness and monitor of the duties we owe\nto God, shows us the difference between good and evil, and so accuses us\nwhen we deviate from our duty. But man, involved as he is in a cloud of\nerrors, scarcely obtains from this law of nature the smallest idea of what\nworship is accepted by God; but is certainly at an immense distance from a\nright understanding of it. Besides, he is so elated with arrogance and\nambition, and so blinded with self‐love, that he cannot yet take a view of\nhimself, and as it were retire within, that he may learn to submit and\nhumble himself, and to confess his misery. Since it was necessary,\ntherefore, both for our dulness and obstinacy, the Lord gave us a written\nlaw; to declare with greater certainty what in the law of nature was too\nobscure, and by arousing our indolence, to make a deeper impression on our\nunderstanding and memory.\nII. Now, it is easy to perceive, what we are to learn from the law;\nnamely, that God, as he is our Creator, justly sustains towards us the\ncharacter of a Father and of a Lord; and that on this account we owe to\nhim glory and reverence, love and fear. Moreover, that we are not at\nliberty to follow every thing to which the violence of our passions may\nincite us; but that we ought to be attentive to his will, and to practise\nnothing but what is pleasing to him. In the next place, that righteousness\nand rectitude are a delight, but iniquity an abomination to him; and that,\ntherefore, unless we will with impious ingratitude rebel against our\nMaker, we must necessarily spend our whole lives in the practice of\nrighteousness. For if we manifest a becoming reverence for him, only when\nwe prefer his will to our own, it follows that there is no other\nlegitimate worship of him, but the observance of righteousness, sanctity,\nand purity. Nor can we pretend to excuse ourselves by a want of ability,\nlike insolvent debtors. For it is improper for us to measure the glory of\nGod by our ability; for whatever may be our characters, he ever remains\nlike himself, the friend of righteousness, the enemy of iniquity. Whatever\nhe requires of us, since he can require nothing but what is right, we are\nunder a natural obligation to obey; but our inability is our own fault.\nFor if we are bound by our own passions, which are under the government of\nsin, so that we are not at liberty to obey our Father, there is no reason\nwhy we should plead this necessity in our defence, the criminality of\nwhich is within ourselves, and must be imputed to us.\nIII. When we have made such a proficiency as this by means of the\ninstruction of the law, we ought, under the same teacher, to retire within\nourselves; from which we may learn two things: First, by comparing our\nlife with the righteousness of the law, we shall find, that we are very\nfar from acting agreeably to the will of God, and are therefore unworthy\nto retain a place among his creatures, much less to be numbered among his\nchildren. Secondly, by examining our strength, we shall see, that it is\nnot only unequal to the observance of the law, but a mere nullity. The\nnecessary consequence of this will be a diffidence in our own strength,\nand an anxiety and trepidation of mind. For the conscience cannot sustain\nthe load of iniquity, without an immediate discovery of the Divine\njudgment. And the Divine judgment cannot be perceived, without inspiring a\ndread of death. Compelled also by proofs of its impotence, it cannot avoid\nfalling into an absolute despair of its own strength. Both these\ndispositions produce humility and dejection. The result of all this is,\nthat the man terrified with the apprehension of eternal death, which he\nsees justly impending over him for his unrighteousness, betakes himself\nentirely to the Divine mercy, as to the only port of salvation; and\nperceiving his inability to fulfil the commands of the law, and feeling\nnothing but despair in himself, he implores and expects assistance from\nanother quarter.\nIV. But not contented with having conciliated a reverence for his\nrighteousness, the Lord has also subjoined promises and threatenings, in\norder that our hearts might imbibe a love for him, and at the same time a\nhatred to iniquity. For since the eyes of our mind are too dim to be\nattracted with the mere beauty of virtue, our most merciful Father has\nbeen graciously pleased to allure us to the love and worship of himself by\nthe sweetness of his rewards. He announces, therefore, that he has\nreserved rewards for virtue, and that the person who obeys his\ncommandments shall not labour in vain. He proclaims, on the contrary, not\nonly that unrighteousness is execrable in his sight, but also that it\nshall not escape with impunity; but that he will avenge himself on all the\ndespisers of his majesty. And to urge us by all possible motives, he\npromises also the blessings of the present life, as well as eternal\nfelicity, to the obedience of those who keep his commandments, the\ntransgressors of which he threatens not only with present calamities, but\nwith the torments of eternal death. For that promise, “these if a man do,\nhe shall live in them,”(818) and this correspondent threatening, “the soul\nthat sinneth, it shall die,”(819) undoubtedly relate to a future and\nendless immortality or death. Wherever we read of the Divine benevolence\nor wrath, the former comprehends eternal life, the latter eternal\ndestruction. Now, of present blessings and curses, the law contains a long\ncatalogue. The penal sanctions display the consummate purity of God, which\ncannot tolerate iniquity; while the promises not only manifest his perfect\nlove of righteousness, which he cannot defraud of its reward, but likewise\nillustrate his wonderful goodness. For since we, with all that belongs to\nus, are indebted to his majesty, whatever he requires of us, he most\njustly demands as the payment of a debt; but the payment of a debt is not\nentitled to remuneration. Therefore he recedes from the strictness of his\nclaims, when he proposes a reward to our obedience, which is not performed\nspontaneously, as if it were not a duty. But the effect of those promises\non us has partly been mentioned already, and will hereafter more clearly\nappear in its proper place. Suffice it at present, if we remember and\nconsider that the promises of the law contain no mean recommendation of\nrighteousness, to make it more evident how much God is pleased with the\nobservance of it; and that the penal sanctions are annexed, to render\nunrighteousness more execrable, lest the sinner, amidst the fascinations\nof sin, should forget that the judgment of the Legislator awaits him.\nV. Now, since the Lord, when about to deliver a rule of perfect\nrighteousness, referred all the parts of it to his own will, this shows\nthat nothing is more acceptable to him than obedience. This is worthy of\nthe most diligent observation, since the licentiousness of the human mind\nis so inclined to the frequent invention of various services in order to\nmerit his favour. For this irreligious affectation of religion, which is a\nprinciple innate in the human mind, has betrayed itself in all ages, and\nbetrays itself even in the present day; for men always take a pleasure in\ncontriving some way of attaining righteousness, which is not agreeable to\nthe Divine word. Hence, among those which are commonly esteemed good\nworks, the precepts of the law hold a very contracted station, the\nnumberless multitude of human inventions occupying almost the whole space.\nBut what was the design of Moses, unless it was to repress such an\nunwarrantable license, when, after the promulgation of the law, he\naddressed the people in the following manner! “Observe and hear all these\nwords which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy\nchildren after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right\nin the sight of the Lord thy God. What thing soever I command you, observe\nto do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.”(820) And\nbefore, when he had declared that this was their wisdom and their\nunderstanding in the sight of other nations, that they had received\nstatutes, and judgments, and ceremonies, from the Lord, he had added,\n“Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the\nthings which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all\nthe days of thy life.”(821) Foreseeing that the Israelites would not rest,\nbut, even after the reception of the law, would labour to produce new\nspecies of righteousness, foreign from what the law requires, unless they\nshould be rigorously restrained, God pronounces that his word comprehends\nthe perfection of righteousness; and yet, though this ought most\neffectually to have prevented them, they were guilty of that very\npresumption which was so expressly forbidden. But what is this to us? We\nare certainly bound by the same declaration; for the claims of the Lord on\nbehalf of his law, that it contains the doctrine of perfect righteousness,\nbeyond all doubt remain perpetually the same; yet not contented with it,\nwe are wonderfully laborious in inventing and performing other good works,\none after another. The best remedy for this fault will be a constant\nattention to this reflection; that the law was given to us from heaven to\nteach us a perfect righteousness; that in it no righteousness is taught,\nbut that which is conformable to the decrees of the Divine will; that it\nis therefore vain to attempt new species of works in order to merit the\nfavour of God, whose legitimate worship consists solely in obedience, but\nthat any pursuit of good works deviating from the law of God is an\nintolerable profanation of the Divine and real righteousness. There is\nmuch truth also in the observation of Augustine, who calls obedience to\nGod sometimes the parent and guardian, and sometimes the origin of all\nvirtues.\nVI. But when we have given an exposition of the Divine law, we shall then\nmore suitably and profitably confirm what has been already advanced\nconcerning its office and use. Before we enter, however, on the discussion\nof each article separately, it will be useful to premise some things which\nmay contribute to a general knowledge of it. First, let it be understood,\nthat the law inculcates a conformity of life, not only to external\nprobity, but also to internal and spiritual righteousness. Now, though\nnone can deny this, yet very few persons pay proper attention to it. This\narises from their not considering the Legislator, by whose nature we ought\nto estimate also the nature of the law. If a king prohibit, by an edict,\nadultery, murder, or theft, no man, I confess, will be liable to the\npenalty of such a law, who has only conceived in his mind a desire to\ncommit adultery, murder, or theft, but has not perpetrated any of them.\nBecause the superintendence of a mortal legislator extends only to the\nexternal conduct, and his prohibitions are not violated unless the crimes\nbe actually committed. But God, whose eye nothing escapes, and who esteems\nnot so much the external appearance as the purity of the heart, in the\nprohibition of adultery, murder, and theft, comprises a prohibition of\nlust, wrath, hatred, coveting what belongs to another, fraud, and every\nsimilar vice. For, being a spiritual Legislator, he addresses himself to\nthe soul as much as to the body. Now, the murder of the soul is wrath and\nhatred; the theft of the soul is evil concupiscence and avarice; the\nadultery of the soul is lust. But it will be said, that human laws also\nrelate to designs and intentions, and not to fortuitous events. This I\ngrant; but they relate to such designs and intentions as have been\nmanifested in outward actions. They examine and consider with what\nintention every act has been performed; but do not scrutinize the secret\nthoughts. Human laws therefore are satisfied, when a man abstains from\nexternal transgression. But, on the contrary, the Divine law being given\nto our minds, the proper regulation of them is the principal requisite to\na righteous observance of it. But men in general, even while they\nresolutely dissemble their contempt of the law, dispose their eyes, their\nfeet, their hands, and all the parts of their body, to some kind of\nobservance of it, while at the same time their hearts are entirely\nalienated from all obedience to it, and they suppose that they have\ndischarged their duty, if they have concealed from man what they practise\nin the sight of God. They hear the commands, Thou shalt not kill, Thou\nshalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal. They draw not the sword\nto commit murder; they never associate with harlots; they lay no violent\nhands on the property of others. All these things thus far are well; but\nin their whole souls they breathe after murders, they kindle into lust,\nthey look with dishonest eyes on the property of others, and in their\ncupidity they devour it. Now, then, they are destitute of the principal\nrequisite of the law. Whence arises such gross stupidity, but from\ndiscarding the Legislator, and accommodating a righteousness to their own\ninclination? These persons Paul strongly opposes, when he affirms that\n“the law is spiritual;”(822) signifying that it requires not only the\nobedience of the soul, the understanding, and the will, but even an\nangelic purity, which, being cleansed from all the pollution of the flesh,\nmay savour entirely of the Spirit.\nVII. When we say that this is the sense of the law, we are not introducing\na novel interpretation of our own, but following Christ, who is the best\ninterpreter of it. For the people having imbibed from the Pharisees the\ncorrupt opinion, that he, who has perpetrated no external act of\ndisobedience to the law, is an observer of the law, he confutes this very\ndangerous error, and pronounces an unchaste look at a woman to be\nadultery; he declares them to be murderers, who hate a brother; he makes\nthem “in danger of the judgment,” who have only conceived resentment in\ntheir hearts; them “in danger of the council,” who in murmuring or\nquarrelling have discovered any sign of an angry mind; and them “in danger\nof hell fire,” who with opprobrious and slanderous language have broken\nforth into open rage.(823) Persons who have not perceived these things,\nhave pretended that Christ was another Moses, the giver of an evangelical\nlaw, which supplied the deficiencies of the law of Moses. Whence that\ncommon maxim, concerning the perfection of the evangelical law, that it is\nfar superior to the old law—a maxim in many respects very pernicious. For\nwhen we introduce a summary of the commandments, it will appear from Moses\nhimself what an indignity this fixes on the Divine law. It certainly\ninsinuates that all the sanctity of the fathers under the Old Testament,\nwas not very remote from hypocrisy, and draws us aside from that one\nperpetual rule of righteousness. But there is not the least difficulty in\nthe confutation of this error; for they have supposed that Christ made\nadditions to the law, whereas he only restored it to its genuine purity,\nby clearing it from the obscurities and blemishes which it had contracted\nfrom the falsehoods and the leaven of the Pharisees.\nVIII. It must be observed, in the second place, that the commands and\nprohibitions always imply more than the words express; but this must be so\nrestricted, that we may not make it a Lesbian rule, by the assistance of\nwhich the Scripture may be licentiously perverted, and any sense be\nextorted at pleasure from any passage. For some people, by this immoderate\nand excursive liberty, cause one person to despise the authority of the\nlaw, and another to despair of understanding it. Therefore, if it be\npossible, we must find some way that may lead us by a straight and steady\ncourse to the will of God. We must inquire, I say, how far our\ninterpretation ought to exceed the limits of the expressions; that it may\nevidently appear, not to be an appendix of human glosses annexed to the\nDivine law, but a faithful explanation of the pure and genuine sense of\nthe legislator. Indeed, in all the commandments, the figure synecdoche, by\nwhich a part is expressed instead of the whole, is so conspicuous, that he\nmay justly be the object of ridicule, who would restrict the sense of the\nlaw within the narrow limits of the words. It is plain, then, that a sober\nexposition of the law goes beyond the words of it; but how far, remains\ndoubtful, unless some rule be laid down. The best rule, then, I conceive\nwill be, that the exposition be directed to the design of the precept;\nthat in regard to every precept it should be considered for what end it\nwas given. For example, every precept is either imperative or prohibitory.\nThe true meaning of both these kinds of precepts will immediately occur to\nus, if we consider the design or the end of them; as the end of the fifth\ncommandment is, that honour may be given to them to whom God assigns it.\nThe substance of this precept, then, is, that it is right, and pleasing to\nGod, that we should honour those on whom he has conferred any excellence,\nand that contemptuous and contumacious conduct towards them is an\nabomination to him. The design of the first commandment is, that God alone\nmay be worshipped. The substance of this precept, then, will be, that true\npiety, that is, the worship of his majesty, is pleasing to God, and that\nhe abominates impiety. Thus in every commandment we should first examine\nthe subject of it; in the next place we should inquire the end of it, till\nwe discover what the Legislator really declares in it to be either\npleasing or displeasing to him. Lastly, we must draw an argument from this\ncommandment to the opposite of it, in this manner:—If this please God, the\ncontrary must displease him; if this displease him, the contrary must\nplease him; if he enjoin this, he forbids the contrary; if he forbid this,\nhe enjoins the contrary.\nIX. What we now rather obscurely hint at, will be fully and practically\nelucidated in our exposition of the commandments. Wherefore it is\nsufficient to have suggested it; only the last position, which otherwise\nmight not be understood, or, if understood, might seem unreasonable,\nrequires to be briefly established by suitable proof. It needs no proof,\nthat an injunction of any thing good is a prohibition of the opposite\nevil; for every man will concede it. And common sense will easily admit,\nthat a prohibition of crimes is a command to practise the contrary duties.\nIt is commonly considered as a commendation of virtues, when censure is\npassed on the opposite vices. But we require somewhat more than is\ncommonly intended by those forms of expression. For men generally\nunderstand the virtue which is opposite to any vice to be an abstinence\nfrom that vice; but we affirm that it goes further, even to the actual\nperformance of the opposite duty. Therefore, in this precept, “Thou shalt\nnot kill,” the common sense of mankind will perceive nothing more than\nthat we ought to abstain from all acts of injury to others, and from all\ndesire to commit any such acts. I maintain that it also implies, that we\nshould do every thing that we possibly can towards the preservation of the\nlife of our neighbour. And not to speak without reason, I prove it in the\nfollowing manner: God forbids us to injure the safety of our brother,\nbecause he wishes his life to be dear and precious to us: he therefore at\nthe same time requires of us all those offices of love which may\ncontribute to the preservation of it. Thus we perceive, that the end of\nthe precept will always discover to us whatever it enjoins or forbids us\nto do.\nX. Many reasons are frequently given, why God has, as it were, in\nincomplete precepts, rather partially intimated his will than positively\nexpressed it; but the reason which affords me more satisfaction than all\nothers is the following. Because the flesh always endeavours to extenuate,\nand by specious pretexts to conceal the turpitude of sin, unless it be\nexceedingly palpable, he has proposed, by way of example, in every kind of\ntransgression, that which is most atrocious and detestable, and the\nmention of which inspires us with horror, in order that our minds might be\nimpressed with the greater detestation of every sin. This often deceives\nus in forming an opinion of vices; if they be private, we extenuate them.\nThe Lord destroys these subterfuges, when he accustoms us to refer the\nwhole multitude of vices to these general heads, which best represent the\nabominable nature of every species of transgressions. For example, anger\nand hatred are not supposed to be such execrable crimes when they are\nmentioned under their own proper appellations; but when they are forbidden\nto us under the name of murder, we have a clearer perception how\nabominable they are in the view of God, by whose word they are classed\nunder such a flagitious and horrible species of crimes; and being\ninfluenced by his judgment, we accustom ourselves more seriously to\nconsider the atrociousness of those offences which we previously accounted\ntrivial.\nXI. In the third place, let it be considered, what is intended by the\ndivision of the Divine law into two tables; the frequent and solemn\nmention of which all wise men will judge not to be without some particular\ndesign. And we have a reason at hand, which removes all ambiguity on this\nsubject. For God has divided his law into two parts, which comprise the\nperfection of righteousness, so that he has assigned the first part to the\nduties of religion, which peculiarly belongs to the worship of his\nmajesty, and the second to those duties of charity, which respect men. The\nfirst foundation of righteousness is certainly the worship of God; and if\nthis be destroyed, all the other branches of righteousness, like the parts\nof a disjointed and falling edifice, are torn asunder and scattered. For\nwhat kind of righteousness will you pretend to, because you refrain from\nharassing men by acts of theft and rapine, if at the same time you\natrociously and sacrilegiously defraud the majesty of God of the glory\nwhich is due to him?—because you do not pollute your body with\nfornication, if you blasphemously profane the sacred name of God?—because\nyou murder no man, if you strive to destroy and extinguish all memory of\nGod? It is in vain, therefore, to boast of righteousness without religion;\nas well might the trunk of a body be exhibited as a beautiful object,\nafter the head has been cut off. Nor is religion only the head of\nrighteousness, but the very soul of it, constituting all its life and\nvigour; for without the fear of God, men preserve no equity and love among\nthemselves. We therefore call the worship of God the principle and\nfoundation of righteousness, because, if that be wanting, whatever equity,\ncontinence, and temperance men may practise among themselves, it is all\nvain and frivolous in the sight of God. We assert also that it is the\nsource and soul of righteousness; because men are taught by it to live\ntemperately and justly with one another, if they venerate God as the judge\nof right and wrong. In the first table, therefore, he instructs us in\npiety and the proper duties of religion, in which his majesty is to be\nworshipped; in the second he prescribes the duties which the fear of his\nname should excite us to practise in society. For this reason our Lord, as\nthe evangelists inform us,(824) summarily comprised the whole law in two\nprincipal points—that we love God with all our heart, with all our soul,\nand with all our strength; and that we love our neighbour as ourselves. Of\nthe two parts in which he comprehends the whole law, we see how he directs\none towards God, and assigns the other to men.\nXII. But, although the whole law is contained in these two principal\npoints, yet our God, in order to remove every pretext of excuse, has been\npleased in the ten commandments more diffusely and explicitly to declare,\nas well those things which relate to our honour, love, and fear of him, as\nthose which pertain to that charity, which he commands us for his sake to\nexercise towards men. Nor is it a useless study to examine into the\ndivision of the commandments; provided you remember it is a subject of\nsuch a nature, that every man ought to be at liberty to judge of it, and\nthat we ought not contentiously to oppose any who may differ from us\nrespecting it. But we are under a necessity of touching on this topic,\nlest the reader should despise or wonder at the division that we shall\nadopt, as a novel invention. That the law is divided into ten precepts, is\nbeyond all controversy, being frequently established by the authority of\nGod himself. The question, therefore, is not concerning the number of the\nprecepts, but concerning the manner of dividing them. Those who divide\nthem, so as to assign three precepts to the first table, and leave the\nremaining seven to the second, expunge from the number the precept\nconcerning images, or at least conceal it under the first; whereas it is\nundoubtedly delivered by the Lord as a distinct commandment. But the\ntenth, against coveting the property of our neighbour, they improperly\ndivide into two. We shall see presently that such a method of division was\nunknown in purer ages. Others reckon with us four articles in the first\ntable; but the first commandment they consider as a simple promise,\nwithout a precept. Now, I understand the “ten words” mentioned by Moses to\nbe ten precepts; and I think I see that number disposed in the most\nbeautiful order. And therefore, unless I am convinced by clear argument,\nleaving them in possession of their opinion, I shall follow what appears\nto me to be preferable; that is, that what they make the first precept is\na preface to the whole law; that it is followed by the precepts, four\nbelonging to the first table and six to the second, in the order in which\nthey will now be recited. Origen has mentioned this division as if it were\nuniversally received in his time without any controversy. Augustine also\ncoincides with us; for in enumerating them to Boniface, he observes this\norder: That God alone be religiously worshipped; that no adoration be paid\nto an idol; that the name of the Lord be not taken in vain. He had before\nspoken separately of the shadowy precept of the sabbath. It is true, that\nin another passage he expresses his approbation of the former division,\nbut for a most trivial reason; namely, that if the first table be digested\ninto three precepts, the trinal number will be a more conspicuous\nexhibition of the mystery of the Trinity. In the same place, however, he\ndoes not conceal that in other respects he prefers our division. Beside\nthese writers, the author of the unfinished treatise on Matthew is of the\nsame opinion with us. Josephus, doubtless according to the common opinion\nof his time, assigns five precepts to each table. This is repugnant to\nreason, because it confounds the distinction between religion and charity;\nand is also refuted by the authority of our Lord, who in Matthew places\nthe precept concerning honour to parents in the second table. Now let us\nhear God himself speaking in his own words.\nThe First Commandment.\n_I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of\nEgypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods\nbefore me._\nXIII. Whether you make the first sentence a part of the first commandment,\nor read it separately, is a matter of indifference to me, provided you\nallow it to be a preface to the whole law. The first object of attention\nin making laws is to guard against their being abrogated by contempt.\nTherefore God in the first place provides, that the majesty of the law,\nwhich he is about to deliver, may never fall into contempt; and to\nsanction it he uses a threefold argument. He asserts his authority and\nright of giving commands, and thereby lays his chosen people under a\nnecessity of obeying them. He exhibits a promise of grace, to allure them\nby its charms to the pursuit of holiness. He reminds the Israelites of his\nfavour, to convict them of ingratitude if they do not conduct themselves\nin a manner correspondent to his goodness. The name LORD, or JEHOVAH,\ndesignates his authority and legitimate dominion. For if all things be of\nhim, and if in him all things consist, it is reasonable that all things be\nreferred to him, agreeably to the observation of Paul.(825) Therefore by\nthis word alone we are brought into complete subjection to the power of\nthe Divine majesty; for it would be monstrous for us to desire to remove\nourselves from his jurisdiction, out of whom we cannot exist.\nXIV. After having shown that he has a right to command, and that obedience\nis his just due,—that he may not appear to constrain us by necessity\nalone, he sweetly allures us by pronouncing himself the God of the Church.\nFor the expression implies the mutual relation which is contained in that\npromise, “I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”(826) Whence\nChrist proves the immortality of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the\ndeclaration of the Lord, that he is their God.(827) Wherefore it is the\nsame as if he had said, I have chosen you as my people, not only to bless\nyou in the present life, but to bestow upon you abundant felicity in the\nlife to come. The design of this favour is remarked in various places in\nthe law; for when the Lord in mercy condescends to number us among the\nsociety of his people, “He chooseth us,” says Moses, “to be a peculiar\npeople unto himself, a holy people, to keep his commandments.”(828) Hence\nthat exhortation, “Ye shall be holy, for I am holy.”(829) Now, from these\ntwo considerations is derived the remonstrance of the Lord by the Prophet:\n“A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master; if then I be a\nfather, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my\nfear?”(830)\nXV. Next follows a recital of his kindness, which ought to produce a most\npowerful effect upon our minds, in proportion to the detestable guilt of\ningratitude, even among men. He reminded the Israelites, indeed, of a\nfavour which they had recently experienced, but which, on account of its\nmagnitude and concomitant miracles, being worthy of everlasting\nremembrance, might also have an influence on succeeding generations.\nBesides, it was particularly suitable to the present occasion, when the\nlaw was about to be published; for the Lord suggests that they were\nliberated from a miserable slavery in order that they might serve the\nauthor of their liberty with a promptitude of reverence and obedience. To\nretain us in the true and exclusive worship of himself, he generally\ndistinguishes himself by certain epithets, by which he discriminates his\nsacred name from all idols and fictitious deities. For, as I have before\nobserved, such is our proneness to vanity and presumption, that as soon as\nGod is mentioned, our mind is unable to guard itself from falling into\nsome vain imagination. Therefore, when God intends to apply a remedy to\nthis evil, he adorns his majesty with certain titles, and thus\ncircumscribes us with barriers, that we may not run into various follies,\nand presumptuously invent to ourselves some new deity, discarding the\nliving God, and setting up an idol in his stead. For this reason the\nProphets, whenever they intend a proper designation of him, invest him,\nand as it were surround him, with those characters under which he had\nmanifested himself to the people of Israel. Yet, when he is called “the\nGod of Abraham,” or “the God of Israel,” when he is said to reside\n“between the cherubim,” “in the temple,” “at Jerusalem,”(831) these and\nsimilar forms of expression do not confine him to one place, or to one\nnation; they are only used to fix the thoughts of the pious on that God,\nwho, in the covenant which he has made with Israel, has given such a\nrepresentation of himself, that it is not proper to deviate in the\nsmallest instance from such a model. Nevertheless, let it be concluded,\nthat the deliverance of the Jews is mentioned to induce them to devote\nthemselves with more alacrity to the service of God, who justly claims a\nright to their obedience. But, that we may not suppose this to have no\nrelation to us, it behoves us to consider, that the servitude of Israel in\nEgypt was a type of the spiritual captivity, in which we are all detained,\ntill our celestial Deliverer extricates us by the power of his arm, and\nintroduces us into the kingdom of liberty. As formerly, therefore, when he\ndesigned to restore the dispersed Israelites to the worship of his name,\nhe rescued them from the intolerable tyranny of Pharaoh, by which they\nwere oppressed, so now he delivers all those, whose God he declares\nhimself to be, from the fatal dominion of Satan, which was represented by\nthat corporeal captivity. Wherefore there is no one, whose mind ought not\nto be excited to listen to the law, which he is informed came from the\nKing of kings; from whom as all creatures derive their origin, so it is\nreasonable that they should regard him as their end in all things. Every\nman, I say, ought to welcome the Legislator; to observe whose commands he\nis taught that he is particularly chosen; from whose benignity he expects\nan abundance of temporal blessings, and a life of immortality and glory;\nby whose wonderful power and mercy he knows himself to be delivered from\nthe jaws of death.\nXVI. Having firmly established the authority of his law, he publishes the\nfirst commandment, “That we should have no other gods before him.” The end\nof this precept is, that God chooses to have the sole preëminence, and to\nenjoy undiminished his authority among his people. To produce this end, he\nenjoins us to keep at a distance from all impiety and superstition, by\nwhich we should either diminish or obscure the glory of his Deity; and for\nthe same reason he directs us to worship and adore him in the exercise of\ntrue piety. The simplicity of the language almost expresses this; for we\ncannot “have” God without at the same time comprising all that belongs to\nhim. Therefore, when he forbids us to “have” any other gods, he implies,\nthat we must not transfer to another what belongs to him. But although the\nduties we owe to God are innumerable, yet they may not improperly be\nclassed under four general heads—adoration, a necessary branch of which is\nthe spiritual obedience of the conscience; trust; invocation; and\nthanksgiving. By adoration I mean the reverence and worship which he\nreceives from every one of us who has submitted to his majesty. Wherefore\nit is not without reason that I make it partly to consist in a subjection\nof our consciences to his law; [for it is a spiritual homage which is\nrendered to him, as to a sovereign King possessed of all power over our\nsouls.] Trust is a secure dependence on him arising from a knowledge of\nhis perfections; when ascribing to him all wisdom, righteousness, power,\ntruth, and goodness, we esteem ourselves happy only in communications from\nhim. Invocation is the application of our minds, under every pressure of\nnecessity, resorting to his fidelity, faithfulness, and assistance, as its\nonly defence. Thanksgiving is gratitude, which ascribes to him the praise\nof all blessings. As the Lord permits no portion of these duties to be\ntransferred to another, so he commands them to be wholly given to himself.\nNor will it be sufficient for you to refrain from worshipping any other\ngod, unless you also refrain from imitating certain nefarious despisers,\nwho take the compendious method of treating all religions with contempt.\nBut the observance of this precept must be preceded by true religion,\nleading our minds to the living God; that being endued with the knowledge\nof him, they may aspire to admire, fear, and worship his majesty, to\nreceive his communication of blessings, to request his aid upon all\noccasions, to acknowledge and celebrate the magnificence of his works, as\nthe sole end in all the actions of our lives. We must also beware of\ncorrupt superstition, by which those whose minds are diverted from the\ntrue God, are carried about after various deities. Therefore, if we be\ncontented with one God, let us remember what has before been observed,\nthat all fictitious deities must be driven far away, and that we must not\ndivide that worship which he claims exclusively to himself. For it is\ncriminal to detract even the smallest portion from his glory; he must be\nleft in possession of all that belongs to him. The following clause,\n“before me,” aggravates the atrociousness of the offence; for God is\nprovoked to jealousy whenever we substitute the figments of our own minds\ninstead of him; just as an immodest woman, by openly introducing an\nadulterer into the presence of her husband, would inflame his mind with\nthe greater resentment. When God, therefore, by the presence of his power\nand grace, gave a proof of his regard to the people whom he had chosen,—in\norder the more forcibly to deter them from the crime of rebellion against\nhim, he warns them of the impossibility of introducing new deities without\nhis being a witness and spectator of the sacrilege. For this presumption\nrises to the highest degree of impiety, when man imagines that he can\nelude the observation of God in his acts of rebellion. God, on the\ncontrary, proclaims, that whatever we devise, whatever we attempt,\nwhatever we perform, is present to his view. Our conscience must therefore\nbe pure even from the most latent thoughts of apostasy, if we wish our\nreligion to obtain the approbation of the Lord. For he requires from us\nthe glory due to his Divinity undiminished and uncorrupted, not only in\nexternal confession, but in his own eyes, which penetrate the inmost\nrecesses of our hearts.\nThe Second Commandment.\n_Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness\nof any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth\nbeneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not\nbow down thyself to them, nor serve them._\nXVII. As in the preceding commandment the Lord has declared himself to be\nthe one God, besides whom no other deities ought to be imagined or\nworshipped, so in this he more clearly reveals his nature, and the kind of\nworship with which he ought to be honoured, that we may not dare to form\nany carnal conceptions of him. The end, therefore, of this precept is,\nthat he will not have his legitimate worship profaned with superstitious\nrites. Wherefore, in a word, he calls us off, and wholly abstracts us from\ncarnal observances, which our foolish minds are accustomed to devise, when\nthey conceive of God according to the grossness of their own\napprehensions; and therefore he calls us to the service which rightfully\nbelongs to him; that is, the spiritual worship which he has instituted. He\nmarks what is the grossest transgression of this kind; that is, external\nidolatry. And this precept consists of two parts. The first restrains us\nfrom licentiously daring to make God, who is incomprehensible, the subject\nof our senses, or to represent him under any visible form. The second\nprohibits us from paying religious adoration to any images. He likewise\nbriefly enumerates all the forms, in which he used to be represented by\nprofane and superstitious nations. By those things which are in heaven, he\nmeans the sun, the moon, and the other stars, and perhaps birds; as, when\nhe explains his meaning in the fourth chapter of Deuteronomy, he mentions\nbirds as well as the stars.(832) This I should not have remarked, had I\nnot known some persons injudiciously refer this clause to angels. I omit\nthe other particulars, as needing no explanation. And in the first\nbook(833) we have already sufficiently proved that whatever visible\nrepresentations of God are invented by man, are diametrically opposite to\nhis nature; and that, therefore, as soon as ever idols are introduced,\ntrue religion is immediately corrupted and adulterated.\nXVIII. The penal sanction which is annexed ought to have no small\ninfluence in arousing us from our lethargy. He thus threatens:\n_For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of\nthe fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation\nof them that hate me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them\nthat love me, and keep my commandments._\nThis is equivalent to a declaration that it is to him alone that we ought\nto adhere. And to urge us to it, he announces his power, which he permits\nnone with impunity to despise or undervalue. For the Hebrew word _El_,\nwhich is here used for God, is expressive of strength. In the second\nplace, he calls himself “a jealous God,” who can bear no rival. Thirdly,\nhe declares that he will avenge his majesty and glory on those who\ntransfer it to creatures or to graven images; and that not with the\ntransient punishment of the original transgressors only, but of their\nposterity to the third and fourth generation; that is, of those who shall\nimitate the impiety of their fathers; as he also permanently displays his\nmercy and goodness, through a long line of posterity, to those who love\nhim and keep his law. It is very common for God to assume the character of\na husband to us; for the union, in which he connects us with himself, when\nhe receives us into the bosom of his Church, bears a resemblance to the\nsacred conjugal relation, which requires to be supported by mutual\nfidelity. As he performs towards us all the duties of a true and faithful\nhusband, so he demands from us the reciprocal duties of conjugal love and\nchastity; that is, that we do not prostitute our souls to Satan, to lust,\nand to the impurity of the carnal appetites. Wherefore, when he reproves\nthe apostasy of the Jews, he complains that they had discarded chastity,\nand were polluted with adulteries.(834) Therefore, as a husband, in\nproportion to the superiority of his purity and chastity, is the more\ngrievously incensed, if he perceive the affection of his wife inclining to\na rival, so the Lord, who has in truth espoused us to himself, declares\nthat he feels the most ardent jealousy, whenever we neglect the sacred\npurity of his conjugal relation to us, and defile ourselves with criminal\nlusts, but especially when we transfer to any other, or adulterate with\nany superstition, the worship of his majesty, which ought to be preserved\nin the most consummate perfection; since by such conduct we not only\nviolate the faith pledged in our nuptials, but even pollute our souls with\nspiritual adultery.\nXIX. Let us inquire what he intends by his threatening to “visit the\niniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth\ngeneration.” For besides that it is inconsistent with the equity of the\nDivine justice to inflict upon an innocent person the punishment due to\nthe offences of another, God himself declares that “the son shall not bear\nthe iniquity of the father.”(835) But this expression is repeated more\nthan once, concerning a deferring to future generations of the punishments\nof crimes committed by their ancestors. For Moses frequently speaks of\n“the Lord visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the\nthird and fourth generation.”(836) In like manner Jeremiah: “Thou showest\nloving‐kindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the\nfathers into the bosom of their children after them.”(837) Some, who\nlabour very hard to solve this difficulty, are of opinion that its meaning\nis to be confined to temporal punishments; which if children sustain\nthrough the sins of their parents, there is nothing absurd in it; because\nthey frequently conduce to the salvation of those on whom they are\ninflicted. This is certainly true. For Isaiah denounced to Hezekiah, that\non account of the sin which he had committed, his sons should be despoiled\nof the kingdom and carried away into exile.(838) The families of Pharaoh\nand Abimelech are afflicted on account of the injury sustained by\nAbraham.(839) But when this is adduced as a solution of these questions,\nit is rather an evasion of it, than a proper explanation. For in this and\nin similar places the Lord threatens a punishment too great to be\nterminated by the limits of the present life. It must therefore be\nunderstood as a declaration that the curse of the Lord righteously rests,\nnot only on the person of an impious man, but also on his whole family.\nWhere it has rested, what can be expected, but that the father, being\ndestitute of the Spirit of God, will lead a most flagitious life; and that\nthe son, experiencing, in consequence of the iniquity of his father, a\nsimilar dereliction by the Lord, will pursue the same path to perdition;\nand that the grandson and the great grandson, the execrable posterity of\ndetestable men, will run headlong after them down the same precipice of\ndestruction?\nXX. First let us inquire, whether such punishment be inconsistent with the\nDivine justice. If the whole nature of man be worthy of condemnation, we\nknow that destruction awaits those who are not favoured by the Lord with\nthe communication of his grace. Nevertheless, they perish through their\nown iniquity, and not through the unjust hatred of God. Nor is there any\nroom left for expostulation, why they are not assisted by Divine grace to\nobtain salvation as well as others. Since it is a punishment, therefore,\ninflicted on the impious and flagitious, in consequence of their\ntransgressions, that their families remain destitute of Divine grace for\nmany generations, who can bring any accusation against God for this most\nrighteous instance of his vengeance? But it will be said, the Lord\ndeclares, on the contrary, that the punishment of the sin of the father\nshall not be transferred to the son. Observe the subject that is treated\nof in that place. The Israelites, after they had been long harassed by\nnumerous and unceasing calamities, began to use this proverb, “The fathers\nhave eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge;”(840) by\nwhich they insinuated, that sins had been committed by their parents, the\npunishment of which was inflicted on them who were otherwise righteous and\ninnocent, more through the implacable wrath of God, than through a just\nseverity. The Prophet announces to them that this is not the case, but\nthat they are punished for their own transgressions, and that it is\nincompatible with the Divine justice to punish a righteous son for the\niniquity of a wicked father. Nor is this to be found in the penal sanction\nnow under consideration. For if the visitation, of which we are treating,\nbe fulfilled, when God removes from the family of the impious his grace,\nthe light of his truth, and the other means of salvation, the very\ncircumstance of children blinded and abandoned by him being found treading\nin the footsteps of their fathers, is an instance of their bearing the\ncurse in consequence of the crimes of their parents. But their being the\nsubjects of temporal miseries, and at length of eternal perdition, are\npunishments from the righteous judgment of God, not for the sins of\nothers, but on account of their own iniquity.\nXXI. On the other hand, God gives a promise to extend his mercy to a\nthousand generations; which also frequently occurs in the Scripture, and\nis inserted in the solemn covenant with the Church: “I will be a God unto\nthee, and to thy seed after thee.”(841) In allusion to this, Solomon says,\nthat “the children of the just man are blessed after him;”(842) not only\nas the effect of a religious education, which is of no small importance,\nbut also in consequence of the blessing promised in the covenant, that the\ngrace of God shall perpetually remain in the families of the pious. This\nis a source of peculiar consolation to the faithful, but to the impious of\ngreat terror; for if, even after death, the memory of righteousness and\niniquity has so much influence with God, that the curse of the one and the\nblessing of the other will redound to posterity, much more will it remain\non the persons of the actors themselves. Now, it is no objection to our\nargument, that the descendants of the impious sometimes grow better, while\nthose of the faithful degenerate; since the Legislator never intended to\nestablish in this case such an invariable rule, as would derogate from his\nown free choice. For it is sufficient for the consolation of the righteous\nand the terror of the sinner, that the denunciation is not vain or\ninefficacious, although it be not always executed. For as the temporal\npunishments inflicted on a few wicked men are testimonies of the Divine\nwrath against sin, and of the judgment that will hereafter be pronounced\non all sinners, though many escape with impunity even to the end of their\nlives, so, when the Lord exhibits one example of this blessing, in\nmanifesting his mercy and goodness to the son for the sake of his father,\nhe affords a proof of his constant and perpetual favour to his\nworshippers; and when, in any one instance, he pursues the iniquity of the\nfather in the son, he shows what a judgment awaits all the reprobate on\naccount of their own transgressions; the certainty of which was what he\nprincipally designed in this passage. He also gives us a cursory\nintimation of the greatness of his mercy, which he extends to a thousand\ngenerations, while he has assigned only four generations to his vengeance.\nThe Third Commandment.\n_Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain._\nXXII. The end of this precept is, that the Lord will have the majesty of\nhis name to be held inviolably sacred by us. The substance of the command\ntherefore is, that we ought not to profane that name by a contemptuous or\nirreverent use of it. This prohibition necessarily implies an injunction,\nthat we studiously and carefully treat it with religious veneration.\nTherefore it becomes us to regulate our thoughts and words in such a\nmanner that we may not think or speak any thing concerning God and his\nmysteries, but with the greatest sobriety and reverence; that in\nmeditating on his works we may form no opinion that is dishonourable to\nhim. These three things, I say, we ought most carefully to observe—first,\nthat whatever we think, and whatever we say of him, should savour of his\nexcellence, correspond to the sacred sublimity of his name, and tend to\nthe exaltation of his magnificence. Secondly, we should not rashly and\npreposterously abuse his holy word and adorable mysteries to the purposes\nof ambition, of avarice, or of amusement; but as they bear an impression\nof the dignity of his name, they should always receive from us the honour\nand esteem which belong to them. Lastly, we should not injure his works by\nobloquy or detraction, as some miserable mortals are accustomed to do; but\nwhenever we mention any thing done by him, we should celebrate it with\nencomiums of wisdom, justice, and goodness. This is “sanctifying” the name\nof God. In every other case, it is violated by a vain and criminal abuse,\nbecause it is carried beyond the limits of that legitimate use, to which\nalone it is consecrated; and though no other consequence ensue, it is\ndeprived of its dignity, and by degrees rendered contemptible. But if it\nbe so criminal thus rashly and unseasonably to introduce the name of God\non every occasion, much more so must it be to apply it to such nefarious\nuses as they do, who make it subservient to the superstitions of\nnecromancy, to horrible imprecations, to unlawful exorcisms, and to other\nimpious incantations. But an oath is the thing principally contemplated in\nthe command, as the most detestable instance of the perverse abuse of the\nDivine name; and this is done to inspire us with the greater horror of\nevery species of profanation of it. That this precept relates to the\nworship of God and the reverence of his name, and not to the equity that\nought to be observed among mankind, appears from this—that the subsequent\ncondemnation, in the second table, of perjury and false witness, by which\nsociety is injured, would be a needless repetition, if the present precept\nrelated to a civil duty. Besides, the division of the law requires this;\nfor, as we have already observed, it is not in vain that God has\ndistributed the law into two tables. Whence we conclude, that in this\ncommand he vindicates his just claims, and guards the sanctity of his\nname, but does not teach the duties which men owe to each other.\nXXIII. In the first place, we have to explain what an oath is. It consists\nin calling upon God as a witness, to confirm the truth of any declaration\nthat we make. For execrations, which contain manifest reproaches against\nGod, are not worthy to be mentioned among oaths. That such an attestation,\nwhen rightly performed, is a species of Divine worship, is evident from\nmany places of Scripture; as when Isaiah prophesies of the vocation of the\nAssyrians and Egyptians to participate in the covenant with Israel. “They\nshall speak,” says he, “the language of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of\nhosts.”(843) By “swearing to the Lord” here is intended making a\nprofession of religion. Again, when he speaks of the extension of his\nkingdom: “He who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the\nGod of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of\ntruth.”(844) Jeremiah says, “If they will diligently learn the ways of my\npeople, to swear by my name, The Lord liveth; as they taught my people to\nswear by Baal, then shall they be built in the midst of my people.”(845)\nAnd we are justly said to profess our religion to the Lord, when we invoke\nhis name to bear witness to us. For thereby we confess that he is truth\nitself, eternal and immutable; whom we call not only as a witness of the\ntruth, excelling all others, but also as the only defender of it, who is\nable to bring to light things which are concealed, and in a word, as the\nsearcher of all hearts. For where human testimonies are wanting, we resort\nfor refuge to the testimony of God; and particularly when any thing is to\nbe affirmed, which is hidden in the conscience. For which reason the Lord\nis extremely angry with them who swear by strange gods, and interprets\nthat species of swearing as a proof of manifest defection from him. “Thy\nchildren have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods.”(846) And\nhe declares the atrociousness of this crime by his denunciation of\npunishment: “I will cut off them that swear by the Lord, and that swear by\nMalcham.”(847)\nXXIV. Now, since we understand it to be the will of the Lord, that we\nshould reverence his name in our oaths, we ought to use so much the more\ncaution, lest, instead of reverence, they betray dishonour or contempt of\nit. It is no trifling insult to him, when perjury is committed in his\nname; and therefore the law calls it a profanation.(848) But what remains\nto the Lord, when he is despoiled of his truth? he will then cease to be\nGod. But he is certainly despoiled of it, when he is made an abettor and\napprover of a falsehood. Wherefore, when Joshua would induce Achan to a\nconfession of the truth, he says, “My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the\nLord God of Israel;”(849) implying in this that the Lord is grievously\ndishonoured, if perjury be committed in his name. Nor is this strange; for\nin such a case we do all that is in our power to brand his sacred name\nwith a falsehood. And that this form of expression was customary among the\nJews, whenever any man was called to take an oath, appears from a similar\nadjuration used by the Pharisees in the Gospel of John.(850) To this\ncaution we are accustomed by the forms of oaths which are used in the\nScriptures: “The Lord liveth;”(851) “God do so and more also to me;”(852)\n“I call God for a record upon my soul;”(853) which imply, that we cannot\ninvoke God to be a witness to our declarations, without imprecating his\nvengeance upon us if we be guilty of perjury.\nXXV. The name of God is rendered vile and contemptible, when it is used in\nunnecessarily swearing even to what is true; for in this instance also it\nis taken in vain. Wherefore it will not be sufficient to abstain from\nperjury; unless we also remember, that swearing is permitted and\nappointed, not for the sake of our pleasure or caprice, but from\nnecessity; and that the lawful use of it, therefore, is transgressed by\nthose who apply it to cases where it is not necessary. Now, no other\nnecessity can be pretended, but when we want to serve either religion or\ncharity. This crime, in the present day, is carried to a very great\nextent; and it is so much the more intolerable, since by its frequency it\nhas ceased to be considered as a crime, though before the Divine tribunal\nit is deemed no trivial offence. For the name of God is universally\nprofaned without concern in trifling conversations; and it is not\nconsidered as sinful, because this presumptuous wickedness has been so\nlong practised with impunity. But the Divine command remains valid; the\nsanction remains firm; and a future day will witness the completion of\nthat part of it which denounces a particular punishment against those who\ntake his name in vain. This precept is violated also in another way. If in\nour oaths we substitute the servants of God in the place of God himself,\nwe are guilty of manifest impiety; because we thereby transfer to them the\nglory due to the Deity. Nor is it without reason, that God, by a special\ncommand, enjoins us to swear by his name,(854) and by a special\nprohibition interdicts us from swearing by any strange gods.(855) And the\nApostle evidently attests the same, when he says, that “men swear by the\ngreater, but that God, because he could swear by no greater, sware by\nhimself.”(856)\nXXVI. The Anabaptists, not satisfied with this limitation of oaths,\ncondemn all oaths without exception; because the prohibition of Christ is\ngeneral: “I say unto you, Swear not at all. But let your communication be,\nYea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of\nevil.”(857) But by this mode of interpretation they set Christ in\nopposition to the Father, as though he descended into this world to\nabrogate the Father’s decrees. For in the law the eternal God not only\npermits an oath, as a lawful thing, which would be sufficient to justify\nthe use of it, but in cases of necessity commands it.(858) Now, Christ\nasserts, that “he and his Father are one,” that “he acts only according to\nthe commands of the Father,” that “his doctrine is not of himself,”\n&c.(859) What then? Will they make God to contradict himself, by\nprohibiting and condemning in our conduct that which he has before\napproved and enjoined? But as the words of Christ involve some difficulty,\nlet us enter on a brief examination of them. Here we shall never arrive at\nthe truth, unless we attend to the design of Christ, and advert to the\nsubject of which he is there treating. His design is not to relax or to\nrestrict the law, but to reduce it to its true and genuine meaning, which\nhad been very much corrupted by the false comments of the scribes and\nPharisees. If we bear this in our minds, we shall not be of opinion that\nChrist condemned all oaths, but only those which transgress the rule of\nthe law. It appears to have been the custom of the people at that time to\navoid nothing but perjuries; whereas the law forbids not only perjuries,\nbut likewise all vain and superfluous oaths. Our Lord, therefore, that\ninfallible expositor of the law, apprizes them that it is sinful, not only\nto perjure themselves, but even to swear. To swear in what manner? In\nvain. But the oaths which are sanctioned in the law he leaves without any\nobjection. They consider themselves as urging a very powerful argument,\nwhen they violently insist on the particle _at all_; which, nevertheless,\nrefers not to the word _swear_, but to the forms of oaths that are there\nsubjoined. For the error there condemned consisted, partly, in a\nsupposition that in swearing by heaven and earth, there was no\ninterference with the name of God. Therefore, after the principal instance\nof transgression, the Lord goes on to destroy all their subterfuges, that\nthey may not imagine themselves to have escaped by suppressing the name of\nGod, and calling heaven and earth to witness for them. For here, by the\nway, it must be remarked, that men indirectly swear by God, though his\nname is not expressed; as when they swear by the light of life, by the\nbread which they eat, by their baptism, or by any other blessings which\nthey have received from the Divine munificence. Nor does Christ in that\nplace prohibit them from swearing by heaven, and earth, and Jerusalem, in\norder to correct superstition, as some falsely imagine; but rather to\nconfute the sophistical subtlety of persons who thought there was no crime\nin the foolish use of indirect oaths, as though they were not chargeable\nwith profaning the sacred name of God, which is engraven, however, on all\nhis benefits. But the case is different, where any mortal man, or one that\nis dead, or an angel, is substituted in the place of God; as, among\nidolatrous nations, adulation invented that odious form of swearing by the\nlife or genius of a king; because in such cases the deification of a\ncreature obscures and diminishes the glory of the only true God. But when\nwe mean nothing but to derive a confirmation to our assertions from the\nsacred name of God, although it be done in an indirect manner, yet all\nsuch frivolous oaths are offensive to his majesty. Christ deprives this\nlicentious practice of every vain excuse, by his prohibition of swearing\nat all. James also aims at the same point,(860) where he uses the language\nof Christ, which I have cited; because this presumption has always been\nprevalent in the world, notwithstanding it is a profanation of the name of\nGod. For if you refer the particle _at all_ to the substance of swearing,\nas though every oath, without exception, were unlawful, what means the\nexplanation which is immediately annexed, “Neither by heaven, neither by\nearth,” &c., language evidently used in refutation of those cavils, which\nthe Jews considered as furnishing an excuse for their sin.\nXXVII. It can no longer be doubtful, therefore, to persons of sound\njudgment, that the Lord, in that passage, only condemns those oaths which\nhad been forbidden by the law. For even he, who exhibited in his life an\nexample of the perfection which he inculcated, hesitated not to make use\nof oaths whenever occasion required; and his disciples, who, we doubt not,\nwere obedient to their master in all things, followed the same example.\nWho can dare to assert, that Paul would have sworn, if all oaths had been\nprohibited? But when the occasion requires it, he swears without any\nscruple, and sometimes even adds an imprecation. The question, however, is\nnot yet decided; for it is the opinion of some persons, that public oaths\nare the only exceptions from this prohibition; such as we take when\nrequired by a magistrate; such also as princes are accustomed to use in\nratifying treaties; or subjects, when they swear allegiance to their\nprinces; or soldiers, as a military test; and others of a similar kind. To\nthis class also they justly refer those oaths which we find used by Paul\nin assertion of the dignity of the gospel; because the Apostles, in the\nexercise of their functions, were not private persons, but public\nministers of God. And indeed I will not deny that these are the safest\noaths; because they are sanctioned by the strongest testimonies of\nScripture. A magistrate is directed, in a dubious case, to put a witness\nto his oath, and the witness, on the other hand, is required to answer on\nhis oath; and the Apostle says, that human controversies are adjusted by\nthis expedient.(861) In this precept both parties are furnished with a\ncomplete justification of their conduct. Moreover we may observe, that\namong the ancient heathen a public and solemn oath was held in great\nreverence; but that common ones, which they used in their ordinary\nintercourse, were not esteemed of any, or of much importance, because they\nimagined that these were not regarded by the Divine majesty. But it would\nbe too dangerous to condemn private oaths, which are taken, in cases of\nnecessity, with sobriety, integrity, and reverence, since they are\nsupported both by reason and by scriptural examples. For if it be lawful\nfor private persons in an important and serious affair to appeal to God as\na judge between them, much more must it be allowable to invoke him as a\nwitness. Your brother will accuse you of perfidy; you endeavour to\nexculpate yourself; he will not permit himself by any means to be\nsatisfied. If your reputation be endangered by his obstinate malignity,\nyou may, without any offence, appeal to the judgment of God, that in his\nown time he will manifest your innocence. If the words be strictly\nexamined, it is a less thing to appeal to him as a witness than as a\njudge. I see not, therefore, why we should assert such an appeal to him to\nbe unlawful. There are not wanting numerous examples of it. If the oath of\nAbraham and Isaac with Abimelech be alleged to have been taken in a public\ncapacity, certainly Jacob and Laban were private persons, and yet they\nconfirmed the covenant between them by a mutual oath.(862) Boaz was a\nprivate person, who confirmed in the same manner his promise of marriage\nto Ruth.(863) Obadiah was a private person, a righteous man, and one that\nfeared the Lord, who declared with an oath the fact of which he wished to\nconvince Elijah.(864) I can find, therefore, no better rule, than that we\nregulate our oaths in such a manner, that they be not rash or\ninconsiderate, wanton or frivolous, but used in cases of real necessity,\nas for vindicating the glory of the Lord, or promoting the edification of\nour brother; which is the end of this commandment of the law.\nThe Fourth Commandment.\n_Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou\nlabour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the sabbath of\nthe Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, &c._\nXXVIII. The end of this precept is, that, being dead to our own affections\nand works, we should meditate on the kingdom of God, and be exercised in\nthat meditation in the observance of his institutions. But, as it has an\naspect peculiar and distinct from the others, it requires a little\ndifferent kind of exposition. The fathers frequently call it a _shadowy\ncommandment_, because it contains the external observance of the day,\nwhich was abolished with the rest of the figures at the advent of Christ.\nAnd there is much truth in their observation; but it reaches only half of\nthe subject. Wherefore it is necessary to seek further for an exposition,\nand to consider three causes, on which I think I have observed this\ncommandment to rest. For it was the design of the heavenly Lawgiver, under\nthe rest of the seventh day, to give the people of Israel a figure of the\nspiritual rest, by which the faithful ought to refrain from their own\nworks, in order to leave God to work within them. His design was,\nsecondly, that there should be a stated day, on which they might assemble\ntogether to hear the law and perform the ceremonies, or at least which\nthey might especially devote to meditations on his works; that by this\nrecollection they might be led to the exercises of piety. Thirdly, he\nthought it right that servants, and persons living under the jurisdiction\nof others, should be indulged with a day of rest, that they might enjoy\nsome remission from their labour.\nXXIX. Yet we are taught in many places that this adumbration of the\nspiritual rest was the principal design of the sabbath. For the Lord is\nhardly so strict in his requisitions of obedience to any other\nprecept.(865) When he means to intimate, in the Prophets, that religion is\ntotally subverted, he complains that his sabbaths are polluted, violated,\nneglected, and profaned;(866) as though, in case of that duty being\nneglected, there remained no other way in which he could be honoured. On\nthe other hand, he notices the observance of it with singular encomiums.\nWherefore also, among the other Divine communications, the faithful used\nvery highly to esteem the revelation of the sabbath. For this is the\nlanguage of the Levites in a solemn assembly, recorded by Nehemiah: “Thou\nmadest known unto our fathers thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them\nprecepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses.”(867) We see the\nsingular estimation in which it is held above all the commandments of the\nlaw. All these things tend to display the dignity of the mystery, which is\nbeautifully expressed by Moses and Ezekiel. In Exodus we read as follows:\n“Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between me and you\nthroughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth\nsanctify you. Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto\nyou. The children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath\nthroughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign\nbetween me and the children of Israel for ever.”(868) This is more fully\nexpressed by Ezekiel; but the substance of what he says is, that the\nsabbath was a sign by which the Israelites might know that God was their\nsanctifier.(869) If our sanctification consists properly in the\nmortification of our own will, there is a very natural analogy between the\nexternal sign and the internal thing which it represents. We must rest\naltogether, that God may operate within us; we must recede from our own\nwill, resign our own heart, and renounce all our carnal affections; in\nshort, we must cease from all the efforts of our own understanding, that\nhaving God operating within us, we may enjoy rest in him, as we are also\ntaught by the Apostle.(870)\nXXX. This perpetual cessation was represented to the Jews by the\nobservance of one day in seven, which the Lord, in order that it might be\nthe more religiously kept, recommended by his own example. For it is no\nsmall stimulus to any action, for a man to know that he is imitating his\nCreator. If any one inquire after a hidden signification in the septenary\nnumber, it is probable, that because in Scripture it is the number of\nperfection, it is here selected to denote perpetual duration. This is\nconfirmed also by the circumstance, that Moses, with that day in which he\nnarrates that the Lord rested from his works, concludes his description of\nthe succession of days and nights. We may also adduce another probable\nconjecture respecting this number—that the Lord intended to signify that\nthe sabbath would never be completed until the arrival of the last day.\nFor in it we begin that blessed rest, in which we make new advances from\nday to day. But because we are still engaged in a perpetual warfare with\nthe flesh, it will not be consummated before the completion of that\nprediction of Isaiah, “It shall come to pass, that from one new moon to\nanother, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship\nbefore me, saith the Lord;”(871) that is, when God shall be “all in\nall.”(872) The Lord may be considered, therefore, as having delineated to\nhis people, in the seventh day, the future perfection of his sabbath in\nthe last day, that, by a continual meditation on the sabbath during their\nwhole life, they might be aspiring towards this perfection.\nXXXI. If any one disapprove of this observation on the number, as too\ncurious, I object not to its being understood in a more simple manner;\nthat the Lord ordained a certain day, that the people under the discipline\nof the law might be exercised in continual meditations on the spiritual\nrest; that he appointed the seventh day, either because he foresaw it\nwould be sufficient, or in order that the proposal of a resemblance to his\nown example might operate as a stronger stimulus to the people, or at\nleast to apprize them that the only end of the sabbath was to promote\ntheir conformity to their Creator. For this is of little importance,\nprovided we retain the mystery, which is principally exhibited, of a\nperpetual rest from our own works. To the contemplation of this, the\nProphets used frequently to recall the Jews, that they might not suppose\nthemselves to have discharged their duty merely by a cessation from manual\nlabours. Beside the passages already cited, we have the following in\nIsaiah: “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy\npleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the\nLord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor\nfinding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words; then shalt thou\ndelight thyself in the Lord,” &c.(873) But all that it contained of a\nceremonial nature was without doubt abolished by the advent of the Lord\nChrist. For he is the truth, at whose presence all figures disappear; the\nbody, at the sight of which all the shadows are relinquished. He, I say,\nis the true fulfilment of the sabbath. Having been “buried with him by\nbaptism, we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, that\nbeing partakers of his resurrection, we may walk in newness of life.”(874)\nTherefore the Apostle says in another place, that “the sabbath was a\nshadow of things to come; but the _body_ is of Christ;”(875) that is, the\nreal substance of the truth, which he has beautifully explained in that\npassage. This is contained not in one day, but in the whole course of our\nlife, till, being wholly dead to ourselves, we be filled with the life of\nGod. Christians therefore ought to depart from all superstitious\nobservance of days.\nXXXII. As the two latter causes, however, ought not to be numbered among\nthe ancient shadows, but are equally suitable to all ages,—though the\nsabbath is abrogated, yet it is still customary among us to assemble on\nstated days for hearing the word, for breaking the mystic bread, and for\npublic prayers; and also to allow servants and labourers a remission from\ntheir labour. That in commanding the sabbath, the Lord had regard to both\nthese things, cannot be doubted. The first is abundantly confirmed even by\nthe practice of the Jews. The second is proved by Moses, in Deuteronomy,\nin these words: “that thy man‐servant and thy maid‐servant may rest as\nwell as thou. And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of\nEgypt.”(876) Also, in Exodus: “that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and\nthe son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.”(877) Who can\ndeny that both these things are as proper for us as for the Jews?\nAssemblies of the Church are enjoined in the Divine word, and the\nnecessity of them is sufficiently known even from the experience of life.\nUnless there be stated days appointed for them, how can they be held?\nAccording to the direction of the Apostle, “all things” are to “be done\ndecently and in order” among us.(878) But so far is it from being possible\nto preserve order and decorum without this regulation, that, if it were\nabolished, the Church would be in imminent danger of immediate convulsion\nand ruin. But if we feel the same necessity, to relieve which the Lord\nenjoined the sabbath upon the Jews, let no one plead that it does not\nbelong to us. For our most provident and indulgent Father has been no less\nattentive to provide for our necessity than for that of the Jews. But why,\nit may be asked, do we not rather assemble on every day, that so all\ndistinction of days may be removed? I sincerely wish that this were\npractised; and truly spiritual wisdom would be well worthy of some portion\nof time being daily allotted to it; but if the infirmity of many persons\nwill not admit of daily assemblies, and charity does not permit us to\nrequire more of them, why should we not obey the rule which we have\nimposed upon us by the will of God?\nXXXIII. I am obliged to be rather more diffuse on this point, because, in\nthe present age, some unquiet spirits have been raising noisy contentions\nrespecting the Lord’s day. They complain that Christians are tinctured\nwith Judaism, because they retain any observance of days. But I reply,\nthat the Lord’s day is not observed by us upon the principles of Judaism;\nbecause in this respect the difference between us and the Jews is very\ngreat. For we celebrate it not with scrupulous rigour, as a ceremony which\nwe conceive to be a figure of some spiritual mystery, but only use it as a\nremedy necessary to the preservation of order in the Church. But they say,\nPaul teaches that Christians are not to be judged in the observance of it,\nbecause it is a shadow of something future.(879) Therefore he is “afraid\nlest” he has “bestowed” on the Galatians “labour in vain,” because they\ncontinued to “observe days.”(880) And in the Epistle to the Romans, he\nasserts him to be “weak in the faith,” who “esteemeth one day above\nanother.”(881) But who, these furious zealots only excepted, does not see\nwhat observance the apostle intends? For they did not observe them for the\nsake of political and ecclesiastical order; but when they retained them as\nshadows of spiritual things, they were so far guilty of obscuring the\nglory of Christ and the light of the gospel. They did not, therefore, rest\nfrom their manual labours, as from employments which would divert them\nfrom sacred studies and meditations; but from a principle of superstition,\nimagining their cessation from labour to be still an expression of\nreverence for the mysteries formerly represented by it. This preposterous\ndistinction of days the Apostle strenuously opposes; and not that\nlegitimate difference which promotes the peace of the Christian Church.\nFor in the churches which he founded, the sabbath was retained for this\npurpose. He prescribes the same day to the Corinthians, for making\ncollections for the relief of the brethren at Jerusalem. If superstition\nbe an object of fear, there was more danger in the holy days of the Jews,\nthan in the Lord’s days now observed by Christians. Now, whereas it was\nexpedient for the destruction of superstition, the day which the Jews kept\nholy was abolished; and it being necessary for the preservation of\ndecorum, order, and peace, in the Christian Church, another day was\nappointed for the same use.\nXXXIV. However, the ancients have not without sufficient reason\nsubstituted what we call the Lord’s day in the room of the sabbath. For\nsince the resurrection of the Lord is the end and consummation of that\ntrue rest, which was adumbrated by the ancient sabbath, the same day which\nput an end to the shadows, admonishes Christians not to adhere to a\nshadowy ceremony. Yet I do not lay so much stress on the septenary number,\nthat I would oblige the Church to an invariable adherence to it; nor will\nI condemn those churches which have other solemn days for their\nassemblies, provided they keep at a distance from superstition. And this\nwill be the case, if they be only designed for the observance of\ndiscipline and well‐regulated order. Let us sum up the whole in the\nfollowing manner: As the truth was delivered to the Jews under a figure,\nso it is given to us without any shadows; first, in order that during our\nwhole life we should meditate on a perpetual rest from our own works, that\nthe Lord may operate within us by his Spirit; secondly, that every man,\nwhenever he has leisure, should diligently exercise himself in private in\npious reflections on the works of God, and also that we should at the same\ntime observe the legitimate order of the Church, appointed for the hearing\nof the word, for the administration of the sacraments, and for public\nprayer; thirdly, that we should not unkindly oppress those who are subject\nto us. Thus vanish all the dreams of false prophets, who in past ages have\ninfected the people with a Jewish notion, affirming that nothing but the\nceremonial part of this commandment, which, according to them, is the\nappointment of the seventh day, has been abrogated, but that the moral\npart of it, that is, the observance of one day in seven, still remains.\nBut this is only changing the day in contempt of the Jews, while they\nretain the same opinion of the holiness of a day; for on this principle\nthe same mysterious signification would still be attributed to particular\ndays, which they formerly obtained among the Jews. And indeed we see what\nadvantages have arisen from such a sentiment. For those who adhere to it,\nfar exceed the Jews in a gross, carnal, and superstitious observance of\nthe sabbath; so that the reproofs, which we find in Isaiah, are equally\napplicable to them in the present age, as to those whom the Prophet\nreproved in his time. But the principal thing to be remembered is the\ngeneral doctrine; that, lest religion decay or languish among us, sacred\nassemblies ought diligently to be held, and that we ought to use those\nexternal means which are adapted to support the worship of God.\nThe Fifth Commandment.\n_Honour thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon\nthe land which the Lord thy God giveth thee._\nXXXV. The end of this precept is, that since the Lord God desires the\npreservation of the order he has appointed, the degrees of preëminence\nfixed by him ought to be inviolably preserved. The sum of it, therefore,\nwill be, that we should reverence them whom God has exalted to any\nauthority over us, and should render them honour, obedience, and\ngratitude. Whence follows a prohibition to derogate from their dignity by\ncontempt, obstinacy, or ingratitude. For in the Scripture the word\n“honour” has an extensive signification; as, when the Apostle directs that\n“the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honour,”(882) he\nmeans not only that they are entitled to reverence, but likewise such a\nremuneration as their ministry deserves. But as this precept, which\nenjoins subjection to superiors, is exceedingly repugnant to the depravity\nof human nature, whose ardent desire of exaltation will scarcely admit of\nsubjection, it has therefore proposed as an example that kind of\nsuperiority which is naturally most amiable and least invidious; because\nthat might the more easily mollify and incline our minds to a habit of\nsubmission. By that subjection, therefore, which is most easy to be borne,\nthe Lord accustoms us by degrees to every kind of legitimate obedience;\nbecause the reason of all is the same. For to those, to whom he gives any\npreëminence, he communicates his own authority, as far as is necessary for\nthe preservation of that preëminence. The titles of Father, God, and Lord,\nare so eminently applicable to him, that, whenever we hear either of them\nmentioned, our minds cannot but be strongly affected with a sense of his\nmajesty. Those, therefore, on whom he bestows these titles, he illuminates\nwith a ray of his splendour, to render them all honourable in their\nrespective stations. Thus in a father we ought to recognize something\nDivine; for it is not without reason that he bears one of the titles of\nthe Deity. Our prince, or our lord, enjoys an honour somewhat similar to\nthat which is given to God.\nXXXVI. Wherefore it ought not to be doubted that God here lays down a\nuniversal rule for our conduct; namely, that to every one, whom we know to\nbe placed in authority over us by his appointment, we should render\nreverence, obedience, gratitude, and all the other services in our power.\nNor does it make any difference, whether they are worthy of this honour,\nor not. For whatever be their characters, yet it is not without the\nappointment of the Divine providence, that they have attained that\nstation, on account of which the supreme Legislator has commanded them to\nbe honoured. He has particularly enjoined reverence to our parents, who\nhave brought us into this life; which nature itself ought to teach us. For\nthose who violate the parental authority by contempt or rebellion, are not\nmen, but monsters. Therefore the Lord commands all those, who are\ndisobedient to their parents, to be put to death, as having rendered\nthemselves unworthy to enjoy the light, by their disregard of those by\nwhose means they were introduced to it. And various appendices to the law\nevince the truth of our observation, that the honour here intended\nconsists in reverence, obedience, and gratitude. The first the Lord\nconfirms, when he commands him to be slain who has cursed his father or\nmother;(883) for in that case he punishes contempt. He confirms the\nsecond, when he denounces the punishment of death against disobedient and\nrebellious children.(884) The third is supported by Christ, who says, “God\ncommanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother;” and, “He that curseth\nfather or mother, let him die the death. But ye say, Whosoever shall say\nto his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be\nprofited by me; and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.\nThus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your\ntradition.”(885) And whenever Paul mentions this commandment, he explains\nit as a requisition of obedience.(886)\nXXXVII. In order to recommend it, a promise is annexed, which is a further\nintimation how acceptable to God that submission is which is here\nenjoined. Paul employs that stimulus to arouse our inattention, when he\nsays, “This is the first commandment with promise.” For the preceding\npromise, in the first table, was not particularly confined to one\ncommandment, but extended to the whole law. Now, the true explanation of\nthis promise is, that the Lord spake particularly to the Israelites\nconcerning the land which he had promised them as an inheritance. If the\npossession of that land therefore was a pledge of the Divine goodness, we\nneed not wonder, if it was the Lord’s will to manifest his favour by\nbestowing length of life, in order to prolong the enjoyment of the\nblessing conferred by him. The meaning of it therefore is, Honour thy\nfather and thy mother, that through the space of a long life thou mayest\nenjoy the possession of the land, which will be to thee a testimony of my\nfavour. But, as the whole earth is blessed to the faithful, we justly\nplace the present life among the blessings we receive from God. Wherefore\nthis promise belongs likewise to us, inasmuch as the continuance of the\npresent life affords us a proof of the Divine benevolence. For neither is\nit promised to us, nor was it promised to the Jews, as though it contained\nany blessedness in itself; but because to the pious it is generally a\ntoken of the Divine favour. Therefore, if a son, that is obedient to his\nparents, happen to be removed out of life before the age of\nmaturity,—which is a case of frequent occurrence,—the Lord, nevertheless,\nperseveres with as much punctuality in the completion of his promise, as\nif he were to reward a person with a hundred acres of land to whom he had\nonly promised one. The whole consists in this: We should consider that\nlong life is promised to us so far as it is the blessing of God; but that\nit is a blessing, only as it is a proof of the favour of God, which he\ninfinitely more richly and substantially testifies and actually\ndemonstrates to his servants in their death.\nXXXVIII. Moreover, when the Lord promises the blessing of the present life\nto those children who honour their parents with proper reverence, he at\nthe same time implies that a certain curse impends over all those who are\ndisobedient and perverse. And that it might not fail of being executed, he\npronounces them in his law to be liable to the sentence of death, and\ncommands that punishment to be inflicted on them. If they escape that, he\npunishes them himself in some other way. For we see what great numbers of\npersons of this character fall in battles and in private quarrels; others\nare afflicted in unusual ways; and almost all of them are proofs of the\ntruth of this threatening. But if any arrive at an extreme age, being\ndeprived of the Divine blessing, they only languish in misery in this\nlife, and are reserved to greater punishments hereafter; and consequently\nthey are far from participating in the blessing promised to dutiful\nchildren. But it must be remarked by the way, that we are commanded to\nobey them only “in the Lord;” and this is evident from the foundation\nbefore laid; for they preside in that station to which the Lord has\nexalted them by communicating to them a portion of his honour. Wherefore\nthe submission exercised towards them ought to be a step towards honouring\nthe Supreme Father. Therefore, if they instigate us to any transgression\nof the law, we may justly consider them not as parents, but as strangers,\nwho attempt to seduce us from obedience to our real Father. The same\nobservation is applicable to princes, lords, and superiors of every\ndescription. For it is infamous and absurd, that their eminence should\navail to depreciate the preëminence of God, upon which it depends, and to\nwhich it ought to conduct us.\nThe Sixth Commandment.\n_Thou shalt not kill._\nXXXIX. The end of this precept is, that since God has connected mankind\ntogether in a kind of unity, every man ought to consider himself as\ncharged with the safety of all. In short, then, all violence and\ninjustice, and every kind of mischief, which may injure the body of our\nneighbour, are forbidden to us. And therefore we are enjoined, if it be in\nour power, to assist in protecting the lives of our neighbours; to exert\nourselves with fidelity for this purpose; to procure those things which\nconduce to their tranquillity; to be vigilant in shielding them from\ninjuries; and in cases of danger to afford them our assistance. If we\nremember that this is the language of the Divine Legislator, we should\nconsider, at the same time, that he intends this rule to govern the soul.\nFor it were ridiculous, that he who beholds the thoughts of the heart, and\nprincipally insists on them, should content himself with forming only the\nbody to true righteousness. Mental homicide, therefore, is likewise\nprohibited, and an internal disposition to preserve the life of our\nbrother is commanded in this law. The hand, indeed, accomplishes the\nhomicide, but it is conceived by the mind under the influence of anger and\nhatred. Examine whether you can be angry with your brother, without being\ninflamed with a desire of doing him some injury. If you cannot be angry\nwith him, then you cannot hate him; for hatred is nothing more than\ninveterate anger. However you may dissemble, and endeavour to extricate\nyourself by vain subterfuges, whenever there is either anger or hatred,\nthere is also a disposition to do injury. If you persist in your evasions,\nit is already pronounced by the Holy Spirit, that “Whosoever hateth his\nbrother is a murderer.”(887) It is declared by the Lord Christ, “that\nwhosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of\nthe judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in\ndanger of the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in\ndanger of hell fire.”(888)\nXL. Now, the Scripture states two reasons on which this precept is\nfounded; the first, that man is the image of God; the second, that he is\nour own flesh. Wherefore, unless we would violate the image of God, we\nought to hold the personal safety of our neighbour inviolably sacred; and\nunless we would divest ourselves of humanity, we ought to cherish him as\nour own flesh. The motives which are derived from the redemption and grace\nof Christ will be treated in another place. These two characters, which\nare inseparable from the nature of man, God requires us to consider as\nmotives to our exertions for his security; so that we may reverence his\nimage impressed on him, and show an affectionate regard for our own flesh.\nThat person, therefore, is not innocent of the crime of murder, who has\nmerely restrained himself from the effusion of blood. If you perpetrate,\nif you attempt, if you only conceive in your mind any thing inimical to\nthe safety of another, you stand guilty of murder. Unless you also\nendeavour to defend him to the utmost of your ability and opportunity, you\nare guilty of the same inhuman transgression of the law. But if so much\nconcern be discovered for the safety of the body, we may conclude, how\nmuch care and attention should be devoted to the safety of the soul,\nwhich, in the sight of God, is of infinitely superior value.\nThe Seventh Commandment.\n_Thou shalt not commit adultery._\nXLI. The end of this precept is, that because God loves chastity and\npurity, we ought to depart from all uncleanness. The sum of it therefore\nis, that we ought not to be polluted by any carnal impurity, or libidinous\nintemperance. To this prohibition corresponds the affirmative injunction,\nthat every part of our lives ought to be regulated by chastity and\ncontinence. But he expressly forbids adultery, to which all incontinence\ntends; in order that by the turpitude of that which is very gross and\npalpable, being an infamous pollution of the body, he may lead us to\nabominate every unlawful passion. Since man was created in such a state as\nnot to live a solitary life, but to be united to a help‐meet; and moreover\nsince the curse of sin has increased this necessity,—the Lord has afforded\nus ample assistance in this case by the institution of marriage—a\nconnection which he has not only originated by his authority, but also\nsanctified by his blessing. Whence it appears, that every other union, but\nthat of marriage, is cursed in his sight; and that the conjugal union\nitself is appointed as a remedy for our necessity, that we may not break\nout into unrestrained licentiousness. Let us not flatter ourselves,\ntherefore, since we hear that there can be no cohabitation of male and\nfemale, except in marriage, without the curse of God.\nXLII. Now, since the original constitution of human nature, and the\nviolence of the passions consequent upon the fall, have rendered a union\nof the sexes doubly necessary, except to those whom God has exempted from\nthat necessity by peculiar grace, let every one carefully examine what is\ngiven to him. Virginity, I acknowledge, is a virtue not to be despised.\nBut as this is denied to some, and to others is granted only for a season,\nlet those who are troubled with incontinence, and cannot succeed in\nresisting it, avail themselves of the help of marriage, that they may\npreserve their chastity according to the degree of their calling. For\npersons who “cannot receive this saying,”(889) if they do not assist their\nfrailty by the remedy offered and granted to them, oppose God and resist\nhis ordinance. Here let no one object, as many do in the present day, that\nwith the help of God he can do all things. For the assistance of God is\ngranted only to them who walk in his ways, that is, in their calling;\nwhich is deserted by all those who neglect the means which God has\nafforded them, and strive to overcome their necessities by vain\npresumption. That continence is a peculiar gift of God, and of that kind\nwhich is not imparted promiscuously, or to the whole body of the Church,\nbut only conferred on a few of its members, is affirmed by our Lord. For\nhe mentions a certain class of men who “have made themselves eunuchs for\nthe kingdom of heaven’s sake;”(890) that is, that they might be more at\nliberty to devote their attention to the affairs of the kingdom of heaven.\nBut that no one might suppose this to be in the power of man, he had\nalready declared that “all men cannot receive this saying, save they to\nwhom it is given.” And he concludes, “He that is able to receive it, let\nhim receive it.” Paul is still more explicit, when he says, that “every\nman hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after\nthat.”(891)\nXLIII. Since we are so expressly apprized that it is not in the power of\nevery one to preserve chastity in celibacy, even with the most strenuous\nefforts for that purpose, and that it is a peculiar grace, which the Lord\nconfers only on particular persons, that he may have them more ready for\nhis service, do we not resist God, and strive against the nature\ninstituted by him, unless we accommodate our manner of life to the measure\nof our ability? In this commandment the Lord prohibits adultery: therefore\nhe requires of us purity and chastity. The only way of preserving this is,\nthat every one should measure himself by his own capacity. Let no one\nrashly despise marriage as a thing useless or unnecessary to him; let no\none prefer celibacy, unless he can dispense with a wife. And in that state\nlet him not consult his carnal tranquillity or advantage, but only that,\nbeing exempted from this restraint, he may be the more prompt and ready\nfor all the duties of piety. Moreover, as this benefit is conferred upon\nmany persons only for a season, let every one refrain from marriage as\nlong as he shall be capable of supporting a life of celibacy. When his\nstrength fails to overcome his passions, let him consider that the Lord\nhas laid him under a necessity of marrying. This is evident from the\ndirection of the Apostle: “To avoid fornication, let every man have his\nown wife, and let every woman have her own husband.” Again: “If they\ncannot contain, let them marry.”(892) Here, in the first place, he\nsignifies that the majority of men are subject to the vice of\nincontinence; in the next place, of those who are subject to it, he makes\nno exception, but enjoins them all to have recourse to that sole remedy\nwhich obviates unchastity. Those who are incontinent, therefore, if they\nneglect this method of curing their infirmity, are guilty of sin, in not\nobeying this injunction of the Apostle. And let not him who refrains from\nactual fornication, flatter himself, as though he could not be charged\nwith unchastity, while his heart at the same time is inflamed with\nlibidinous desire. For Paul defines chastity to consist in sanctity of\nmind connected with purity of body. “The unmarried woman,” he says,\n“careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and\nin spirit.”(893) Therefore, when he gives a reason to confirm the\npreceding injunction, he does not content himself with saying that it is\nbetter for a man to marry than to pollute himself with the society of a\nharlot, but affirms that “it is better to marry than to burn.”(894)\nXLIV. Now, if married persons are satisfied that their society is attended\nwith the blessing of the Lord, they are thereby admonished that it must\nnot be contaminated by libidinous and dissolute intemperance. For if the\nhonour of marriage conceals the shame of incontinence, it ought not on\nthat account to be made an incitement to it. Wherefore let it not be\nsupposed by married persons that all things are lawful to them. Every man\nshould observe sobriety towards his wife, and every wife, reciprocally,\ntowards her husband; conducting themselves in such a manner as to do\nnothing unbecoming the decorum and temperance of marriage. For thus ought\nmarriage contracted in the Lord to be regulated by moderation and modesty,\nand not to break out into the vilest lasciviousness. Such sensuality has\nbeen stigmatized by Ambrose with a severe, but not unmerited censure, when\nhe calls those who in their conjugal intercourse have no regard to modesty\nor decorum, the adulterers of their own wives. Lastly, let us consider who\nthe Legislator is, by whom adultery is here condemned. It is no other than\nhe who ought to have the entire possession of us, and justly requires the\nwhole of our spirit, soul, and body. Therefore, when he prohibits us from\ncommitting adultery, he at the same time forbids us, either by\nlasciviously ornamenting our persons, or by obscene gesticulations, or by\nimpure expressions, insidiously to attack the chastity of others. For\nthere is much reason in the address of Archelaus to a young man clothed in\nan immoderately effeminate and delicate manner, that it was immaterial in\nwhat part he was immodest, with respect to God, who abominates all\ncontamination, in whatever part it may discover itself, either of soul or\nof body. And that there may be no doubt on the subject, let us remember\nthat God here recommends chastity. If the Lord requires chastity of us, he\ncondemns every thing contrary to it. Wherefore, if we aspire to obedience,\nneither let our mind internally burn with depraved concupiscence, nor let\nour eyes wanton into corrupt affections, nor let our body be adorned for\npurposes of seduction, nor let our tongue with impure speeches allure our\nmind to similar thoughts, nor let us inflame ourselves with intemperance.\nFor all these vices are stains, by which the purity of chastity is\ndefiled.\nThe Eighth Commandment.\n_Thou shalt not steal._\nXLV. The end of this precept is, that, as injustice is an abomination to\nGod, every man may possess what belongs to him. The sum of it, then, is,\nthat we are forbidden to covet the property of others, and are therefore\nenjoined faithfully to use our endeavours to preserve to every man what\njustly belongs to him. For we ought to consider, that what a man possesses\nhas fallen to his lot, not by a fortuitous contingency, but by the\ndistribution of the supreme Lord of all; and that therefore no man can be\ndeprived of his possessions by criminal methods, without an injury being\ndone to the Divine dispenser of them. But the species of theft are\nnumerous. One consists in violence; when the property of any person is\nplundered by force and predatory license. Another consists in malicious\nimposture; when it is taken away in a fraudulent manner. Another consists\nin more secret cunning; where any one is deprived of his property under\nthe mask of justice. Another consists in flatteries; where we are cheated\nunder the pretence of a donation. But not to dwell too long on the recital\nof the different species of theft, let us remember that all artifices by\nwhich the possessions and wealth of our neighbours are transferred to us,\nwhenever they deviate from sincere love into a desire of deceiving, or\ndoing any kind of injury, are to be esteemed acts of theft. This is the\nonly view in which God considers them, even though the property may be\ngained by a suit at law. For he sees the tedious manœuvres with which the\ndesigning man begins to decoy his more simple neighbour, till at length he\nentangles him in his snares. He sees the cruel and inhuman laws, by which\nthe more powerful man oppresses and ruins him that is weaker. He sees the\nbaits with which the more crafty trap the imprudent. All which things are\nconcealed from the judgment of man, nor ever come to his knowledge. And\nthis kind of injury relates not only to money, or to goods, or to lands,\nbut to whatever each individual is justly entitled to; for we defraud our\nneighbours of their property, if we deny them those kind offices, which it\nis our duty to perform to them. If an idle agent or steward devour the\nsubstance of his master, and be inattentive to the care of his domestic\naffairs; if he either improperly waste, or squander with a luxurious\nprofusion, the property intrusted to him; if a servant deride his master,\nif he divulge his secrets, if by any means he betray either his life or\nhis property; and if, on the other hand, a master inhumanly oppress his\nfamily,—God holds him guilty of theft. For the property of others is\nwithheld and misapplied by him, who does not perform towards them those\noffices which the duty of his situation requires of him.\nXLVI. We shall rightly obey this commandment therefore, if, contented with\nour own lot, we seek no gain but in an honest and lawful way; if we\nneither desire to enrich ourselves by injustice, nor attempt to ruin the\nfortune of our neighbour, in order to increase our own; if we do not\nlabour to accumulate wealth by cruelty, and at the expense of the blood of\nothers; if we do not greedily scrape together from every quarter,\nregardless of right or wrong, whatever may conduce to satiate our avarice\nor support our prodigality. On the contrary, it should be our constant\naim, as far as possible, faithfully to assist all by our advice and our\nproperty in preserving what belongs to them; but if we are concerned with\nperfidious and fallacious men, let us be prepared rather to recede a\nlittle from our just right than to contend with them. Moreover, let us\ncommunicate to the necessities, and according to our ability alleviate the\npoverty, of those whom we perceive to be pressed by any embarrassment of\ntheir circumstances. Lastly, let every man examine what obligations his\nduty lays him under to others, and let him faithfully discharge the duties\nwhich he owes them. For this reason the people should honour their\ngovernors, patiently submit to their authority, obey their laws and\nmandates, and resist nothing, to which they can submit consistently with\nthe Divine will. On the other hand, let governors take care of their\npeople, preserve the public peace, protect the good, punish the wicked,\nand administer all things in such a manner, as becomes those who must\nrender an account of their office to God the supreme Judge. Let the\nministers of churches faithfully devote themselves to the ministry of the\nword, and let them never adulterate the doctrine of salvation, but deliver\nit pure and uncontaminated to the people of God. Let them teach, not only\nby their doctrine, but by the example of their lives; in a word, let them\npreside as good shepherds over the sheep. Let the people, on their part,\nreceive them as the messengers and apostles of God, render to them that\nhonour to which the supreme Master has exalted them, and furnish them with\nthe necessaries of life. Let parents undertake the support, government,\nand instruction of their children, as committed by God to their care; nor\nlet them exasperate their minds and alienate their affections from them by\ncruelty, but cherish and embrace them with the lenity and indulgence\nbecoming their character. And that obedience is due to them from their\nchildren has been before observed. Let juniors revere old age, since the\nLord has designed that age to be honourable. Let old men, by their\nprudence and superior experience, guide the imbecility of youth; not\nteasing them with sharp and clamorous invectives, but tempering severity\nwith mildness and affability. Let servants show themselves obedient and\ndiligent in the service of their masters; and that not only in appearance,\nbut from the heart, as serving God himself. Neither let masters behave\nmorosely and perversely to their servants, harassing them with excessive\nasperity, or treating them with contempt; but rather acknowledge them as\ntheir brethren and companions in the service of the heavenly Master,\nentitled to be regarded with mutual affection, and to receive kind\ntreatment. In this manner, I say, let every man consider what duties he\nowes to his neighbours, according to the relations he sustains; and those\nduties let him discharge. Moreover, our attention should always be\ndirected to the Legislator; to remind us that this law is ordained for our\nhearts as much as for our hands, in order that men may study both to\nprotect the property and to promote the interests of others.\nThe Ninth Commandment.\n_Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour._\nXLVII. The end of this precept is, that because God, who is truth itself,\nexecrates a lie, we ought to preserve the truth without the least\ndisguise. The sum of it therefore is, that we neither violate the\ncharacter of any man, either by calumnies or by false accusations, nor\ndistress him in his property by falsehood, nor injure him by detraction or\nimpertinence. This prohibition is connected with an injunction to do all\nthe service we can to every man, by affirming the truth for the protection\nof his reputation and his property. The Lord seems to have intended the\nfollowing words as an exposition of this command: “Thou shalt not raise a\nfalse report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous\nwitness.” Again: “Keep thee far from a false matter.”(895) In another\nplace also he not only forbids us to practise backbiting and tale‐bearing\namong the people, but prohibits every man from deceiving his brother;(896)\nfor he cautions us against both in distinct commandments. Indeed there is\nno doubt but that, as, in the preceding precepts, he has prohibited\ncruelty, impurity, and avarice, so in this he forbids falsehood; of which\nthere are two branches, as we have before observed. For either we\ntransgress against the reputation of our neighbours by malignity and\nperverse detraction, or by falsehood and sometimes by obloquy we injure\ntheir interests. It is immaterial whether we suppose the testimony here\ndesigned to be solemn and judicial, or a common one, which is delivered in\nprivate conversations. For we must always recur to this maxim—that, of\neach of the separate kinds of vices, one species is proposed as an\nexample, to which the rest may be referred; and that, in general, the\nspecies selected is that in which the turpitude of the vice is most\nconspicuous. It is proper, however, to extend it more generally to\ncalumnies and detraction, by which our neighbours are unjustly harassed;\nbecause falsehood in a forensic testimony is always attended with perjury.\nBut perjury, being a profanation and violation of the name of God, has\nalready been sufficiently condemned in the third commandment. Wherefore\nthe legitimate observance of this precept is, that our tongue, by\nasserting the truth, ought to serve both the reputation and the profit of\nour neighbours. The equity of this is self‐evident. For if a good name be\nmore precious than any treasures whatever, a man sustains as great an\ninjury when he is deprived of the integrity of his character, as when he\nis despoiled of his wealth. And in plundering his substance, there is\nsometimes as much effected by false testimony, as by the hands of\nviolence.\nXLVIII. Nevertheless, it is wonderful with what supine security this\nprecept is generally transgressed, so that few persons can be found, who\nare not notoriously subject to this malady; we are so fascinated with the\nmalignant pleasure of examining and detecting the faults of others. Nor\nshould we suppose it to be a sufficient excuse, that in many cases we\ncannot be charged with falsehood. For he who forbids the character of our\nbrother to be bespattered with falsehood, wills also that as far as the\ntruth will permit, it be preserved immaculate. For although he only guards\nit against falsehood, he thereby suggests that it is committed to his\ncharge. But this should be sufficient to induce us to defend the fair\ncharacter of our neighbour—that God concerns himself in its protection.\nWherefore detraction is, without doubt, universally condemned. Now, by\ndetraction we mean, not reproof, which is given from a motive of\ncorrection; not accusation or judicial denunciation, by which recompense\nis demanded for an injury; not public reprehension, which tends to strike\nterror into other offenders; not a discovery to them whose safety depends\non their being previously warned, that they may not be endangered through\nignorance; but odious crimination, which arises from malice, and a violent\npropensity to detraction. This commandment also extends so far as to\nforbid us to affect a pleasantry tinctured with scurrilous and bitter\nsarcasms, severely lashing the faults of others under the appearance of\nsport; which is the practice of some who aim at the praise of raillery, to\nthe prejudice of the modesty and feelings of others; for such wantonness\nsometimes fixes a lasting stigma on the characters of our brethren. Now,\nif we turn our eyes to the Legislator whose proper right it is to rule our\nears and our minds, as much as our tongues, it will certainly appear that\nan avidity of hearing detraction, and an unreasonable propensity to\nunfavourable opinions respecting others, are equally prohibited. For it\nwould be ridiculous for any one to suppose that God hates slander in the\ntongue, and does not reprobate malice in the heart. Wherefore, if we\npossess the true fear and love of God, let us make it our study, that as\nfar as is practicable and expedient, and consistent with charity, we\ndevote neither our tongues nor our ears to opprobrious and malicious\nraillery, nor inadvertently attend to unfavourable suspicions; but that,\nputting fair constructions on every man’s words and actions, we regulate\nour hearts, our ears, and our tongues, with a view to preserve the\nreputation of all around us.\nThe Tenth Commandment.\n_Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet\nthy neighbour’s wife, nor his man‐servant, nor his maid‐servant,\nnor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s._\nXLIX. The end of this precept is, that, since it is the will of God that\nour whole soul should be under the influence of love, every desire\ninconsistent with charity ought to be expelled from our minds. The sum,\nthen, will be, that no thought should obtrude itself upon us, which would\nexcite in our minds any desire that is noxious, and tends to the detriment\nof another. To which corresponds the affirmative precept, that all our\nconceptions, deliberations, resolutions, and undertakings, ought to be\nconsistent with the benefit and advantage of our neighbours. But here we\nmeet with what appears to be a great and perplexing difficulty. For if our\nprevious assertions be true, that the terms _adultery_ and _theft_\ncomprehend the licentious desire, and the injurious and criminal\nintention, this may be thought to have superseded the necessity of a\nseparate command being afterwards introduced, forbidding us to covet the\npossessions of others. But we shall easily solve this difficulty by a\ndistinction between intention and concupiscence. For an intention, as we\nhave before observed in explaining the former commandments, is a\ndeliberate consent of the will, when the mind has been enslaved by any\nunlawful desire. Concupiscence may exist without such deliberation or\nconsent, when the mind is only attracted and stimulated by vain and\ncorrupt objects. As the Lord, therefore, has hitherto commanded our wills,\nefforts, and actions to be subject to the law of love, so now he directs\nthat the conceptions of our minds be subject to the same regulation, lest\nany of them be corrupt and perverted, and give our hearts an improper\nimpulse. As he has forbidden our minds to be inclined and persuaded to\nanger, hatred, adultery, rapine, and falsehood, so now he prohibits them\nfrom being instigated to these vices.\nL. Nor is it without cause that he requires such consummate rectitude. For\nwho can deny that it is reasonable for all the powers of our souls to be\nunder the influence of love? But if any one deviate from the path of love,\nwho can deny that that soul is in an unhealthy state? Now, whence is it,\nthat your mind conceives desires prejudicial to your neighbour, but that,\nneglecting his interest, you consult nothing but your own? For if your\nheart were full of love, there would be no part of it exposed to such\nimaginations. It must therefore be destitute of love, so far as it is the\nseat of concupiscence. Some one will object, that it is unreasonable, that\nimaginations, which without reflection flutter about in the mind, and then\nvanish away, should be condemned as symptoms of concupiscence, which has\nits seat in the heart. I reply, that the present question relates to that\nkind of imaginations, which, when they are presented to our\nunderstandings, at the same time strike our hearts, and inflame them with\ncupidity; since the mind never entertains a wish for any thing after which\nthe heart is not excited to pant. Therefore God enjoins a wonderful ardour\nof love, which he will not allow to be interrupted even by the smallest\ndegree of concupiscence. He requires a heart admirably well regulated,\nwhich he permits not to be disturbed with the least emotion contrary to\nthe law of love. Do not imagine that this doctrine is unsupported by any\ngreat authority; for I derived the first idea of it from Augustine. Now,\nthough the design of the Lord was to prohibit us from all corrupt desires,\nyet he has exhibited, as examples, those objects which most generally\ndeceive us with a fallacious appearance of pleasure; that he might not\nleave any thing to concupiscence, after having driven it from those\nobjects towards which it is most violently inclined. Behold, then, the\nsecond table of the law, which sufficiently instructs us in the duties we\nowe to men for the sake of God, on regard to whom the whole rule of love\ndepends. The duties taught in this second table, therefore, we shall\ninculcate in vain, unless our instruction be founded on the fear and\nreverence of God. To divide the prohibition of concupiscence into two\nprecepts, the discerning reader, without any comment of mine, will\npronounce to be a corrupt and violent separation of what is but one. Nor\nis the repetition of this phrase, “Thou shalt not covet,” any objection\nagainst us; because, having mentioned the house or family, God enumerates\nthe different parts of it, beginning with the wife. Hence it clearly\nappears that it ought to be read, as it is correctly read by the Hebrews,\nin one continued connection; and in short, that God commands, that all\nthat every man possesses remain safe and entire, not only from any actual\ninjury or fraudulent intention, but even from the least emotion of\ncupidity that can solicit our hearts.\nLI. But what is the tendency of the whole law, will not now be difficult\nto judge: it is to a perfection of righteousness, that it may form the\nlife of man after the example of the Divine purity. For God has so\ndelineated his own character in it, that the man who exemplifies in his\nactions the precepts it contains, will exhibit in his life, as it were, an\nimage of God. Wherefore, when Moses would recall the substance of it to\nthe remembrance of the Israelites, he said, “And now, Israel, what doth\nthe Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in\nall his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy\nheart, and with all thy soul, to keep the commandments of the Lord?”(897)\nNor did he cease to reiterate the same things to them, whenever he\nintended to point out the end of the law. The tendency of the doctrine of\nthe law is to connect man with his God, and, as Moses elsewhere expresses\nit, to make him cleave to the Lord in sanctity of life.(898) Now, the\nperfection of this sanctity consists in two principal points, already\nrecited—“that we love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all\nour soul, and with all our strength, and with all our mind; and our\nneighbour as ourselves.”(899) And the first is, that our souls be\ncompletely filled with the love of God. From this the love of our\nneighbour will naturally follow; as the Apostle signifies, when he says,\nthat “the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a\ngood conscience, and of faith unfeigned.”(900) Here we find a good\nconscience and faith unfeigned, that is, in a word, true piety, stated to\nbe the grand source from which charity is derived. He is deceived,\ntherefore, who supposes that the law teaches nothing but certain rudiments\nand first principles of righteousness, by which men are introduced to the\ncommencement, but are not directed to the true goal of good works; since\nbeyond the former sentence of Moses, and the latter of Paul, nothing\nfurther can be wanted to the highest perfection. For how far will he wish\nto proceed, who will not be content with this instruction, by which man is\ndirected to the fear of God, to the spiritual worship of him, to the\nobservance of his commands, to persevering rectitude in the way of the\nLord, to purity of conscience, and sincere faith and love? Hence we derive\na confirmation of the foregoing exposition of the law, which traces and\nfinds in its precepts all the duties of piety and love. For they who\nattend merely to dry and barren elements, as though it taught them but\nhalf of the Divine will, are declared by the Apostle to have no knowledge\nof its end.\nLII. But because Christ and his Apostles, in reciting the substance of the\nlaw, sometimes omit the first table,(901) many persons are deceived in\nthis point, who wish to extend their expressions to both tables. In the\nGospel of Matthew, Christ calls judgment, mercy, and faith, “the weightier\nmatters of the law.” By the word faith it is evident to me that he intends\ntruth or fidelity towards men. Some, however, in order to extend the\npassage to the whole law, take the word faith to mean religion towards\nGod. But for this there is no foundation; for Christ is treating of those\nworks by which man ought to prove himself to be righteous. If we attend to\nthis observation, we shall cease also to wonder, why, in another place, to\nthe inquiry of a young man, what those commandments are by the observance\nof which we enter into life, he only returns the following answer: “Thou\nshalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal,\nThou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother; and,\nThou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”(902) For obedience to the first\ntable consisted chiefly either in the disposition of the heart, or in\nceremonies. The disposition of the heart was not visible, and the\nceremonies were diligently performed by hypocrites; but the works of\ncharity are such as enable us to give a certain evidence of righteousness.\nBut the same occurs in the Prophets so frequently, that it must be\nfamiliar to the reader who is but tolerably conversant with them. For in\nalmost all cases when they exhort to repentance, they omit the first\ntable, and insist on faith, judgment, mercy, and equity. Nor do they by\nthis method neglect the fear of God, but require substantial proof of it\nfrom those marks. It is well known that when they treat of the observation\nof the law, they generally insist on the second table; because it is in it\nthat the love of righteousness and integrity is principally discovered. It\nis unnecessary to quote the passages, as every person will of himself\neasily remark what I have stated.\nLIII. Is it, then, it will be asked, of more importance towards the\nattainment of righteousness to live innocently with men, than piously\ntowards God? By no means. But because no man fulfils all the duties of\ncharity, unless he really fear God, we derive from those duties a proof of\nhis piety. Besides, the Lord, well knowing that he can receive no benefit\nfrom us, which he also declares by the Psalmist,(903) requires not our\nservices for himself, but employs us in good works towards our neighbour.\nIt is not without reason, then, that the Apostle makes all the perfection\nof the saints to consist in love;(904) which in another place he very\njustly styles “the fulfilling of the law;” adding, that “he that loveth\nanother hath fulfilled the law.”(905) Again: that “all the law is\nfulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as\nthyself.”(906) For he teaches nothing different from what is taught by\nChrist himself, when he says, “All things whatsoever ye would that men\nshould do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the\nprophets.”(907) It is certain that in the law and the prophets, faith, and\nall that pertains to the legitimate worship of God, hold the principal\nplace, and that love occupies an inferior station; but our Lord intends\nthat the observance of justice and equity among men is only prescribed to\nus in the law, that our pious fear of him, if we really possess any, may\nbe proved by our actions.\nLIV. Here, then, we must rest, that our life will then be governed\naccording to the will of God, and the prescriptions of his law, when it is\nin all respects most beneficial to our brethren. But we do not find in the\nwhole law one syllable, that lays down any rule for a man respecting those\nthings which he should practise or omit for his carnal convenience. And\nsurely, since men are born in such a state, that they are entirely\ngoverned by an immoderate self‐love,—a passion which, how great soever\ntheir departure from the truth, they always retain,—there was no need of a\nlaw which would inflame that love, already of itself too violent. Whence\nit plainly appears, that the observance of the commandments consists not\nin the love of ourselves, but in the love of God and of our neighbour;\nthat his is the best and most holy life, who lives as little as possible\nto himself; and that no man leads a worse or more iniquitous life, than he\nwho lives exclusively to himself, and makes his own interest the sole\nobject of his thoughts and pursuits. Moreover, the Lord, in order to give\nus the best expression of the strength of that love which we ought to\nexercise towards our neighbours, has regulated it by the standard of our\nself‐love, because there was no stronger or more vehement affection. And\nthe force of the expression must be carefully examined; for he does not,\naccording to the foolish dreams of some sophists, concede the first place\nto self‐love, and assign the second to the love of our neighbour; but\nrather transfers to others that affection of love which we naturally\nrestrict to ourselves. Whence the Apostle asserts that “charity seeketh\nnot her own.”(908) Nor is their argument, that every thing regulated by\nany standard is inferior to the standard by which it is regulated, worthy\nof the least attention. For God does not appoint our self‐love as the\nrule, to which our love to others should be subordinate; but whereas,\nthrough our natural depravity, our love used to terminate in ourselves, he\nshows that it ought now to be diffused abroad; that we may be ready to do\nany service to our neighbour with as much alacrity, ardour, and\nsolicitude, as to ourselves.\nLV. Now, since Christ has demonstrated, in the parable of the Samaritan,\nthat the word “neighbour” comprehends every man, even the greatest\nstranger, we have no reason to limit the commandment of love to our own\nrelations or friends. I do not deny, that the more closely any person is\nunited to us, the greater claim he has to the assistance of our kind\noffices. For the condition of humanity requires, that men should perform\nmore acts of kindness to each other, in proportion to the closeness of the\nbonds by which they are connected, whether of relationship, or\nacquaintance, or vicinity; and this without any offence to God, by whose\nprovidence we are constrained to it. But I assert, that the whole human\nrace, without any exception, should be comprehended in the same affection\nof love, and that in this respect there is no difference between the\nbarbarian and the Grecian, the worthy and unworthy, the friend and the\nfoe; for they are to be considered in God, and not in themselves, and\nwhenever we deviate from this view of the subject, it is no wonder if we\nfall into many errors. Wherefore, if we wish to adhere to the true law of\nlove, our eyes must chiefly be directed, not to man, the prospect of whom\nwould impress us with hatred more frequently than with love, but to God,\nwho commands that our love to him be diffused among all mankind; so that\nthis must always be a fundamental maxim with us, that whatever be the\ncharacter of a man, yet we ought to love him because we love God.\nLVI. Wherefore the schoolmen have discovered either their ignorance or\ntheir wickedness in a most pestilent manner, when, treating of the\nprecepts prohibiting the desire of revenge, and enjoining the love of our\nenemies, which were anciently delivered to all the Jews, and afterwards\nequally to all Christians, they have made them to be counsels which we are\nat liberty to obey or not to obey, and have confined the necessary\nobservance of them to the monks, who, on account of this very\ncircumstance, would be more righteous than plain Christians, because they\nvoluntarily bound themselves to observe these counsels. The reason which\nthey assign for not receiving them as laws, is, that they appear too\nburdensome and grievous, especially to Christians who are under the law of\ngrace. Do they presume in this manner to disannul the eternal law of God\nrespecting the love of our neighbour? Is such a distinction to be found in\nany page of the law? On the contrary, does it not abound with commandments\nmost strictly enjoining the love of our enemies? For what is the meaning\nof the injunction to feed our neighbour when he is hungry?(909) to direct\ninto the right way his oxen or his asses when they are going astray, and\nto help them when sinking under a burden?(910) Shall we do good to his\ncattle for his sake, and feel no benevolence to his person? What! is not\nthe word of the Lord eternal? “Vengeance is mine, I will repay:”(911)\nwhich is expressed in another passage still more explicitly: “Thou shalt\nnot avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people.”(912)\nLet them either obliterate these passages from the law, or acknowledge\nthat the Lord was a Legislator, and no longer falsely pretend that he was\nonly a counsellor.\nLVII. And what is the meaning of the following expressions, which they\nhave presumed to abuse by the absurdity of their comment? “Love your\nenemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and\npray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may\nbe the children of your Father which is in heaven.”(913) Here, who would\nnot argue with Chrysostom, that the allegation of such a necessary cause\nclearly proves these to be, not exhortations, but commandments? What have\nwe left us, after being expunged from the number of the children of God?\nBut according to them, the monks will be the only sons of the heavenly\nFather; they alone will venture to invoke God as their Father. What will\nnow become of the Church? Upon the same principle it will be confined to\nheathen and publicans. For Christ says, “If ye love them which love you,\nwhat reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?”(914) Shall not\nwe be in a happy situation, if they leave us the title of Christians, but\ndeprive us of the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven? The argument of\nAugustine is equally strong. When the Lord, says he, prohibits adultery,\nhe forbids you to violate the wife of your enemy no less than of your\nfriend: when he prohibits theft, he permits you not to steal from any one,\nwhether he be a friend or an enemy. Now, Paul reduces these two\nprohibitions of theft and adultery to the rule of love, and even teaches\nthat they are “briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt\nlove thy neighbour as thyself.”(915) Either, then, Paul must have been an\nerroneous expositor of the law, or it necessarily follows from this, that\nwe are commanded to love, not only our friends, but also our enemies.\nThose, therefore, who so licentiously shake off the yoke common to the\nchildren of God, evidently betray themselves to be the sons of Satan. It\nis doubtful whether they have discovered greater stupidity or impudence in\nthe publication of this dogma. For all the fathers decidedly pronounce\nthat these are mere precepts. That no doubt was entertained on the subject\nin the time of Gregory, appears from his positive assertions; for he\ntreats them as precepts, as though it had never been controverted. And how\nfoolishly do they argue! They would be a burden, say they, too grievous\nfor Christians; as though truly any thing could be conceived more\ndifficult, than to love God with all our heart, with all our soul, and\nwith all our strength. Compared with this law, every thing must be\naccounted easy, whether it be to love an enemy, or to banish from the mind\nall desire of revenge. To our imbecility, indeed, every thing is arduous\nand difficult, even the smallest point in the law. It is the Lord in whom\nwe find strength: let him give what he commands, and let him command what\nhe pleases. The being Christians under the law of grace consists not in\nunbounded license uncontrolled by any law, but in being ingrafted into\nChrist, by whose grace they are delivered from the curse of the law, and\nby whose Spirit they have the law inscribed on their hearts. This grace\nPaul has figuratively denominated a law, in allusion to the law of God, to\nwhich he was comparing and contrasting it. Their dispute concerning the\nword law is a dispute about nothing.\nLVIII. Of the same nature is what they have called venial sin—a term which\nthey apply to secret impiety, which is a breach of the first table, and to\nthe direct transgression of the last commandment. For this is their\ndefinition, that “it is evil desire without any deliberate assent, and\nwithout any long continuance in the heart.” Now, I assert that evil desire\ncannot enter the heart, except through a deficiency of those things which\nthe law requires. We are forbidden to have any strange gods. When the\nmind, assaulted by mistrust, looks around to some other quarter; when it\nis stimulated by a sudden desire of transferring its happiness from God to\nsome other being; whence proceed these emotions, however transient, but\nfrom the existence of some vacant space in the soul to receive such\ntemptations? And not to protract this argument to greater length, we are\ncommanded to love God with all our heart, with all our mind, and with all\nour soul: therefore, unless all the powers of our soul be intensely\nengaged in the love of God, we have already departed from the obedience\nrequired by the law; for that the dominion of God is not well established\nin our conscience, is evident, from the enemies that there rebel against\nhis government, and interrupt the execution of his commands. That the last\ncommandment properly belongs to this point, has been already demonstrated.\nHave we felt any evil desire in our heart? we are already guilty of\nconcupiscence, and are become at once transgressors of the law; because\nthe Lord forbids us, not only to plan and attempt any thing that would\nprove detrimental to another, but even to be stimulated and agitated with\nconcupiscence. Now, the curse of God always rests on the transgression of\nthe law. We have no reason, therefore, to exempt even the most trivial\nemotions of concupiscence from the sentence of death. “In determining the\nnature of different sins,” says Augustine, “let us not use deceitful\nbalances, to weigh what we please and how we please, according to our own\nhumour, saying, This is heavy,—This is light; but let us borrow the Divine\nbalance from the Holy Scriptures, as from the treasury of the Lord, and\ntherein weigh what is heavy; or rather let us weigh nothing ourselves, but\nacknowledge the weights already determined by the Lord.” And what says the\nScripture? The assertion of Paul, that “the wages of sin is death,”(916)\nsufficiently demonstrates this groundless distinction to have been unknown\nto him. As we have already too strong a propensity to hypocrisy, this\nopiate ought by no means to have been added, to lull our consciences into\ngreater insensibility.\nLIX. I wish these persons would consider the meaning of this declaration\nof Christ: “Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and\nshall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of\nheaven.”(917) Are not they of this number, who thus presume to extenuate\nthe transgression of the law, as though it were not worthy of death? But\nthey ought to consider, not merely what is commanded, but who it is that\ngives the commands; because the smallest transgression of the law, which\nhe has given, is a derogation from his authority. Is the violation of the\nDivine majesty in any case a trivial thing in their estimation? Lastly, if\nGod has declared his will in the law, whatever is contrary to the law\ndispleases him. Will they pretend that the wrath of God is so debilitated\nand disarmed, that the punishment of death cannot immediately follow? He\nhas unequivocally declared, if they could induce themselves to listen to\nhis voice, rather than obscure the plain truth with their frivolous\nsubtleties, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die;”(918) and, which I have\nbefore cited, “The wages of sin is death.”(919) They acknowledge it to be\nsin, because it is impossible to deny it; yet they contend that it is not\n_mortal_ sin. But, as they have hitherto too much resigned themselves to\ninfatuation, they should at length learn to return to the exercise of\ntheir reason. If they persevere in their dreams, we will take our leave of\nthem. Let the children of God know that all sin is _mortal_; because it is\na rebellion against the will of God, which necessarily provokes his wrath;\nbecause it is a transgression of the law, against which the Divine\njudgment is universally denounced; and that the offences of the saints are\n_venial_, not of their own nature, but because they obtain pardon through\nthe mercy of God."

          "title": "Chapter IX. Christ, Though Known To The Jews Under The Law, Yet Clearly",
          "content": "Revealed Only In The Gospel.\nAs it was not without reason, or without effect, that God was pleased, in\nancient times, to manifest himself as a Father by means of expiations and\nsacrifices, and that he consecrated to himself a chosen people, there is\nno doubt that he was known, even then, in the same image in which he now\nappears to us with meridian splendour. Therefore Malachi, after having\nenjoined the Jews to attend to the law of Moses, and to persevere in the\nobservance of it, (because after his death there was to be an interruption\nof the prophetical office,) immediately announces, that “the Sun of\nrighteousness shall arise.”(920) In this language he suggests, that the\nlaw tended to excite in the pious an expectation of the Messiah that was\nto come, and that at his advent there was reason to hope for a much\ngreater degree of light. For this reason Peter says that “the Prophets\nhave inquired and searched diligently concerning the salvation,” which is\nnow manifested in the gospel; and that “it was revealed to them, that not\nunto themselves, but unto us, they did minister the things which are now\nreported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you.”(921)\nNot that their instructions were useless to the ancient people, or\nunprofitable to themselves, but because they did not enjoy the treasure,\nwhich God through their hands has transmitted to us. For in the present\nday, the grace, which was the subject of their testimony, is familiarly\nexhibited before our eyes; and whereas they had but a small taste, we have\noffered to us a more copious fruition of it. Therefore Christ, who asserts\nthat “Moses wrote of him,”(922) nevertheless extols that measure of grace\nin which we excel the Jews. Addressing his disciples, he says, “Blessed\nare your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.”(923) “For I\ntell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things\nwhich ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye\nhear, and have not heard them.”(924) This is no small recommendation of\nthe evangelical revelation, that God has preferred us to those holy\nfathers who were eminent for singular piety. To this declaration that\nother passage is not at all repugnant, where Christ says, “Abraham saw my\nday, and was glad.”(925) For though his prospect of a thing so very remote\nwas attended with much obscurity, yet there was nothing wanting to the\ncertainty of a well founded hope; and hence that joy which accompanied the\nholy patriarch even to his death. Neither does this assertion of John the\nBaptist, “No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which\nis in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him,”(926) exclude the\npious, who had died before his time, from a participation of the\nunderstanding and light which shine in the person of Christ; but,\ncomparing their condition with ours, it teaches us that we have a clear\nmanifestation of those mysteries, of which they had only an obscure\nprospect through the medium of shadows; as the author of the Epistle to\nthe Hebrews more copiously and excellently shows, that “God, who at sundry\ntimes, and in divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers by the\nprophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.”(927)\nTherefore, though the only begotten Son, who is now to us “the brightness\nof the glory, and the express image of the person,”(928) of God the\nFather, was formerly known to the Jews, as we have elsewhere shown by a\nquotation from Paul, that he was the leader of their ancient deliverance\nfrom Egypt; yet this also is a truth, which is asserted by the same Paul\nin another place, that “God, who commanded the light to shine out of\ndarkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of\nthe glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”(929) For when he appeared\nin this his image, he made himself visible, as it were, in comparison with\nthe obscure and shadowy representation of him which had been given before.\nThis renders the ingratitude and obstinacy of those, who shut their eyes\namid this meridian blaze, so much the more vile and detestable. And\ntherefore Paul says that Satan, “the god of this world, hath blinded their\nminds, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine unto\nthem.”(930)\nII. Now, I understand the gospel to be a clear manifestation of the\nmystery of Christ. I grant indeed, since Paul styles the gospel _the\ndoctrine of faith_,(931) that whatever promises we find in the law\nconcerning the gracious remission of sins, by which God reconciles men to\nhimself, are accounted parts of it. For he opposes faith to those terrors\nwhich torment and harass the conscience, if salvation is to be sought by\nworks. Whence it follows, that taking the word _gospel_ in a large sense,\nit comprehends all those testimonies, which God formerly gave to the\nfathers, of his mercy and paternal favour; but it is more eminently\napplicable to the promulgation of the grace exhibited in Christ. This\nacceptation is not only sanctioned by common use, but supported by the\nauthority of Christ and the Apostles. Whence it is properly said of him,\nthat he “preached the gospel of the kingdom.”(932) And Mark introduces\nhimself with this preface: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.”\nBut it is needless to collect more passages to prove a thing sufficiently\nknown. Christ, then, by his advent, “hath brought life and immortality to\nlight through the gospel.”(933) By these expressions Paul means, not that\nthe fathers were immerged in the shades of death, till the Son of God\nbecame incarnate; but, claiming for the gospel this honourable\nprerogative, he teaches that it is a new and unusual kind of legation, in\nwhich God has performed those things that he had promised, that the truth\nof the promises might appear in the person of his Son. For though the\nfaithful have always experienced the truth of the assertion of Paul, that\n“all the promises of God in him are Yea, and in him Amen,”(934) because\nthey have been sealed in their hearts, yet, since he has completed in his\nbody all the parts of our salvation, the lively exhibition of those things\nhas justly obtained new and singular praise. Hence this declaration of\nChrist: “Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God\nascending and descending upon the Son of man.”(935) For though he seems to\nallude to the ladder which the patriarch Jacob saw in a vision, yet he\ndisplays the superior excellence of his advent by this character—that he\nhas opened the gate of heaven to give us free admittance into it.\nIII. Nevertheless, we must beware of the diabolical imagination of\nServetus, who, while he designs to extol the magnitude of the grace of\nChrist, or at least professes such a design, totally abolishes all the\npromises, as though they were terminated together with the law. He\npretends, that by faith in the gospel we receive the completion of all the\npromises; as though there were no distinction between us and Christ. I\nhave just observed, that Christ left nothing incomplete of all that was\nessential to our salvation; but it is not a fair inference, that we\nalready enjoy the benefits procured by him; for this would contradict the\ndeclaration of Paul, that “hope is laid up for us.”(936) I grant, indeed,\nthat when we believe in Christ, we at the same time pass from death to\nlife; but we should also remember the observation of John, that though “we\nare now the sons of God, it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we\nknow that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see\nhim as he is.”(937) Though Christ, therefore, offers us in the gospel a\npresent plenitude of spiritual blessings, yet the fruition of them is\nconcealed under the custody of hope, till we are divested of our\ncorruptible body, and transfigured into the glory of him who has gone\nbefore us. In the mean time, the Holy Spirit commands us to rely on the\npromises; and his authority we ought to consider sufficient to silence all\nthe clamours of Servetus. For according to the testimony of Paul,\n“godliness hath promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to\ncome;”(938) and therefore he boasts of being an Apostle of Christ;\n“according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.”(939) In\nanother place he apprizes us that we have the same promises which were\ngiven to the saints in former times.(940) Finally, he represents it as the\nsummit of felicity, that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of\npromise.(941) Nor, indeed, have we otherwise any enjoyment of Christ, any\nfurther than as we embrace him invested with his promises. Hence it is,\nthat he dwells in our hearts, and yet we live like pilgrims at a distance\nfrom him; because “we walk by faith, and not by sight.” Nor is there any\ncontrariety in these two positions, that we possess in Christ all that\nbelongs to the perfection of the life of heaven, and yet that faith is a\nvision of invisible blessings. Only there is a difference to be observed\nin the nature or quality of the promises; because the gospel affords a\nclear discovery of that which the law has represented in shadows and\ntypes.\nIV. This likewise evinces the error of those who never make any other\ncomparison between the Law and the Gospel, than between the merit of works\nand the gratuitous imputation of righteousness. This antithesis, I grant,\nis by no means to be rejected; because Paul by the word _law_ frequently\nintends the rule of a righteous life, in which God requires of us what we\nowe to him, affording us no hope of life, unless we fulfil every part of\nit, and, on the contrary, annexing a curse if we are guilty of the\nsmallest transgression. This is the sense in which he uses it in those\npassages, where he argues that we are accepted by God through grace, and\nare accounted righteous through his pardon of our sins, because the\nobservance of the law, to which the reward is promised, is not to be found\nin any man. Paul, therefore, justly represents the righteousness of the\nlaw and that of the gospel as opposed to each other. But the gospel has\nnot succeeded the whole law, so as to introduce a different way of\nsalvation; but rather to confirm and ratify the promises of the law, and\nto connect the body with the shadows. For when Christ says that “the law\nand the prophets were until John,” he does not abandon the fathers to the\ncurse which the slaves of the law cannot escape; he rather implies that\nthey were only initiated in the rudiments of religion, so that they\nremained far below the sublimity of the evangelical doctrine. Wherefore,\nwhen Paul calls the gospel “the power of God unto salvation to every one\nthat believeth,” he afterwards adds that it is “witnessed by the law and\nthe prophets.”(942) But at the end of the same Epistle, although he\nasserts that the preaching of Jesus Christ is “the revelation of the\nmystery which was kept secret since the world began,” he qualifies this\nsentiment with the following explication—that it “is now made manifest,\nand by the Scriptures of the prophets made known to all nations.”(943)\nHence we conclude, that when mention is made of the whole law, the gospel\ndiffers from it only with respect to a clear manifestation; but on account\nof the inestimable plenitude of grace, which has been displayed to us in\nChrist, the celestial kingdom of God is justly said to have been erected\nin the earth at his advent.\nV. Now, John was placed between the Law and the Gospel, holding an\nintermediate office connected with both. For though, in calling Christ\n“the Lamb of God” and “the victim for the expiation of sins,”(944) he\npreached the substance of the gospel; yet, because he did not clearly\nexpress that incomparable power and glory which afterwards appeared in his\nresurrection, Christ affirms that he is not equal to the Apostles. This is\nhis meaning in the following words: “Among them that are born of women,\nthere hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he\nthat is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”(945) For he is\nnot there commending the persons of men, but after having preferred John\nto all the prophets, he allots the highest degree of honour to the\npreaching of the gospel, which we have elsewhere seen is signified by “the\nkingdom of heaven.” When John himself said that he was only a\n“voice,”(946) as though he were inferior to the prophets, this declaration\nproceeded not from a pretended humility; he meant to signify that he was\nnot intrusted with a proper embassy, but acted merely in the capacity of a\nherald, according to the prediction of Malachi: “Behold, I will send you\nElijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the\nLord.”(947) Nor indeed, through the whole course of his ministry, did he\naim at any thing but procuring disciples for Christ, which he also proves\nfrom Isaiah to have been the commission given him by God. In this sense he\nwas called by Christ “a burning and a shining light,”(948) because the\nfull day had not yet arrived. Yet this is no reason why he should not be\nnumbered among the preachers of the gospel, as he used the same baptism\nwhich was afterwards delivered to the apostles. But it was not till after\nChrist was received into the celestial glory, that the more free and rapid\nprogress of the apostles completed what John had begun."

          "title": "Chapter X. The Similarity Of The Old And New Testaments.",
          "content": "From the preceding observations it may now be evident, that all those\npersons, from the beginning of the world, whom God has adopted into the\nsociety of his people, have been federally connected with him by the same\nlaw and the same doctrine which are in force among us: but because it is\nof no small importance that this point be established, I shall show, by\nway of appendix, since the fathers were partakers with us of the same\ninheritance, and hoped for the same salvation through the grace of our\ncommon Mediator, how far their condition in this connection was different\nfrom ours. For though the testimonies we have collected from the law and\nthe prophets in proof of this, render it sufficiently evident that the\npeople of God have never had any other rule of religion and piety, yet\nbecause some writers have raised many disputes concerning the difference\nof the Old and New Testaments, which may occasion doubts in the mind of an\nundiscerning reader, we shall assign a particular chapter for the better\nand more accurate discussion of this subject. Moreover, what would\notherwise have been very useful, has now been rendered necessary for us by\nServetus and some madmen of the sect of the Anabaptists, who entertain no\nother ideas of the Israelitish nation, than of a herd of swine, whom they\npretend to have been pampered by the Lord in this world, without the least\nhope of a future immortality in heaven. To defend the pious mind,\ntherefore, from this pestilent error, and at the same time to remove all\ndifficulties which may arise from the mention of a diversity between the\nOld and New Testaments, let us, as we proceed, examine what similarity\nthere is between them, and what difference; what covenant the Lord made\nwith the Israelites, in ancient times, before the advent of Christ, and\nwhat he has entered into with us since his manifestation in the flesh.\nII. And, indeed, both these topics may be despatched in one word. The\ncovenant of all the fathers is so far from differing substantially from\nours, that it is the very same; it only varies in the administration. But\nas such extreme brevity would not convey to any man a clear understanding\nof the subject, it is necessary, if we would do any good, to proceed to a\nmore diffuse explication of it. But in showing their similarity, or rather\nunity, it will be needless to recapitulate all the particulars which have\nalready been mentioned, and unseasonable to introduce those things which\nremain to be discussed in some other place. We must here insist chiefly on\nthree principal points. We have to maintain, First, that carnal opulence\nand felicity were not proposed to the Jews as the mark towards which they\nshould ultimately aspire, but that they were adopted to the hope of\nimmortality, and that the truth of this adoption was certified to them by\noracles, by the law, and by the prophets. Secondly, that the covenant, by\nwhich they were united to the Lord, was founded, not on any merits of\ntheirs, but on the mere mercy of God who called them. Thirdly, that they\nboth possessed and knew Christ as the Mediator, by whom they were united\nto God, and became partakers of his promises. The second of these points,\nas perhaps it is not yet sufficiently known, shall be demonstrated at\nlarge in its proper place. For we shall prove by numerous and explicit\ntestimonies of the prophets, that whatever blessing the Lord ever gave or\npromised to his people, proceeded from his indulgent goodness. The third\npoint has been clearly demonstrated in several places. And we have not\nwholly neglected the first.\nIII. In discussing the first point, therefore, because it principally\nbelongs to the present argument, and is the grand subject of their\ncontroversy against us, we will use the more diligent application; yet in\nsuch a manner, that if any thing be wanting to the explication of the\nothers, it may be supplied as we proceed, or added afterwards in a\nsuitable place. Indeed, the apostle removes every doubt respecting all\nthese points, when he says, that God the Father “promised afore by his\nprophets in the holy Scriptures, the gospel concerning his Son,”(949)\nwhich he promulgated in the appointed time: and again, that the\nrighteousness of faith, which is revealed in the gospel, is “witnessed by\nthe law and the prophets.”(950) For the gospel does not detain men in the\njoy of the present life, but elevates them to the hope of immortality;\ndoes not fasten them to terrestrial delights, but announcing to them a\nhope reserved in heaven, does as it were transport them thither. For this\nis the description which he gives in another place: “In whom also after\nthat ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which\nis the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased\npossession.”(951) Again: “We heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of\nthe love which ye have to all the saints, for the hope which is laid up\nfor you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the\ngospel.”(952) Again: “He called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the\nglory of our Lord Jesus Christ.”(953) Whence it is called “the word of\nsalvation,” and “the power of God to the salvation of believers,” and “the\nkingdom of heaven.” Now, if the doctrine of the gospel be spiritual, and\nopen a way to the possession of an immortal life, let us not suppose that\nthey, to whom it was promised and announced, were totally negligent and\ncareless of their souls, and stupefied in the pursuit of corporeal\npleasures. Nor let any one here cavil, that the promises which are\nrecorded in the law and the prophets, respecting the gospel, were not\ndesigned for the Jews. For just after having spoken of the gospel being\npromised in the law, he adds, “that what things soever the law saith, it\nsaith to them who are under the law.”(954) This was in another argument, I\ngrant; but when he said that whatever the law inculcates truly belonged to\nthe Jews, he was not so forgetful as not to remember what he had affirmed,\na few verses before, concerning the gospel promised in the law. By\ndeclaring that the Old Testament contained evangelical promises,\ntherefore, the apostle most clearly demonstrates that it principally\nrelated to a future life.\nIV. For the same reason it follows, that it was founded on the free mercy\nof God, and confirmed by the mediation of Christ. For even the preaching\nof the gospel only announces, that sinners are justified by the paternal\ngoodness of God, independently of any merit of their own; and the whole\nsubstance of it terminates in Christ. Who, then, dares to represent the\nJews as destitute of Christ,—them with whom we are informed the\nevangelical covenant was made, of which Christ is the sole foundation? Who\ndares to represent them as strangers to the benefit of a free salvation,\nto whom we are informed the doctrine of the righteousness of faith was\ncommunicated? But not to be prolix in disputing on a clear point, we have\na remarkable expression of the Lord: “Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and\nhe saw it, and was glad.”(955) And what Christ there declares concerning\nAbraham, the apostle shows to have been universal among the faithful, when\nhe says that Christ remains “the same yesterday, and to‐day, and for\never.”(956) For he there speaks, not only of the eternal Divinity of\nChrist, but of his power, which has been perpetually manifested to the\nfaithful. Wherefore both the blessed Virgin and Zachariah declare, in\ntheir songs, that the salvation revealed in Christ is a performance of the\npromises which the Lord had made to Abraham and the patriarchs.(957) If\nthe Lord, in the manifestation of Christ, faithfully performed his ancient\noath, it cannot be denied that the end of the Old Testament was always in\nChrist and eternal life.\nV. Moreover the apostle makes the Israelites equal to us, not only in the\ngrace of the covenant, but also in the signification of the sacraments.\nFor when he means to adduce examples of the punishments with which the\nScripture states them to have been formerly chastised, in order to deter\nthe Corinthians from running into similar crimes, he begins by premising,\nthat we have no reason to arrogate any preëminence to ourselves, which can\ndeliver us from the Divine vengeance inflicted on them; since the Lord not\nonly favoured them with the same benefits, but illustrated his grace among\nthem by the same symbols;(958) as though he had said, If ye confide in\nbeing beyond the reach of danger, because both baptism by which you have\nbeen sealed, and the supper which you daily receive, have excellent\npromises, while at the same time you despise the Divine goodness, and live\nlicentious lives,—know ye, that the Jews also were not destitute of such\nsymbols, though the Lord inflicted on them his severest judgments. They\nwere baptized in their passage through the sea, and in the cloud by which\nthey were protected from the fervour of the sun. Our opponents maintain\nthat passage to have been a carnal baptism, corresponding in some degree\nto our spiritual one. But if that were admitted, the apostle’s argument\nwould not proceed; for his design here is to prevent Christians from\nsupposing that they excel the Jews in the privilege of baptism. Nor is\nwhat immediately follows, that they “did all eat the same spiritual meat,\nand did all drink the same spiritual drink,” which he interprets of\nChrist, liable to this cavil.\nVI. To invalidate this declaration of Paul, they object the assertion of\nChrist, “Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. If\nany man eat of this bread, (that is, my flesh,) he shall live for\never.”(959) But the two passages are reconciled without any difficulty.\nThe Lord, because he was addressing auditors who only sought to be\nsatisfied with corporeal sustenance, but were unconcerned about food for\nthe soul, accommodates his discourse in some measure to their capacity,\nand institutes a comparison between manna and his own body, particularly\nto strike their senses. They demand that in order to acquire authority to\nhimself, he should prove his power by some miracle, such as Moses\nperformed in the desert, when he obtained manna from heaven. In the manna,\nhowever, they had no idea of any thing but a remedy for corporeal hunger,\nwith which the people were then afflicted. They did not penetrate to that\nsublimer mystery of which Paul treats. Christ, therefore, to demonstrate\nthe superiority of the blessing they ought to expect from him, to that\nwhich they said their fathers had received from Moses, makes this\ncomparison: If it be in your opinion a great and memorable miracle, that\nthe Lord, to prevent his people from perishing in the wilderness, supplied\nthem, by means of Moses, with heavenly food, which served them as a\ntemporary sustenance,—hence conclude how much more excellent that food\nmust be, which communicates immortality. We see, then, why the Lord\nomitted the principal thing designed by the manna, and only remarked the\nlowest advantage that resulted from it. It was because the Jews, as if\nwith an intention of reproaching him, contrasted him with Moses, who had\nsupplied the necessities of the people with manna. He replies, that he is\nthe dispenser of a far superior favour, in comparison with which the\ncorporeal sustenance of the people, the sole object of their great\nadmiration, deserves to be considered as nothing. Knowing that the Lord,\nwhen he rained manna from heaven, not only poured it down for the support\nof their bodies, but likewise dispersed it as a spiritual mystery, to\ntypify that spiritual vivification which is experienced in Christ, Paul\ndoes not neglect that view of the subject which is most deserving of\nconsideration. Wherefore it is certainly and clearly proved, that the same\npromises of an eternal and heavenly life, with which the Lord now favours\nus, were not only communicated to the Jews, but even sealed and confirmed\nby sacraments truly spiritual. This subject is argued at length by\nAugustine against Faustus the Manichæan.\nVII. But if the reader would prefer a recital of testimonies from the law\nand the prophets, to show him that the spiritual covenant was common also\nto the fathers, as we have heard from Christ and his apostles,—I will\nattend to this wish, and that with the greater readiness, because our\nadversaries will thereby be more decisively confuted, and will have no\npretence for any future cavil. I will begin with that demonstration,\nwhich, though I know the Anabaptists will superciliously deem it futile\nand almost ridiculous, yet will have considerable weight with persons of\ndocility and good understanding. And I take it for granted, that there is\nsuch a vital efficacy in the Divine word as to quicken the souls of all\nthose whom God favours with a participation of it. For the assertion of\nPeter has ever been true, that it is “an incorruptible seed, which abideth\nfor ever;”(960) as he also concludes from the words of Isaiah.(961) Now,\nwhen God anciently united the Jews with himself in this sacred bond, there\nis no doubt that he separated them to the hope of eternal life. For when I\nsay, that they embraced the word which was to connect them more closely\nwith God, I advert not to that general species of communication with him,\nwhich is diffused through heaven and earth, and all the creatures in the\nuniverse, which although it animates all things according to their\nrespective natures, yet does not deliver from the necessity of corruption.\nI refer to that particular species of communication, by which the minds of\nthe pious are enlightened into the knowledge of God, and in some measure\nunited to him. Since Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, and the other patriarchs,\nwere attached to God by such an illumination of his word, I maintain,\nthere can be no doubt that they had an entrance into his immortal kingdom.\nFor it was a real participation of God, which cannot be separated from the\nblessing of eternal life.\nVIII. If the subject still appear involved in any obscurity, let us\nproceed to the very form of the covenant; which will not only satisfy\nsober minds, but will abundantly prove the ignorance of those who\nendeavour to oppose it. For the Lord has always made this covenant with\nhis servants: “I will be your God, and ye shall be my people.”(962) These\nexpressions, according to the common explanation of the prophets,\ncomprehend life, and salvation, and consummate felicity. For it is not\nwithout reason that David frequently pronounces, how “blessed is the\nnation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his\nown inheritance;”(963) and that not on account of any earthly felicity,\nbut because he delivers from death, perpetually preserves, and attends\nwith everlasting mercy, those whom he has taken for his people. As it is\nexpressed in the other prophets, “Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my\nGod, mine Holy One? we shall not die.”(964) “The Lord is our Lawgiver, the\nLord is our King; he will save us.”(965) “Happy art thou, O Israel: who is\nlike unto thee, O people saved by the Lord?”(966) But not to labour much\non a point which does not require it, we are frequently reminded, in\nreading the prophets, that we shall have a plenitude of all blessings, and\neven a certainty of salvation, provided the Lord be our God. And that on\ngood ground; for if his face, as soon as it has begun to shine, be a\npresent pledge of salvation, will God manifest himself to any man without\nopening the treasures of salvation to him? For God is our God, on the\nexpress condition of his “walking in the midst of us,” as he declared by\nMoses.(967) But this presence of his cannot be obtained without the\npossession of life. And though nothing further had been expressed, they\nhad a promise of spiritual life sufficiently clear in these words: “I am\nthe Lord your God.”(968) For he announced that he would be a God, not only\nto their bodies, but chiefly to their souls; for the soul, unless united\nto God by righteousness, remains alienated from him at death. But let that\nunion take place, and it will be attended with eternal salvation.\nIX. Moreover, he not only declared himself to be their God, but promised\nto continue so for ever; in order that their hope, not contented with\npresent blessings, might be extended to eternity. And that the use of the\nfuture tense conveyed this idea to them, appears from many expressions,\nwhere the faithful console themselves not only amidst present evils, but\nfor futurity, that God will never desert them. But in regard to the second\npart of the promise, he still more plainly encouraged them concerning the\nextension of the Divine blessing to them beyond the limits of the present\nlife: “I will be a God to thy seed after thee.”(969) For if he intended to\ndeclare his benevolence to them after they were dead, by blessing their\nposterity, much more would he not fail of manifesting his favour towards\nthemselves. For God is not like men, who transfer their love to the\nchildren of their friends, because death takes away their opportunity of\nperforming kind offices to those who were objects of their regard. But\nGod, whose beneficence is not interrupted by death, deprives not the dead\nof the blessings of his mercy, which for their sakes he diffuses through a\nthousand generations. The design of the Lord, therefore, was to show them,\nby a clear proof, the magnitude and abundance of his goodness which they\nshould experience after death, when he described its exuberance as\nreaching to all their posterity.(970) Now, the Lord sealed the truth, and,\nas it were, exhibited the completion of this promise, when he called\nhimself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, long after they were\ndead.(971) For what is implied in it? Would it not have been a ridiculous\nappellation, if they had perished? It would have been just as if he had\nsaid, I am the God of those who have no existence. Wherefore, the\nevangelists relate, that with this single argument the Sadducees were so\nembarrassed by Christ,(972) as to be unable to deny that Moses had given a\ntestimony in favour of the resurrection of the dead; for they had learned\nfrom Moses himself, that “all his saints are in his hand.”(973) Whence it\nwas easy to infer, that death had not annihilated those whom he, who is\nthe arbiter of life and death, had received into his guardianship and\nprotection.\nX. Now, to come to the principal point on which this controversy turns,\nlet us examine, whether the faithful themselves were not so instructed by\nthe Lord, as to be sensible that they had a better life in another world,\nand to meditate on that to the neglect of the present. In the first place,\nthe course of life which was divinely enjoined them was a perpetual\nexercise, by which they were reminded that they were the most miserable of\nall mankind, if they had no happiness but in the present life. Adam,\nrendered most unhappy by the mere remembrance of his lost felicity, finds\ngreat difficulty in supplying his wants by anxious toils.(974) Nor does\nthe Divine malediction confine itself to his manual labours; he\nexperiences the bitterest sorrow from that which was his only remaining\nconsolation. Of his two sons, he is deprived of one by the parricidal\nhands of his brother; the survivor is deservedly the object of his\ndetestation and abhorrence.(975) Abel, cruelly assassinated in the flower\nof his age, exhibits an example of human calamity. Noah, while the whole\nworld securely abandons itself to sensual delights, consumes a valuable\npart of his life with excessive fatigue in building the ark.(976) His\nescape from death was attended with greater distress than if he had died a\nhundred times. For besides that the ark was, as it were, a sepulchre to\nhim for ten months,(977) nothing could be more disagreeable than to be\ndetained for so long a period almost immersed in the ordure of animals.\nAfter having escaped from such great difficulties, he meets with a fresh\noccasion of grief. He sees himself ridiculed by his own son, and is\nconstrained to pronounce a curse with his own mouth upon him, whom by the\ngreat goodness of God he had received safe from the deluge.(978)\nXI. Abraham is one who ought to be deemed equal to a host, if we consider\nhis faith, which is proposed to us as the best standard of believing, so\nthat we must be numbered in his family, in order to be the children of\nGod. Now, what would be more absurd, than that Abraham should be the\nfather of all the faithful, and not possess even the lowest place among\nthem? But he cannot be excluded from the number, nor even from the most\nhonourable station, without the destruction of the whole Church. Now, with\nrespect to the circumstances of his life;—when he is first called, he is\ntorn by the Divine command from his country, his parents, and his friends,\nthe enjoyment of whom is supposed to give life its principal relish; as\nthough God positively intended to deprive him of all the pleasures of\nlife.(979) As soon as he has entered the land in which he is commanded to\nreside, he is driven from it by a famine. He removes, in search of relief,\nto a place where, for the preservation of his own safety, he finds it\nnecessary to disown his wife, which would probably be more afflictive to\nhim than many deaths.(980) After having returned to the country of his\nresidence, he is again expelled from it by famine. What kind of felicity\nis it to dwell in such a country, where he must so frequently experience\nhunger, and even perish for want of sustenance, unless he leaves it? In\nthe country of Abimelech, he is again driven to the same necessity of\npurchasing his own personal safety with the loss of his wife.(981) While\nhe wanders hither and thither for many years in an unsettled state, he is\ncompelled, by the continual quarrels of his servants, to send away his\nnephew, whom he regarded as a son.(982) There is no doubt that he bore\nthis separation just as he would the amputation of one of his limbs. Soon\nafter he is informed that enemies have carried him away captive.(983)\nWhithersoever he directs his course, he finds himself surrounded by savage\nbarbarians, who will not even permit him to drink the water of wells which\nwith immense labour he has himself digged. For he could not have bought\nthe use of them from the king of Gerar, if it had not been previously\nprohibited.(984) When he arrives to old age, beyond the time of having\nchildren, he experiences the most disagreeable and painful circumstance\nwith which that age is attended.(985) He sees himself destitute of\nposterity, till, beyond all expectation, he begets Ishmael; whose birth he\npurchases at a dear rate, while he is wearied with the reproaches of\nSarah, just as if he encouraged the contumacy of his maid‐servant, and so\nwere himself the cause of the domestic disturbance.(986) At length Isaac\nis born; but his birth is attended with this condition, that Ishmael the\nfirst‐born must be banished from the family, and abandoned like an\nenemy.(987) When Isaac is left alone to solace the good man in his\ndeclining years, he is soon after commanded to sacrifice him.(988) What\ncan the human mind imagine more calamitous, than for a father to become\nthe executioner of his own son? If he had been taken away by sickness,\nevery one would have thought the aged parent unhappy in the extreme, as\nhaving had a son given him in mockery, at the loss of whom, his former\ngrief on account of his being destitute of children would certainly be\nredoubled. If he had been massacred by some stranger, the calamity would\nhave been greatly increased by the horrible nature of his end; but to be\nslain by his father’s own hand exceeds all the other instances of\ndistress. In short, through the whole course of his life, Abraham was so\ndriven about and afflicted, that if any one wished to give an example of a\nlife full of calamity, he could not find one more suitable. Nor let it be\nobjected, that he was not entirely miserable, because he had at length a\nprosperous deliverance from such numerous and extreme dangers. For we\ncannot pronounce his to be a happy life, who for a long period struggles\nthrough an infinity of difficulties; but his, who is exempted from\nafflictions, and favoured with the peaceful enjoyment of present\nblessings.\nXII. Isaac, though afflicted with fewer calamities, yet scarcely ever\nenjoys the smallest taste of pleasure. He also experiences those vexations\nwhich permit not a man to be happy in the world. Famine drives him from\nthe land of Canaan; his wife is torn from his bosom; his neighbours\nfrequently harass him, and take every method of distressing him, so that\nhe also is constrained to contend with them about water.(989) In his own\nfamily he suffers much uneasiness from Esau’s wives;(990) he is distressed\nby the discord of his sons, and unable to remedy that great evil, but by\nthe exile of him to whom he had given the blessing.(991) With respect to\nJacob, he is an eminent example of nothing but extreme infelicity. He\npasses his childhood at home, amidst the menaces and terrors of his elder\nbrother, to which he is at length constrained to give way.(992) A fugitive\nfrom his parents and his native soil, in addition to the bitterness of\nexile, he is treated with unkindness by his uncle Laban. It is not\nsufficient for him to endure a most hard and severe servitude of seven\nyears, but he is fraudulently deceived in a wife.(993) For the sake of\nanother wife he must enter on a new servitude,(994) in which, as he\nhimself complains, he is scorched all the day by the fervid rays of the\nsun, and through the wakeful night benumbed by the icy cold.(995) During\ntwenty years, which he spends in such extreme hardships, he is daily\nafflicted with fresh injuries from his father‐in‐law. Nor does he enjoy\ntranquillity in his own family, which he sees distracted and almost torn\nasunder by the animosities, contentions, and rivalship of his wives.(996)\nWhen he is commanded to return to his own country, he is obliged to depart\nin a manner resembling an ignominious flight. Nor even then can he escape\nthe iniquity of his father‐in‐law, but is harassed with his reproaches and\ninsults in the midst of his journey.(997) Immediately after, he falls into\na much greater difficulty. For as he advances towards his brother, he has\ndeath before his eyes in as many forms as a cruel and inveterate enemy can\npossibly contrive. He is exceedingly tormented and distracted with\ndreadful terrors, while he is expecting the approach of his brother; when\nhe sees him, he falls at his feet like a person half dead, till he finds\nhim more reconciled than he could have ventured to hope.(998) Moreover, on\nhis first entrance into the land, he is deprived of Rachel, his dearly\nbeloved wife.(999) Afterwards he hears that the son whom he had by her,\nand whom, therefore, he loved above the rest, is torn asunder by wild\nbeasts. The severity of his grief on account of his death is expressed by\nhimself, when, after many days of mourning, he obstinately refuses all\nconsolation, saying, “I will go down into the grave unto my son\nmourning.”(1000) In the mean time, the rape and violation of his daughter,\nand the rashness of his sons in revenging it, which not only made him an\nobject of abhorrence to all the inhabitants of the country, but put him in\nimmediate danger of being massacred; what abundant sources were these of\nanxiety, grief, and vexation!(1001) Then follows the horrible crime of\nReuben, his first‐born, than which no greater affliction could befall him.\nFor if the pollution of a man’s wife be numbered among the greatest\nmiseries, what shall we say of it, when the crime is perpetrated by his\nown son?(1002) Not long after, his family is contaminated with\nincest;(1003) so that such a number of disgraceful occurrences may be\nexpected to break a heart otherwise very firm and unbroken by calamities.\nTowards the end of life, when he is seeking sustenance for himself and\nfamily in a season of famine, his ears are wounded by the report of a new\ncalamity, which informs him that one of his sons is detained in prison;\nand in order to recover him he is obliged to intrust his darling Benjamin\nto the care of the rest.(1004) Who can suppose that in such an\naccumulation of distresses he had a single moment of respite? He himself,\nwho is best able to give a testimony respecting himself, declares to\nPharaoh, that his days on the earth have been few and evil.(1005) By\naffirming that he has lived in continual miseries, he denies that he has\nenjoyed that prosperity which the Lord had promised him. Therefore either\nJacob formed an improper and ungrateful estimate of the favour of God, or\nhe spake the truth in asserting that he had been miserable on the earth.\nIf his affirmation was true, it follows that his hope was not fixed on\nterrestrial things.\nXIII. If these holy fathers expected, as undoubtedly they did expect, a\nlife of happiness from the hand of God, they both knew and contemplated a\ndifferent kind of blessedness from that of this terrestrial life. This the\napostle very beautifully shows, when he says, “By faith Abraham sojourned\nin the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles\nwith Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; for he\nlooked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.\nThese all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen\nthem afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them and confessed\nthat they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such\nthings declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly if they had\nbeen mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have\nhad opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country,\nthat is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God;\nfor he hath prepared for them a city.”(1006) For they would have been\nstupid beyond all comparison, so steadily to follow promises, of which\nthere appeared no hope on earth, unless they had expected the completion\nof them in another world. But the apostle, with great force, principally\ninsists on this—that they called the present life a _pilgrimage_, as is\nalso stated by Moses.(1007) For if they were strangers and sojourners in\nthe land of Canaan, what became of the Divine promise, by which they had\nbeen appointed heirs of it? This manifestly implies, therefore, that the\npromise, which the Lord had given them concerning the possession of it,\nrelated to something more remote. Wherefore they never acquired a foot of\nland in Canaan, except for a sepulchre; by which they testified that they\nhad no hope of enjoying the benefit of the promise till after death. And\nthis is the reason why Jacob thought it so exceedingly desirable to be\nburied there, that he made his son Joseph promise it to him by oath;(1008)\nand why Joseph commanded that his bones should be removed thither, even\nseveral ages after his death, when they would have been long reduced to\nashes.(1009)\nXIV. In short, it evidently appears, that in all the pursuits of life they\nkept in view the blessedness of the future state. For why should Jacob\nhave so eagerly desired, and exposed himself to such danger in\nendeavouring to obtain, the primogeniture, which would occasion his exile,\nand almost his rejection from his family, but from which he could derive\nno possible benefit, unless he had his views fixed on a nobler blessing?\nAnd that such was his view he declared in these words, which he uttered\nwith his expiring breath: “I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.”(1010)\nWhat salvation could he expect, when he felt himself about to expire,\nunless he had seen in death the commencement of a new life? But why do we\nargue concerning the saints and children of God, when even one, who in\nother respects endeavoured to oppose the truth, was not entirely destitute\nof such a knowledge? For what was the meaning of Balaam, when he said,\n“Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like\nhis,”(1011) but the same which David afterwards expressed in the following\nwords? “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his\nsaints.”(1012) “Evil shall slay the wicked.”(1013) If death were the\nultimate bound of human existence, no difference could be observed in it\nbetween the righteous and the impious; the distinction between them\nconsists in the different destinies which await them after death.\nXV. We have not yet proceeded beyond Moses; whose only office, our\nopponents allege, was to persuade a carnal people to the worship of God by\nthe fertility of the land, and an abundance of all things: and yet, unless\nany one wilfully rejects the evidence presented to him, we already\ndiscover a clear declaration of a spiritual covenant. But if we come down\nto the prophets, there we have the fullest revelation both of eternal life\nand of the kingdom of Christ. And first, with what perspicuity and\ncertainty does David direct all his writings to this end; though, as he\nwas prior to the rest in point of time, so, according to the order of the\nDivine dispensation, he shadowed forth the heavenly mysteries more\nobscurely than they did! What estimate he formed of his terrestrial\nhabitation, the following passage declares: “I am a stranger with thee,\nand a sojourner, as all my fathers were. Verily, every man at his best\nestate is altogether vanity. Surely every man walketh in a vain show. And\nnow, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.”(1014) He who, after\nhaving confessed that there is nothing substantial or permanent on earth,\nstill retains the constancy of his hope in God, certainly contemplates the\nfelicity reserved for him in another world. To this contemplation he\nfrequently recalls the faithful, whenever he wishes to afford them true\nconsolation. For in another place, after having spoken of the brevity and\nthe transitory nature of human life, he adds, “But the mercy of the Lord\nis from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him.”(1015) Similar\nto which is the following: “Of old hast thou laid the foundations of the\nearth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but\nthou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a\nvesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed; but thou art\nthe same, and thy years shall have no end. The children of thy servants\nshall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.”(1016)\nIf, notwithstanding the destruction of heaven and earth, the pious cease\nnot to be established before the Lord, it follows that their salvation is\nconnected with his eternity. But this hope cannot be at all supported,\nunless it rest on the promise which we find in Isaiah: “The heavens,”\nsaith the Lord, “shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old\nlike a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner; but\nmy salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be\nabolished;”(1017) where perpetuity is ascribed to righteousness and\nsalvation, considered not as resident in God, but as experienced by men.\nXVI. Nor can what he frequently says concerning the prosperity of the\nfaithful be understood in any other sense than as referring to the\nmanifestation of the glory of heaven. Such are the following passages:\n“The Lord preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of\nthe hand of the wicked. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for\nthe upright in heart.”(1018) Again: “The righteousness of the righteous\nendureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. The desire of\nthe wicked shall perish.”(1019) Again: “Surely the righteous shall give\nthanks unto thy name; the upright shall dwell in thy presence.”(1020)\nAgain: “The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.”(1021)\nAgain: “The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants.”(1022) For the Lord\nfrequently leaves his servants to the rage of the impious, not only to be\nharassed, but to be torn asunder and ruined; he suffers good men to\nlanguish in obscurity and meanness, while the impious are almost as\nglorious as the stars; nor does he exhilarate the faithful with the light\nof his countenance, so that they can enjoy any lasting pleasure. Wherefore\nDavid does not dissemble that, if the faithful fix their eyes on the\npresent state of things, they will be most grievously tempted with an\napprehension lest innocence should obtain from God neither favour nor\nreward. So much does impiety in most cases prosper and flourish, while the\npious are oppressed with ignominy, poverty, contempt, and distress of\nevery kind. “My feet,” says he, “were almost gone; my steps had well nigh\nslipped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of\nthe wicked.”(1023) At length he concludes his account of them: “When I\nthought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the\nsanctuary of God; then understood I their end.”(1024)\nXVII. We may learn, then, even from this confession of David, that the\nholy fathers under the Old Testament were not ignorant, that God rarely or\nnever in this world gives his servants those things which he promises\nthem, and that, therefore, they elevated their minds to the sanctuary of\nGod, where they had a treasure in reserve which is not visible amid the\nshadows of the present life. This sanctuary was the last judgment, which,\nnot being discernible by their eyes, they were contented to apprehend by\nfaith. Relying on this confidence, whatever events might befall them in\nthe world, they, nevertheless, had no doubt that there would come a time\nwhen the Divine promises would be fulfilled. This is evident from the\nfollowing passages: “I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be\nsatisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.”(1025) Again: “I am like a\ngreen olive‐tree in the house of God.”(1026) Again: “The righteous shall\nflourish like the palm‐tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those\nthat be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of\nour God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat\nand flourishing.” He had just before said, “O Lord, how great are thy\nworks! and thy thoughts are very deep. When the wicked spring as the\ngrass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that they\nshall be destroyed for ever.”(1027) Where can this beauty and gracefulness\nof the faithful be found, but where the appearance of this world has been\nreversed by the manifestation of the kingdom of God? When they could turn\ntheir eyes towards that eternity, despising the momentary rigour of\npresent calamities, they securely broke forth into the following\nexpressions: “The Lord shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. But\nthou, O God, shalt bring them” (wicked men) “down into the pit of\ndestruction.”(1028) Where, in this world, is the pit of destruction, to\nabsorb the wicked, as an instance of whose felicity it is mentioned in\nanother place that without languishing for any long time “they go down to\nthe grave in a moment?”(1029) Where is that great stability of the saints,\nwhom David himself, in the language of complaint, frequently represents as\nnot only troubled, but oppressed and consumed? He certainly had in view,\nnot any thing that results from the agitations of the world, which are\neven more tumultuous than those of the sea, but what will be accomplished\nby the Lord, when he shall one day sit in judgment to fix the everlasting\ndestiny of heaven and earth. This appears from another psalm, in which he\ngives the following beautiful description: “They that trust in their\nwealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; none of\nthem can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for\nhim. For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish\nperson perish, and leave their wealth to others. Their inward thought is,\nthat their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling‐places to\nall generations; they call their lands after their own names. Nevertheless\nman being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. This\ntheir way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Like\nsheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the\nupright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty\nshall consume in the grave from their dwelling.”(1030) In the first place,\nthis derision of fools, for placing their dependence on the mutable and\ntransitory blessings of the world, shows that the wise ought to seek a\nvery different felicity. But he more evidently discloses the mystery of\nthe resurrection, when he establishes the reign of the pious after the\nruin and destruction of the wicked. For what shall we understand by “the\nmorning” which he mentions, but the revelation of a new life commencing\nafter the conclusion of the present?\nXVIII. Hence arose that reflection, which served the faithful as a\nconsolation under their miseries, and a remedy for their sufferings: “The\nanger of the Lord endureth but a moment; in his favour is life.”(1031) How\ndid they limit their afflictions to a moment, who were afflicted all their\nlifetime? When did they perceive so long a duration of the Divine\ngoodness, of which they had scarcely the smallest taste? If their views\nhad been confined to the earth, they could have made no such discovery;\nbut as they directed their eyes towards heaven, they perceived, that the\nafflictions with which the Lord exercises his saints are but “for a small\nmoment,” and that the “mercies” with which he “gathers” them are\n“everlasting.”(1032) On the other hand, they foresaw the eternal and\nnever‐ending perdition of the impious, who had been happy, as in a dream,\nfor a single day. Hence the following sentiments: “The memory of the just\nis blessed; but the name of the wicked shall rot.”(1033) “Precious in the\nsight of the Lord is the death of his saints.”(1034) Also in Samuel: “The\nLord will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in\ndarkness.”(1035) These expressions suggest to us, that they well knew,\nthat whatever vicissitudes may befall the saints, yet their last end will\nbe life and salvation; and that the prosperity of the impious is a\npleasant path, which gradually leads to the gulf of everlasting death.\nTherefore they called the death of such the “destruction of the\nuncircumcised,”(1036) as of those from whom all hope of resurrection had\nbeen cut off. Wherefore David could not conceive a more grievous\nimprecation than this: “Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,\nand not be written with the righteous.”(1037)\nXIX. But the following declaration of Job is remarkable beyond all others:\n“I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day\nupon the earth; and though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in\nmy flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall\nbehold, and not another.”(1038) Some, who wish to display their critical\nsagacity, cavil that this is not to be understood of the final\nresurrection, but even of the first day on which Job expected God to be\nmore propitious to him. Though we partly concede this, we shall extort an\nacknowledgment from them, whether they are willing or not, that Job could\nnever have attained to such an enlarged hope, if his thoughts had been\nconfined to the earth. We must, therefore, be obliged to confess that he,\nwho saw that his Redeemer would be present with him even when lying in the\nsepulchre, must have elevated his views to a future immortality. For to\nthem, who think only of the present life, death is a source of extreme\ndespair, which, however, could not annihilate his hope. “Though he slay\nme,” said he, “yet will I trust in him.”(1039) Nor let any trifler here\nobject, that these were the expressions of a few persons, and are far from\nfurnishing proof that such a doctrine was current among the Jews. I will\nimmediately reply, that these few persons did not in these declarations\nreveal any recondite wisdom, in which only superior understandings were\nseparately and privately instructed; but that the Holy Spirit having\nconstituted them teachers of the people, they publicly promulgated the\nDivine mysteries which were to be generally received, and to be the\nprinciples of the popular religion. When we hear the public oracles of the\nHoly Spirit, therefore, in which he has so clearly and evidently spoken of\nthe spiritual life in the Jewish church, it would be intolerable\nperverseness to apply them entirely to the carnal covenant, in which no\nmention is made but of the earth and earthly opulence.\nXX. If we descend to the later prophets, there we may freely expatiate as\nquite at home. For if it was not difficult to prove our point from David,\nJob, and Samuel, we shall do it there with much greater facility. For this\nis the order and economy which God observed in dispensing the covenant of\nhis mercy, that as the course of time accelerated the period of its full\nexhibition, he illustrated it from day to day with additional revelations.\nTherefore, in the beginning, when the first promise was given to Adam, it\nwas like the kindling of some feeble sparks. Subsequent accessions caused\na considerable enlargement of the light, which continued to increase more\nand more, and diffused its splendour through a wide extent, till at\nlength, every cloud being dissipated, Christ, the Sun of Righteousness,\ncompletely illuminated the whole world. There is no reason to fear,\ntherefore, if we want the suffrages of the prophets in support of our\ncause, that they will fail us. But as I perceive it would be a very\nextensive field, which would engross more of our attention than the nature\nof our design will admit,—for it would furnish matter for a large\nvolume,—and as I also think that by what has been already said, I have\nprepared the way even for a reader of small penetration to proceed without\nany difficulties, I shall abstain from a prolixity which at present is not\nvery necessary. I shall only caution the reader to advance with the clew\nwhich we have put into his hand; namely, that whenever the prophets\nmention the blessedness of the faithful, scarcely any vestiges of which\nare discernible in the present life, he should recur to this distinction;\nthat in order to the better elucidation of the Divine goodness, the\nprophets represented it to the people in a figurative manner; but that\nthey gave such a representation of it as would withdraw the mind from\nearth and time, and the elements of this world, all which must ere long\nperish, and would necessarily excite to a contemplation of the felicity of\nthe future spiritual life.\nXXI. We will content ourselves with one example. When the Israelites,\nafter being carried to Babylon, perceived how very much their dispersion\nresembled a death, they could scarcely be convinced that the prophecy of\nEzekiel concerning their restitution(1040) was not a mere fable; for they\nconsidered it in the same light, as if he had announced, that putrid\ncarcasses would be restored to life. The Lord, in order to show that even\nthat difficulty would not prevent him from displaying his beneficence,\ngave the prophet a vision of a field full of dry bones, which he\ninstantaneously restored to life and vigour solely by the power of his\nword. The vision served indeed to correct the existing incredulity; but at\nthe same time it reminded the Jews, how far the power of the Lord extended\nbeyond the restoration of the people, since the mere expression of his\nwill so easily reanimated the dry and dispersed bones. Wherefore you may\nproperly compare that passage with another of Isaiah: “Thy dead men shall\nlive; together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that\ndwell in dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall\ncast out the dead. Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut\nthy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until\nthe indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place\nto punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also\nshall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.”(1041)\nXXII. It would be absurd, however, to attempt to reduce every passage to\nsuch a canon of interpretation. For there are some places, which show\nwithout any disguise the future immortality which awaits the faithful in\nthe kingdom of God. Such are some which we have recited, and such are many\nothers, but particularly these two; one in Isaiah: “As the new heavens and\nthe new earth which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord,\nso shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that\nfrom one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all\nflesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. And they shall go forth,\nand look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me;\nfor their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.”(1042)\nAnd another in Daniel: “At that time shall Michael stand up, the great\nprince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a\ntime of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that\nsame time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that\nshall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the\ndust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame\nand everlasting contempt.”(1043)\nXXIII. Now, the two remaining points, that the fathers had Christ as the\npledge of their covenant, and that they reposed in him all their\nconfidence of the blessing, being less controvertible and more plain, I\nshall take no pains to prove them. We may safely conclude, therefore, what\nall the machinations of the devil can never subvert, that the Old\nTestament, or covenant which the Lord made with the Israelitish nation,\nwas not limited to terrestrial things, but contained a promise of\nspiritual and eternal life; the expectation of which must have been\nimpressed on the minds of all who truly consented to the covenant. Then\nlet us drive far away from us this absurd and pernicious notion, either\nthat the Lord proposed nothing else to the Jews, or that the Jews sought\nnothing else, but an abundance of food, carnal delights, flourishing\nwealth, external power, a numerous offspring, and whatever is esteemed\nvaluable by a natural man. For under the present dispensation, Christ\npromises to his people no other kingdom of heaven, than where they may sit\ndown with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;(1044) and Peter asserted the Jews of\nhis time to be heirs of the grace of the gospel, when he said that “they\nwere the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with\ntheir fathers.”(1045) And that this might not only be testified in words,\nthe Lord also proved it by a matter of fact. For on the day in which he\nrose from the dead, he honoured many of the saints with a participation of\nhis resurrection, and caused them to appear in the city;(1046) thus\nfurnishing a certain assurance that whatever he did and suffered for the\nacquisition of eternal salvation, belonged to the faithful of the Old\nTestament as much as to us. For, as Peter declares, they also were endued\nwith the same Spirit, who is the author of our regeneration to life.(1047)\nWhen we are informed that the same Spirit, which is as it were a spark of\nimmortality in us, and is therefore called in one place “the earnest of\nour inheritance,”(1048) dwelt in a similar manner in them, how can we dare\nto deprive them of the inheritance of eternal life? It is therefore the\nmore surprising, that the Sadducees formerly fell into such stupidity as\nto deny the resurrection, and the immortality of the soul, since they had\nproofs of these points from such clear testimonies of Scripture. And the\nfolly of the whole nation of the Jews in the present age, in expecting an\nearthly kingdom of the Messiah, would be equally extraordinary, had not\nthe Scriptures long before predicted that they would thus be punished for\ntheir rejection of the gospel. For it was consistent with the righteous\njudgment of God to strike with blindness the minds of those, who,\nrejecting the light of heaven when presented to them, kept themselves in\nvoluntary darkness. Therefore they read Moses, and assiduously turn over\nhis pages, but are prevented by an interposing veil from perceiving the\nlight which beams in his countenance;(1049) and thus it will remain\ncovered and concealed to them, till they are converted to Christ, from\nwhom they now endeavour as much as they can to withdraw and divert it."

          "title": "Chapter XI. The Difference Of The Two Testaments.",
          "content": "What, then, it will be said, will there be no difference left between the\nOld Testament and the New? and what becomes of all those passages of\nScripture, where they are compared together as things that are very\ndifferent? I readily admit the differences which are mentioned in the\nScripture, but I maintain that they derogate nothing from the unity\nalready established; as will be seen when we have discussed them in proper\norder. But the principal differences, as far as my observation or memory\nextends, are four in number; to which if any one choose to add a fifth, I\nshall not make the least objection. I assert, and engage to demonstrate,\nthat all these are such as pertain rather to the mode of administration,\nthan to the substance. In this view, they will not prevent the promises of\nthe Old and New Testament from remaining the same, and the promises of\nboth Testaments from having in Christ the same foundation. Now, the first\ndifference is, that although it was always the will of the Lord that the\nminds of his people should be directed, and their hearts elevated, towards\nthe celestial inheritance, yet, in order that they might be the better\nencouraged to hope for it, he anciently exhibited it for their\ncontemplation and partial enjoyment under the figures of terrestrial\nblessings. Now, having by the gospel more clearly and explicitly revealed\nthe grace of the future life, he leaves the inferior mode of instruction\nwhich he used with the Israelites, and directs our minds to the immediate\ncontemplation of it. Those who overlook this design of God, suppose that\nthe ancients ascended no higher than the corporeal blessings which were\npromised them; they so frequently hear the land of Canaan mentioned as the\neminent, and indeed the only, reward for the observers of the Divine law.\nThey hear that God threatens the transgressors of this law with nothing\nmore severe than being expelled from the possession of that country, and\ndispersed into foreign lands. They see this to be nearly the whole\nsubstance of all the blessings and of all the curses pronounced by Moses.\nHence they confidently conclude, that the Jews were separated from other\nnations, not for their own sakes, but for ours, that the Christian Church\nmight have an image, in whose external form they could discern examples of\nspiritual things. But since the Scripture frequently shows, that God\nhimself appointed the terrestrial advantages with which he favoured them\nfor the express purpose of leading them to the hope of celestial\nblessings, it argued extreme inexperience, not to say stupidity, not to\nconsider such a dispensation. The point of controversy between us and\nthese persons, is this: they maintain that the possession of the land of\nCanaan was accounted by the Israelites their supreme and ultimate\nblessedness, but that to us, since the revelation of Christ, it is a\nfigure of the heavenly inheritance. We, on the contrary, contend, that in\nthe earthly possession which they enjoyed, they contemplated, as in a\nmirror, the future inheritance which they believed to be prepared for them\nin heaven.\nII. This will more fully appear from the similitude which Paul has used in\nhis Epistle to the Galatians.(1050) He compares the Jewish nation to a\nyoung heir, who, being yet incapable of governing himself, follows the\ndictates of a tutor or a governor, to whose charge he has been committed.\nHis application of this similitude chiefly to the ceremonies, is no\nobjection against the propriety of its application to our present purpose.\nThe same inheritance was destined for them as for us; but they were not of\na sufficient age to be capable of entering on the possession and\nmanagement of it. The Church among them was the same as among us; but it\nwas yet in a state of childhood. Therefore the Lord kept them under this\ntuition, that he might give them the spiritual promises, not open and\nunconcealed, but veiled under terrestrial figures. Therefore, when he\nadmitted Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with their posterity, to the hope of\nimmortality, he promised them the land of Canaan as their inheritance; not\nthat their hopes might terminate in that land, but that in the prospect of\nit they might exercise and confirm themselves in the hope of that true\ninheritance which was not yet visible. And that they might not be\ndeceived, a superior promise was given them, which proved that country not\nto be the highest blessing which God would bestow. Thus Abraham is not\npermitted to grow indolent after having received a promise of the land,\nbut a greater promise elevates his mind to the Lord. For he hears him\nsaying, “Abram, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.”(1051)\nHere we see that the Lord proposes himself to Abraham as his ultimate\nreward, that he may not seek an uncertain and transitory one in the\nelements of this world, but may consider that which can never fade away.\nGod afterwards annexes a promise of the land, merely as a symbol of his\nbenevolence, and a type of the heavenly inheritance. And that this was the\nopinion of the saints, is plain from their own language. Thus David rises\nfrom temporary blessings to that consummate and ultimate felicity. “My\nsoul longeth, yea, even fainteth, for the courts of the Lord.”(1052) “God\nis my portion for ever.”(1053) Again: “The Lord is the portion of mine\ninheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.”(1054) Again: “I cried\nunto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land\nof the living.”(1055) Persons who venture to express themselves thus,\ncertainly profess that in their hopes they rise above the world and all\npresent blessings. Nevertheless the prophets frequently describe this\nblessedness of the future world under the type which the Lord had given\nthem. In this sense we must understand the following passages: “The\nrighteous shall inherit the land;”(1056) “But the wicked shall be cut off\nfrom the earth;”(1057) and various predictions of Isaiah, which foretell\nthe future prosperity of Jerusalem, and the abundance that will be enjoyed\nin Zion. We see that all these things are inapplicable to the land of our\npilgrimage, or to the earthly Jerusalem, but that they belong to the true\ncountry of the faithful, and to that celestial city, where “the Lord\ncommanded the blessing, even life for evermore.”(1058)\nIII. This is the reason why the saints, under the Old Testament, are\nrepresented as holding this mortal life with its blessings in higher\nestimation than becomes us now. For although they well knew that they\nought not to rest in it as the end of their course, yet when they\nrecollected what characters of his grace the Lord had impressed on it, in\norder to instruct them in a manner suitable to their tender state, they\nfelt a greater degree of pleasure in it than if they had considered it\nmerely in itself. But as the Lord, in declaring his benevolence to the\nfaithful by present blessings, gave them, under these types and symbols, a\nfigurative exhibition of spiritual felicity, so, on the other hand, in\ncorporal punishments he exemplified his judgment against the reprobate.\nTherefore, as the favours of God were more conspicuous in earthly things,\nso also were his punishments. Injudicious persons, not considering this\nanalogy and harmony (so to speak) between the punishments and rewards,\nwonder at so great a variety in God, that in ancient times he was ready to\navenge all the transgressions of men by the immediate infliction of severe\nand dreadful punishments, but now, as if he had laid aside his ancient\nwrath, punishes with far less severity and frequency; and on this account\nthey almost adopt the notion of the Manichæans, that the God of the Old\nTestament is a different being from the God of the New. But we shall\neasily get rid of such difficulties, if we direct our attention to that\ndispensation of God, which I have observed; namely, that during that\nperiod, in which he gave the Israelites his covenant involved in some\ndegree of obscurity, he intended to signify and prefigure the grace of\nfuture and eternal felicity by terrestrial blessings, and the grievousness\nof spiritual death by corporal punishments.\nIV. Another difference between the Old Testament and the New consists in\nfigures, because the former, in the absence of the truth, displayed merely\nan image and shadow instead of the body; but the latter exhibits the\npresent truth and the substantial body.(1059) And this is generally\nmentioned wherever the New Testament is opposed to the Old, but is treated\nmore at large in the Epistle to the Hebrews than in any other place.(1060)\nThe apostle is there disputing against those who supposed that the\nobservance of the Mosaic law could not be abolished, without being\nfollowed by the total ruin of religion. To refute this error, he adduces\nthe prediction of the psalmist concerning the priesthood of Christ;(1061)\nfor since he has an eternal priesthood committed to him, we may argue the\ncertain abolition of that priesthood, in which new priests daily succeeded\neach other.(1062) But he proves the superiority of the appointment of this\nnew Priest, because it is confirmed with an oath.(1063) He afterwards adds\nthat this transfer of the priesthood implies also a change of the\ncovenant.(1064) And he proves that this change was necessary, because such\nwas the imbecility of the law, that it could bring nothing to\nperfection.(1065) Then he proceeds to state the nature of this imbecility;\nnamely, that the law prescribed external righteousnesses, consisting in\ncarnal ordinances, which could not make the observers of them “perfect as\npertaining to the conscience,” that by animal victims it could neither\nexpiate sins nor procure true holiness.(1066) He concludes, therefore,\nthat it contained “a shadow of good things to come, but not the very image\nof the things;”(1067) and that consequently it had no other office, but to\nserve as an introduction to “a better hope,”(1068) which is exhibited in\nthe gospel. Here we have to inquire in what respect the Legal covenant is\ncompared with the Evangelical, the ministry of Christ with the ministry of\nMoses. For if the comparison related to the substance of the promises,\nthere would be a great discordance between the two testaments; but as the\nstate of the question leads us to a different point, we must attend to the\nscope of the apostle, in order to discover the truth. Let us, then, bring\nforward the covenant, which God has once made, which is eternal, and never\nto be abolished. The accomplishment, whence it derives its establishment\nand ratification, is Christ. While such a confirmation was waited for, the\nLord by Moses prescribed ceremonies, to serve as solemn symbols of the\nconfirmation. It came to be a subject of contention, whether the\nceremonies ordained in the law ought to cease and give place to Christ.\nNow, though these ceremonies were only accidents or concomitants of the\ncovenant, yet being the instruments of its administration, they bear the\nname of the covenant; as it is common to give to other sacraments the\nnames of the things they represent. In a word, therefore, what is here\ncalled the Old Testament is a solemn method of confirming the covenant,\nconsisting of ceremonies and sacrifices. Since it contains nothing\nsubstantial, unless we proceed further, the apostle contends that it ought\nto be repealed and abrogated, in order to make way for Christ, the Surety\nand Mediator of a better testament,(1069) by whom eternal sanctification\nhas been at once procured for the elect, and those transgressions\nobliterated, which remained under the law. Or, if you prefer it, take the\nfollowing statement of it; that the Old Testament of the Lord was that\nwhich was delivered to the Jews, involved in a shadowy and inefficacious\nobservance of ceremonies, and that it was therefore temporary, because it\nremained as it were in suspense, till it was supported by a firm and\nsubstantial confirmation; but that it was made new and eternal, when it\nwas consecrated and established by the blood of Christ. Whence Christ\ncalls the cup which he gives to his disciples in the supper, “the cup of\nthe New Testament in his blood;”(1070) to signify that when the testament\nof God is sealed with his blood, the truth of it is then accomplished, and\nthus it is made new and eternal.\nV. Hence it appears in what sense the apostle said, that the Jews were\nconducted to Christ by the tuition of the law, before he was manifested in\nthe flesh.(1071) He confesses also that they were children and heirs of\nGod, but such as, on account of their age, required to be kept under the\ncare of a tutor.(1072) For it was reasonable that before the Sun of\nRighteousness was risen, there should be neither such a full blaze of\nrevelation, nor such great clearness of understanding. Therefore the Lord\ndispensed the light of his word to them in such a manner, that they had\nyet only a distant and obscure prospect of it. Paul describes this\nslenderness of understanding as a state of childhood, which it was the\nLord’s will to exercise in the elements of this world and in external\nobservances, as rules of puerile discipline, till the manifestation of\nChrist, by whom the knowledge of the faithful was to grow to maturity.\nChrist himself alluded to this distinction, when he said, “The law and the\nprophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is\npreached.”(1073) What discoveries did Moses and the prophets make to their\ncontemporaries? They afforded them some taste of that wisdom which was in\nafter times to be clearly manifested, and gave them a distant prospect of\nits future splendour. But when Christ could be plainly pointed out, the\nkingdom of God was revealed. For in him are discovered “all the treasures\nof wisdom and knowledge,”(1074) by which we penetrate almost into the\nfurthest recesses of heaven.\nVI. Nor is it any objection to our argument, that scarcely a person can be\nfound in the Christian Church, who is to be compared with Abraham in the\nexcellency of his faith; or that the prophets were distinguished by such\nenergy of the Spirit as, even at this day, is sufficient to illuminate the\nwhole world. For our present inquiry is, not what grace the Lord has\nconferred on a few, but what is the ordinary method which he has pursued\nin the instruction of his people; such as is found even among the prophets\nthemselves, who were endued with peculiar knowledge above others. For\ntheir preaching is obscure, as relating to things very distant, and is\ncomprehended in types. Besides, notwithstanding their wonderful eminence\nin knowledge, yet because they were under a necessity of submitting to the\nsame tuition as the rest of the people, they are considered as sustaining\nthe character of children as well as others. Finally, none of them\npossessed knowledge so clear as not to partake more or less of the\nobscurity of the age. Whence this observation of Christ: “Many prophets\nand kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen\nthem; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard\nthem.”(1075) “Blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they\nhear.”(1076) And, indeed, it is reasonable that the presence of Christ\nshould be distinguished by the prerogative of introducing a clearer\nrevelation of the mysteries of heaven. To the same purpose also is the\npassage, which we have before cited from the First Epistle of Peter, that\nit was revealed to them, that the principal advantage of their labours\nwould be experienced in our times.(1077)\nVII. I come now to the third difference, which is taken from Jeremiah,\nwhose words are these: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will\nmake a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah;\nnot according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day\nthat I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which\nmy covenant they brake, although I was a husband to them, saith the Lord;\nbut this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.\nAfter those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts,\nand write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my\npeople. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every\nman his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me, from\nthe least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord; for I will\nforgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”(1078) From\nthis passage the apostle took occasion to institute the following\ncomparison between the law and the gospel: he calls the former a literal,\nthe latter a spiritual doctrine; the former, he says, was engraven on\ntables of stone, but the latter is inscribed on the heart;(1079) the\nformer was the preaching of death, but the latter of life; the former was\nthe ministration of condemnation, but the latter of righteousness; the\nformer is abolished, but the latter remains. As the design of the apostle\nwas to express the sense of the prophet, it will be sufficient for us to\nconsider the language of one of them, in order to discover the meaning of\nboth. There is, however, some difference between them. For the apostle\nspeaks of the law in less honourable terms than the prophet does; and that\nnot simply with respect to the law itself, but, because there were some\ndisturbers, who were full of improper zeal for the law, and by their\nperverse attachment to the ceremonies obscured the glory of the gospel, he\ndisputes concerning the nature of the law with reference to their error\nand foolish affection for it. This peculiarity in Paul, therefore, will be\nworthy of our observation. Both of them, as they contrast the Old and New\nTestaments with each other, consider nothing in the law, but what properly\nbelongs to it. For example, the law contains frequent promises of mercy;\nbut as they are borrowed from another dispensation, they are not\nconsidered as part of the law, when the mere nature of the law is the\nsubject of discussion. All that they attribute to it is, that it enjoins\nwhat is right, and prohibits crimes; that it proclaims a reward for the\nfollowers of righteousness, and denounces punishments against\ntransgressors; but that it neither changes nor corrects the depravity of\nheart which is natural to all men.\nVIII. Now, let us explain the comparison of the apostle in all its\nbranches. In the first place, the Old Testament is literal, because it was\npromulgated without the efficacy of the Spirit; the New is spiritual,\nbecause the Lord has engraven it in a spiritual manner on the hearts of\nmen. The second contrast, therefore, serves as an elucidation of the\nfirst. The Old Testament is the revelation of death, because it can only\ninvolve all mankind in a curse; the New is the instrument of life, because\nit delivers us from the curse, and restores us to favour with God. The\nformer is the ministry of condemnation, because it convicts all the\nchildren of Adam of unrighteousness; the latter is the ministry of\nrighteousness, because it reveals the mercy of God, by which we are made\nrighteous. The last contrast must be referred to the legal ceremonies. The\nlaw having an image of things that were at a distance, it was necessary\nthat in time it should be abolished and disappear. The gospel, exhibiting\nthe body itself, retains a firm and perpetual stability. Jeremiah calls\neven the moral law a weak and frail covenant, but for another reason;\nnamely, because it was soon broken by the sudden defection of an\nungrateful people. But as such a violation arises from the fault of the\npeople, it cannot be properly attributed to the Testament. The ceremonies,\nhowever, which at the advent of Christ were abolished by their own\nweakness, contained in themselves the cause of their abrogation. Now, this\ndifference between the “letter” and the “spirit” is not to be understood\nas if the Lord had given his law to the Jews without any beneficial\nresult, without one of them being converted to him; but it is used in a\nway of comparison, to display the plenitude of grace with which the same\nLegislator, assuming as it were a new character, has honoured the\npreaching of the gospel. For if we survey the multitude of those, from\namong all nations, whom, by the influence of his Spirit in the preaching\nof the gospel, the Lord has regenerated and gathered into communion with\nhis Church, we shall say that those of the ancient Israelites, who\ncordially and sincerely embraced the covenant of the Lord, were extremely\nfew; though, if estimated by themselves without any comparison, they\namounted to a considerable number.\nIX. The fourth difference arises out of the third. For the Scripture calls\nthe Old Testament a covenant of bondage, because it produces fear in the\nmind; but the New it describes as a covenant of liberty, because it leads\nthe heart to confidence and security. Thus Paul, in the eighth chapter of\nhis Epistle to the Romans, says, “Ye have not received the spirit of\nbondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,\nwhereby we cry, Abba, Father.”(1080) To the same purpose is that passage\nin the Epistle to the Hebrews, that the faithful now “are not come unto\nthe mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto\nblackness, and darkness, and tempest,” where nothing can be either heard\nor seen, but what must strike terror into the mind; so that even Moses\nhimself is exceedingly afraid at the sound of the terrible voice, which\nthey all pray that they may hear no more; but that now the faithful “are\ncome unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly\nJerusalem,”(1081) &c. What Paul briefly touches in the passage which we\nhave adduced from the Epistle to the Romans, he explains more at large in\nhis Epistle to the Galatians, when he allegorizes the two sons of Abraham\nin the following manner—that Agar, the bond‐woman, is a type of mount\nSinai, where the people of Israel received the law; that Sarah, the free‐\nwoman, is a figure of the celestial Jerusalem, whence proceeds the gospel.\nThat as the son of Agar is born in bondage, and can never attain to the\ninheritance, and the son of Sarah is born free, and has a right to the\ninheritance,(1082) so by the law we were devoted to slavery, but by the\ngospel alone are regenerated to liberty. Now, the whole may be summed up\nthus—that the Old Testament filled men’s consciences with fear and\ntrembling; but that by the benefit of the New Testament, they are\ndelivered, and enabled to rejoice. The former kept their consciences under\na yoke of severe bondage; but by the liberality of the latter they are\nemancipated and admitted to liberty. If any one object to us the case of\nthe holy fathers of the Israelitish people, that as they were clearly\npossessed of the same spirit of faith as we are, they must consequently\nhave been partakers of the same liberty and joy, we reply, that neither of\nthese originated from the law; but that, when they felt themselves, by\nmeans of the law, oppressed with their servile condition, and wearied with\ndisquietude of conscience, they fled for refuge to the gospel; and that\ntherefore it was a peculiar advantage of the New Testament, that they\nenjoyed an exception from the common law of the Old Testament, and were\nexempted from those evils. Besides, we shall deny that they were favoured\nwith the spirit of liberty and security, to such a degree as not to\nexperience from the law some measure both of fear and of servitude. For\nnotwithstanding their enjoyment of that privilege, which they obtained by\nthe grace of the gospel, yet they were subject to the same observances and\nburdens as the people in general. As they were obliged, therefore, to a\ndiligent observance of these ceremonies, which were emblems of the state\nof pupilage similar to bondage, and the hand‐writing, by which they\nconfessed themselves guilty of sin, did not release them from the\nobligation, they may justly be said, in comparison with us, to have been\nunder a testament of bondage and fear, when we consider the common mode of\nprocedure which the Lord then pursued with the Israelitish nation.\nX. The three last comparisons which we have mentioned are between the law\nand the gospel. In these, therefore, “the Old Testament” denotes _the\nlaw_; and “the New Testament,” _the gospel_. The first comparison extends\nfurther, for it comprehends also the promises, which were given before the\nlaw. When Augustine denied that they ought to be considered as part of the\nOld Testament, he gave a very proper opinion, and intended the same that\nwe now teach; for he had in view those passages of Jeremiah and Paul, in\nwhich the Old Testament is distinguished from the word of grace and mercy.\nHe very judiciously adds also in the same place, that the children of the\npromise, from the beginning of the world, who have been regenerated by\nGod, and, under the influence of faith working by love, have obeyed his\ncommands, belong to the New Testament; and _that_, in hope, not of carnal,\nterrestrial, and temporal things, but of spiritual, celestial, and eternal\nblessings; especially believing in the Mediator, through whom they doubted\nnot that the Spirit was dispensed to them to enable them to do their duty,\nand that whenever they sinned they were pardoned. For this is the very\nsame thing which I meant to assert: That all the saints, whom, from the\nbeginning of the world, the Scripture mentions as having been peculiarly\nchosen by God, have been partakers of the same blessing with us to eternal\nsalvation. Between our distinction and that of Augustine there is this\ndifference—that ours (according to this declaration of Christ, “the law\nand the prophets were until John; since that time the kingdom of God is\npreached;”)(1083) distinguishes between the clearness of the gospel and\nthe more obscure dispensation of the word which preceded it; whilst the\nother merely discriminates the weakness of the law from the stability of\nthe gospel. Here it must also be remarked concerning the holy fathers,\nthat though they lived under the Old Testament, they did not rest\nsatisfied with it, but always aspired after the New, and thus enjoyed a\ncertain participation of it. For all those who contented themselves with\npresent shadows, and did not extend their views to Christ, are condemned\nby the apostle as blind and under the curse. For, to say nothing on other\npoints, what greater ignorance can be imagined than to hope for an\nexpiation of sin by the sacrifice of an animal? than to seek for the\npurification of the soul by an external ablution with water? than to wish\nto appease God with frigid ceremonies, as though they afforded him great\npleasure? For all these absurdities are chargeable on those who adhere to\nthe observances of the law, without any reference to Christ.\nXI. The fifth difference, which we may add, consists in this—that till the\nadvent of Christ, the Lord selected one nation, to which he would limit\nthe covenant of his grace. Moses says, “When the Most High divided to the\nnations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam,—the Lord’s\nportion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.”(1084) In\nanother place he thus addresses the people: “Behold, the heaven, and the\nheaven of heavens is the Lord’s thy God, the earth also, with all that\ntherein is. Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and\nhe chose their seed after them, even you above all people.”(1085)\nTherefore he favoured that people with the exclusive knowledge of his\nname, as though they alone of all mankind belonged to him; he deposited\nhis covenant as it were in their bosom; to them he manifested the presence\nof his power; he honoured them with every privilege. But to omit the rest\nof his benefits, the only one that relates to our present argument is,\nthat he united them to himself by the communication of his word, in order\nthat he might be denominated and esteemed their God. In the mean time he\nsuffered other nations, as though they had no business or intercourse with\nhim, to walk in vanity;(1086) nor did he employ means to prevent their\ndestruction by sending them the only remedy—the preaching of his word. The\nIsraelitish nation, therefore, were then as darling sons; others were\nstrangers: they were known to him, and received under his faithful\nprotection; others were left to their own darkness: they were sanctified\nby God; others were profane: they were honoured with the Divine presence;\nothers were excluded from approaching it. But when the fulness of the time\nwas come,(1087) appointed for the restoration of all things,(1088) and the\nReconciler of God and men was manifested,(1089) the barrier was\ndemolished, which had so long confined the Divine mercy within the limits\nof the Jewish church, and peace was announced to them who were at a\ndistance, and to them who were near, that being both reconciled to God,\nthey might coalesce into one people. Wherefore “there is neither Greek nor\nJew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, but Christ is all and in all;”(1090)\n“to whom the heathen are given for his inheritance, and the uttermost\nparts of the earth for his possession;”(1091) that he may have a universal\n“dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the\nearth.”(1092)\nXII. The vocation of the Gentiles, therefore, is an eminent illustration\nof the superior excellence of the New Testament above the Old. It had,\nindeed, before been most explicitly announced in numerous predictions of\nthe prophets; but so as that the completion of it was deferred to the\nkingdom of the Messiah. And even Christ himself made no advances towards\nit at the first commencement of his preaching, but deferred it till he\nshould have completed all the parts of our redemption, finished the time\nof his humiliation, and received from the Father “a name which is above\nevery name, before which every knee shall bow.”(1093) Wherefore, when this\nseason was not yet arrived, he said to a Canaanitish woman, “I am not sent\nbut unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel:”(1094) nor did he permit\nthe apostles, in his first mission of them, to exceed these limits. “Go\nnot,” says he, “into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the\nSamaritans enter ye not; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of\nIsrael.”(1095) And though this calling of the Gentiles was announced by so\nmany testimonies, yet when the apostles were about to enter upon it, it\nappeared to them so novel and strange, that they dreaded it, as if it had\nbeen a prodigy: indeed it was with trepidation and reluctance that they at\nlength engaged in it. Nor is this surprising; for it seemed not at all\nreasonable, that the Lord, who for so many ages had separated the\nIsraelites from the rest of the nations, should, as it were, suddenly\nchange his design, and annihilate this distinction. It had indeed been\npredicted in the prophecies; but they could not pay such great attention\nto the prophecies, as to be wholly unmoved with the novelty of the\ncircumstance, which forced itself on their observation. Nor were the\nspecimens, which the Lord had formerly given, of the future vocation of\nthe Gentiles, sufficient to influence them. For besides his having called\nonly very few of them, he had even incorporated them into the family of\nAbraham, that they might be added to his people; but by that public\nvocation, the Gentiles were not only raised to an equality with the Jews,\nbut appeared to succeed to their places as though they had been dead.\nBesides, of all the strangers whom God had before incorporated into the\nChurch, none were ever placed on an equality with the Jews. Therefore it\nis not without reason that Paul so celebrates this “mystery which was\nhidden from ages and from generations,”(1096) and which he represents as\nan object of admiration even to angels.(1097)\nXIII. In these four or five points, I think I have given a correct and\nfaithful statement of the whole of the difference between the Old and the\nNew Testament, as far as is sufficient for a simple system of doctrine.\nBut because some persons represent this variety in the government of the\nChurch, these different modes of instruction, and such a considerable\nalteration of rites and ceremonies, as a great absurdity, we must reply to\nthem, before we proceed to other subjects. And this may be done in a brief\nmanner, since the objections are not so strong as to require a laborious\nrefutation. It is not reasonable, they say, that God, who is perpetually\nconsistent with himself, should undergo so great a change as afterwards to\ndisallow what he had once enjoined and commanded. I reply, that God ought\nnot therefore to be deemed mutable, because he has accommodated different\nforms to different ages, as he knew would be suitable for each. If the\nhusbandman prescribes different employments to his family in the winter,\nfrom those which he allots them in the summer, we must not therefore\naccuse him of inconstancy, or impute to him a deviation from the proper\nrules of agriculture, which are connected with the perpetual course of\nnature. Thus, also, if a father instructs, governs, and manages his\nchildren one way in infancy, another in childhood, and another in youth,\nwe must not therefore charge him with being inconstant, or forsaking his\nown designs. Why, then, do we stigmatize God with the character of\ninconstancy, because he has made an apt and suitable distinction between\ndifferent times? The last similitude ought fully to satisfy us. Paul\ncompares the Jews to children, and Christians to youths.(1098) What\nimpropriety is there in this part of the government of God, that he\ndetained them in the rudiments which were suitable to them on account of\ntheir age, but has placed us under a stronger and more manly discipline?\nIt is a proof, therefore, of the constancy of God, that he has delivered\nthe same doctrine in all ages, and perseveres in requiring the same\nworship of his name which he commanded from the beginning. By changing the\nexternal form and mode, he has discovered no mutability in himself, but\nhas so far accommodated himself to the capacity of men, which is various\nand mutable.\nXIV. But they inquire whence this diversity proceeded, except from the\nwill of God. Could he not, as well from the beginning as since the advent\nof Christ, give a revelation of eternal life in clear language without any\nfigures, instruct his people by a few plain sacraments, bestow his Holy\nSpirit, and diffuse his grace through all the world? This is just the same\nas if they were to quarrel with God, because he created the world at so\nlate a period, whereas he might have done it before; or because he has\nappointed the alternate vicissitudes of summer and winter, of day and\nnight. But let us not doubt what ought to be believed by all pious men,\nthat whatever is done by God is done wisely and righteously; although we\nfrequently know nothing of the causes which render such transactions\nnecessary. For it would be arrogating too much to ourselves, not to permit\nGod to keep the reasons of his decrees concealed from us. But it is\nsurprising, say they, that he now rejects and abominates the sacrifices of\ncattle, and all the apparatus of the Levitical priesthood, with which he\nused to be delighted; as though truly these external and transitory things\ncould afford pleasure to God, or affect him in any way whatever. It has\nalready been observed, that he did none of these things on his own\naccount, but appointed them all for the salvation of men. If a physician\ncure a young man of any disease by a very excellent method, and afterwards\nadopt a different mode of cure with the same person when advanced in\nyears, shall we therefore say that he rejects the method of cure which he\nbefore approved? We will rather say, that he perseveres in the same\nsystem, and considers the difference of age. Thus it was necessary, before\nthe appearance of Christ, that he should be prefigured, and his future\nadvent announced by one kind of emblems; since he has been manifested, it\nis right that he should be represented by others. But with respect to the\nDivine vocation, now more widely extended among all nations since the\nadvent of Christ than it was before, and with regard to the more copious\neffusion of the graces of the Spirit, who can deny, that it is reasonable\nand just for God to retain under his own power and will the free\ndispensation of his favours; that he may illuminate what nations he\npleases; that wherever he pleases he may introduce the preaching of his\nword; that he may give to his instruction whatever kind and degree of\nprofit and success he pleases; that wherever he pleases, in any age, he\nmay punish the ingratitude of the world by depriving them of the knowledge\nof his name, and when he pleases restore it on account of his mercy? We\nsee, therefore, the absurdity of the cavils with which impious men disturb\nthe minds of the simple on this subject, to call in question either the\nrighteousness of God or the truth of the Scripture."

          "title": "Chapter XII. The Necessity Of Christ Becoming Man In Order To Fulfil The",
          "content": "Office Of Mediator.\nIt was of great importance to our interests, that he, who was to be our\nMediator, should be both true God and true man. If an inquiry be made\nconcerning the necessity of this, it was not indeed a simple, or, as we\ncommonly say, an absolute necessity, but such as arose from the heavenly\ndecree, on which the salvation of men depended. But our most merciful\nFather has appointed that which was best for us. For since our iniquities,\nlike a cloud intervening between us and him, had entirely alienated us\nfrom the kingdom of heaven, no one that could not approach to God could be\na mediator for the restoration of peace. But who could have approached to\nhim? Could any one of the children of Adam? They, with their parent, all\ndreaded the Divine presence. Could any one of the angels? They also stood\nin need of a head, by a connection with whom they might be confirmed in a\nperfect and unvarying adherence to their God. What, then, could be done?\nOur situation was truly deplorable, unless the Divine majesty itself would\ndescend to us; for we could not ascend to it. Thus it was necessary that\nthe Son of God should become Immanuel, that is, God with us; and this in\norder that there might be a mutual union and coalition between his\nDivinity and the nature of man; for otherwise the proximity could not be\nsufficiently near, nor could the affinity be sufficiently strong, to\nauthorize us to hope that God would dwell with us. So great was the\ndiscordance between our pollution and the perfect purity of God. Although\nman had remained immaculately innocent, yet his condition would have been\ntoo mean for him to approach to God without a Mediator. What, then, can he\ndo, after having been plunged by his fatal fall into death and hell,\ndefiled with so many blemishes, putrefying in his own corruption, and, in\na word, overwhelmed with every curse? It is not without reason, therefore,\nthat Paul, when about to exhibit Christ in the character of a Mediator,\nexpressly speaks of him as a man. “There is one Mediator,” he says,\n“between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.”(1099) He might have called\nhim God, or might indeed have omitted the appellation of man, as well as\nthat of God; but because the Spirit, who spake by him, knew our infirmity,\nhe has provided a very suitable remedy against it, by placing the Son of\nGod familiarly among us, as though he were one of us. Therefore, that no\none may distress himself where he is to seek the Mediator, or in what way\nhe may approach him, the apostle, by denominating him a man, apprizes us\nthat he is near, and even close to us, since he is our own flesh. He\ncertainly intends the same as is stated in another place more at\nlarge—“that we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the\nfeeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are,\nyet without sin.”(1100)\nII. This will still more fully appear, if we consider, that it was no mean\npart which the Mediator had to perform; namely, to restore us to the\nDivine favour, so as, of children of men, to make us children of God; of\nheirs of hell, to make us heirs of the kingdom of heaven. Who could\naccomplish this, unless the Son of God should become also the Son of man,\nand thus receive to himself what belongs to us, and transfer to us that\nwhich is his, and make that which is his by nature ours by grace?\nDepending, therefore, on this pledge, we have confidence that we are the\nchildren from God, because he, who is the Son of God by nature, has\nprovided himself a body from our body, flesh from our flesh, bones from\nour bones,(1101) that he might be the same with us: he refused not to\nassume that which was peculiar to us, that we also might obtain that which\nhe had peculiar to him; and that so in common with us he might be both the\nSon of God and the Son of man. Hence arises that holy fraternity, which he\nmentions with his own mouth in the following words: “I ascend unto my\nFather, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.”(1102) On this\naccount we have a certainty of the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven,\nbecause the only Son of God, to whom it exclusively belonged, has adopted\nus as his brethren; and if we are his brethren, we are consequently co‐\nheirs to the inheritance.(1103) Moreover it was highly necessary also for\nthis reason, that he who was to be our Redeemer should be truly both God\nand man. It was his office to swallow up death; who could do this, but he\nwho was life itself? It was his to overcome sin; who could accomplish\nthis, but righteousness itself? It was his to put to flight the powers of\nthe world and of the air; who could do this, but a power superior both to\nthe world and to the air? Now, who possesses life or righteousness, or the\nempire and power of heaven, but God alone? Therefore the most merciful\nGod, when he determined on our redemption, became himself our Redeemer in\nthe person of his only begotten Son!\nIII. Another branch of our reconciliation with God was this—that man, who\nhad ruined himself by his own disobedience, should remedy his condition by\nobedience, should satisfy the justice of God, and suffer the punishment of\nhis sin. Our Lord then made his appearance as a real man; he put on the\ncharacter of Adam, and assumed his name, to act as his substitute in his\nobedience to the Father, to lay down our flesh as the price of\nsatisfaction to the justice of God; and to suffer the punishment which we\nhad deserved, in the same nature in which the offence had been committed.\nAs it would have been impossible, therefore, for one who was only God to\nsuffer death, or for one who was a mere man to overcome it, he associated\nthe human nature with the Divine, that he might submit the weakness of the\nformer to death, as an atonement for sins; and that with the power of the\nlatter he might contend with death, and obtain a victory on our behalf.\nThose who despoil Christ, therefore, either of his Divinity or his\nhumanity, either diminish his majesty and glory, or obscure his goodness.\nNor are they, on the other hand, less injurious to men, whose faith they\nweaken and subvert; since it cannot stand any longer than it rests upon\nthis foundation. Moreover, the Redeemer to be expected was that Son of\nAbraham and David, whom God had promised in the law and the prophets.\nHence the minds of the faithful derive another advantage, because from the\ncircumstance of his ancestry being traced to David and to Abraham, they\nhave an additional assurance that this is the Christ, who was celebrated\nin so many prophecies. But we should particularly remember, what I have\njust stated—that our common nature is a pledge of our fellowship with the\nSon of God; that, clothed in our flesh, he vanquished sin and death, in\norder that the victory and triumph might be ours; that the flesh which he\nreceived from us he offered up as a sacrifice, in order to expiate and\nobliterate our guilt, and appease the just wrath of the Father.\nIV. The persons who consider these things, with the diligent attention\nwhich they deserve, will easily disregard vague speculations which attract\nminds that are inconstant and fond of novelty. Such is the notion, that\nChrist would have become man, even though the human race had needed no\nredemption. I grant, indeed, that at the original creation, and in the\nstate of integrity, he was exalted as head over angels and men; for which\nreason Paul calls him “the first‐born of every creature;”(1104) but since\nthe whole Scriptures proclaim, that he was clothed in flesh in order to\nbecome a Redeemer, it argues excessive temerity to imagine another cause\nor another end for it. The end for which Christ was promised from the\nbeginning, is sufficiently known; it was to restore a fallen world, and to\nsuccour ruined men. Therefore under the law his image was exhibited in\nsacrifices, to inspire the faithful with a hope that God would be\npropitious to them, after he should be reconciled by the expiation of\ntheir sins. And as, in all ages, even before the promulgation of the law,\nthe Mediator was never promised without blood, we conclude that he was\ndestined by the eternal decree of God to purify the pollution of men;\nbecause the effusion of blood is an emblem of expiation. The prophets\nproclaimed and foretold him, as the future reconciler of God and men. As a\nsufficient specimen of all, we refer to that very celebrated testimony of\nIsaiah, where he predicts, that he should be smitten of God for the\ntransgressions of the people, that the chastisement of their peace might\nbe upon him; and that he should be a priest to offer up himself as a\nvictim; that by his stripes others should be healed; and that because all\nmen had gone astray, and been dispersed like sheep, it had pleased the\nLord to afflict him and to lay on him the iniquities of all.(1105) As we\nare informed that Christ is particularly appointed by God for the relief\nof miserable sinners, all who pass these bounds are guilty of indulging a\nfoolish curiosity. When he himself appeared in the world, he declared the\ndesign of his advent to be, to appease God and restore us from death to\nlife. The apostles testified the same. Thus John, before he informs us\nthat the Word was made flesh, mentions the defection of man.(1106) But our\nprincipal attention is due to Christ himself speaking of his own office.\nHe says, “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting\nlife.”(1107) Again: “The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall\nhear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.”(1108) “I\nam the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were\ndead, yet shall he live.”(1109) Again: “The Son of man is come to save\nthat which was lost.”(1110) Again: “They that be whole need not a\nphysician.”(1111) There would be no end, if I meant to quote all the\npassages. The apostles with one consent call us back to this principle;\nfor certainly, if he had not come to reconcile God, the honour of his\npriesthood would have been lost, for a priest is appointed as a Mediator\nto intercede between God and men:(1112) he could not have been our\nrighteousness, because he was made a sacrifice for us, that God might not\nimpute sins to us.(1113) Finally, he would have been despoiled of all the\nnoble characters under which he is celebrated in the Scripture. This\nassertion of Paul would have no foundation: “What the law could not do,\nGod, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,\ncondemned sin in the flesh.”(1114) Nor would there be any truth in what he\nteaches in another place, that “the kindness and love of God our Saviour\ntowards man appeared”(1115) in the gift of Christ as a Redeemer. To\nconclude, the Scripture no where assigns any other end, for which the Son\nof God should choose to become incarnate, and should also receive this\ncommand from the Father, than that he might be made a sacrifice to appease\nthe Father on our account. “Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ\nto suffer; and that repentance should be preached in his name.”(1116)\n“Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life. This\ncommandment have I received of my Father.”(1117) “As Moses lifted up the\nserpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted\nup.”(1118) Again: “Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came\nI unto this hour.”(1119) “Father, glorify thy Son.”(1120) Where he clearly\nassigns, as the end of his assumption of human nature, that it was to be\nan expiatory sacrifice for the abolition of sins. For the same reason,\nZacharias pronounces that he is come, according to the promise given to\nthe fathers, “to give light to them that sit in the shadow of\ndeath.”(1121) Let us remember that all these things are spoken of the Son\nof God, “in whom,” according to the testimony of Paul, “are hidden all the\ntreasures of wisdom and knowledge,”(1122) and besides whom he glories in\nknowing nothing.(1123)\nV. If any one object, that it is not evinced by any of these things, that\nthe same Christ, who has redeemed men from condemnation, could not have\ntestified his love to them by assuming their nature, if they had remained\nin a state of integrity and safety,—we briefly reply, that since the\nSpirit declares these two things, Christ’s becoming our Redeemer, and his\nparticipation of the same nature, to have been connected by the eternal\ndecree of God, it is not right to make any further inquiry. For he who\nfeels an eager desire to know something more, not being content with the\nimmutable appointment of God, shows himself also not to be contented with\nthis Christ, who has been given to us as the price of our redemption. Paul\nnot only tells us the end of his mission, but ascending to the sublime\nmystery of predestination, very properly represses all the licentiousness\nand prurience of the human mind, by declaring, that “the Father hath\nchosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world, and predestinated\nus to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will,\nand made us accepted in his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption\nthrough his blood.”(1124) Here the fall of Adam is certainly not\npresupposed, as of anterior date; but we have a discovery of what was\ndecreed by God before all ages, when he determined to remedy the misery of\nmankind. If any adversary object again, that this design of God depended\non the fall of man, which he foresaw, it is abundantly sufficient for me,\nthat every man is proceeding with impious presumption to imagine to\nhimself a new Christ, whoever he be that permits himself to inquire, or\nwishes to know, concerning Christ, any more than God has predestinated in\nhis secret decree. And justly does Paul, after having been thus treating\nof the peculiar office of Christ, implore, on behalf of the Ephesians, the\nspirit of understanding, “that they may be able to comprehend what is the\nbreadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of\nChrist, which passeth knowledge;”(1125) as though he would labour to\nsurround our minds with barriers, that wherever mention is made of Christ,\nthey may not decline in the smallest degree from the grace of\nreconciliation. Wherefore, since “this is” testified by Paul to be “a\nfaithful saying, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save\nsinners,”(1126) I gladly acquiesce in it. And since the same apostle in\nanother place informs us, that “the grace, which is now made manifest by\nthe gospel, was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,”(1127) I\nconclude that I ought to persevere in the same doctrine with constancy to\nthe end. This modesty is unreasonably censured by Osiander, who in the\npresent age has unhappily agitated this question, which a few persons had\nslightly touched before. He alleges a charge of presumption against those\nwho deny that the Son of God would have appeared in the flesh, if Adam had\nnever fallen, because this tenet is contradicted by no testimony of\nScripture; as if Paul laid no restraint on such perverse curiosity, when,\nafter having spoken of the accomplishment of our redemption by Christ, he\nimmediately adds this injunction: “Avoid foolish questions.”(1128) The\nfrenzy of some, that have been desirous of appearing prodigiously acute,\nhas proceeded to such a length as to question whether the Son of God could\nassume the nature of an ass. This monstrous supposition, which all pious\npersons justly abhor and detest, Osiander excuses under this pretext, that\nit is nowhere in Scripture expressly condemned; as if, when Paul esteems\nnothing valuable or worthy of being known but Christ crucified, he would\nadmit an ass to be the author of salvation! Therefore he who in another\nplace declares that Christ was appointed by the eternal decree of the\nFather as “the head over all,”(1129) would never acknowledge any other who\nhad not been appointed to the office of a Redeemer.\nVI. But the principle which he boasts is altogether frivolous. He\nmaintains that man was created in the image of God, because he was formed\nin the similitude of the future Messiah, that he might resemble him whom\nthe Father had already decreed to clothe with flesh. Whence he concludes\nthat if Adam had never fallen from his primitive integrity, Christ would\nnevertheless have become man. How nugatory and forced this is, all who\npossess a sound judgment readily perceive. But he supposes that he has\nbeen the first to discover wherein the Divine image consisted; namely,\nthat the glory of God not only shone in those eminent talents with which\nman was endued, but that God himself essentially resided in him. Now,\nthough I admit that Adam bore the Divine image, inasmuch as he was united\nto God, which is the true and consummate perfection of dignity, yet I\ncontend that the similitude of God is to be sought only in those\ncharacters of excellence, with which God distinguished Adam above the\nother creatures. And that Christ was even then the image of God, is\nuniversally allowed; and therefore whatever excellence was impressed on\nAdam proceeded from this circumstance, that he approached to the glory of\nhis Maker by means of his only begotten Son. Man, therefore, was made in\nthe image of God, and was designed to be a mirror to display the glory of\nhis Creator. He was exalted to this degree of honour by the favour of the\nonly begotten Son; but I add, that this Son was a common head to angels as\nwell as to men; so that the angels also were entitled to the same dignity\nwhich was conferred on man. And when we hear them called the “children of\nGod,”(1130) it would be unreasonable to deny that they have some\nresemblance to their Father. But if he designed his glory to be\nrepresented in angels as well as in men, and to be equally conspicuous in\nthe angelic as in the human nature, Osiander betrays his ignorance and\nfolly in saying that men were preferred to angels, because the latter did\nnot bear the image of Christ. For they could not constantly enjoy the\npresent contemplation of God, unless they were like him. And Paul teaches\nus that men are no otherwise renewed after the image of God, than that if\nthey be associated with angels, they may be united together under one\nhead.(1131) Finally, if we give credit to Christ, our ultimate felicity,\nwhen we shall be received into heaven, will consist in being conformed to\nthe angels. But if Osiander may infer, that the primary exemplar of the\nDivine image was taken from the human nature of Christ, with the same\njustice may any other person contend, that Christ must have been a\npartaker of the nature of angels, because they likewise possess the image\nof God.\nVII. Osiander, then, has no reason to fear, that God might possibly be\nproved a liar, unless the decree concerning the incarnation of his Son had\nbeen previously and immutably fixed in his mind. Because, though Adam had\nnot fallen from his integrity, yet he would have resembled God just as the\nangels do; and yet it would not have been necessary on that account for\nthe Son of God to become either a man or an angel. Nor has he any cause to\nfear this absurdity, that if God had not immutably decreed, before the\ncreation of man, that Christ should be born, not as a Redeemer, but as the\nfirst man, he might lose his prerogative; whereas now he would not have\nbecome incarnate but for an accidental cause, that is, to restore mankind\nfrom ruin; so that he might thence infer, that Christ was created after\nthe image of Adam. For why should he dread, what the Scripture so plainly\nteaches, that he was made like us in all things, sin excepted?(1132)\nwhence also Luke hesitates not in his genealogy to call him “the son of\nAdam.”(1133) I would also wish to know why Paul styles Christ “the second\nAdam,”(1134) but because he was destined to become man, in order to\nextricate the posterity of Adam from ruin. If he sustained that capacity\nbefore the creation, he ought to have been called “the first Adam.”\nOsiander boldly affirms, that because Christ was already foreknown as man\nin the Divine mind, therefore men were formed in his likeness. But Paul,\nby denominating him “the second Adam,” places the fall, whence arises the\nnecessity of restoring our nature to its primitive condition, in an\nintermediate point between the first original of mankind and the\nrestitution which we obtain through Christ; whence it follows that the\nfall was the cause of the incarnation of the Son of God. Now, Osiander\nargues unreasonably and impertinently, that while Adam retained his\nintegrity, he would be the image of himself, and not of Christ. On the\ncontrary, I reply, that although the Son of God had never been incarnate,\nboth the body and the soul of man would equally have displayed the image\nof God; in whose radiance it always appeared, that Christ was truly the\nhead, possessing the supremacy over all. And thus we destroy that futile\nsubtilty raised by Osiander, that the angels would have been destitute of\nthis head, unless God had decreed to clothe his Son with flesh, even\nwithout any transgression of Adam. For he too inconsiderately takes for\ngranted, what no wise man will concede, that Christ has no supremacy over\nangels, and that he is not their Prince, except in his human nature. But\nwe may easily conclude, from the language of Paul, that, as the eternal\nWord of God, he is “the first‐born of every creature;”(1135) not that he\nwas created, or ought to be numbered among creatures, but because the holy\nstate of the world, adorned as it was at the beginning with consummate\nbeauty, had no other author; and that afterwards, as man, he was “the\nfirst begotten from the dead.” For in one short passage he proposes to our\nconsideration both these points—that all things were created by the Son,\nthat he might have dominion over angels; and that he was made man, that he\nmight become our Redeemer.(1136) Another proof of Osiander’s ignorance is\nhis assertion, that men would not have had Christ for their King, if he\nhad not been incarnate; as though the kingdom of God could not subsist, if\nthe eternal Son of God, without being invested with humanity, uniting\nangels and men in the participation of his glorious life, had himself held\nthe supreme dominion! But he is always deceived, or rather bewilders\nhimself, in this false principle, that the Church would have been\ndestitute of a head, if Christ had not been manifested in the flesh; as\nif, while he was head over angels, he could not likewise by his Divine\npower preside over men, and by the secret energy of his Spirit animate and\nsupport them, like his own body, till they should be exalted to heaven,\nand enjoy the life of angels! These impertinencies, which I have thus far\nrefuted, Osiander esteems as incontrovertible oracles. Inebriated by the\ncharms of his own speculations, he is accustomed to express himself in the\nlanguage of ridiculous triumph, without any sufficient cause. But he\nquotes one passage more, which he asserts to be conclusive beyond all the\nrest; that is, the prophecy of Adam, who, when he saw his wife, said,\n“This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh.”(1137) But how does\nhe prove this to be a prophecy? Because Christ, according to Matthew,\nattributes the same language to God; as though every thing that God has\nspoken by men contained some prophecy! Then Osiander may seek for\nprophecies in each of the precepts of the law, of which it is evident God\nwas the author. Besides, Christ would have been a low and grovelling\nexpositor, if he had confined himself to the literal sense. Because he is\ntreating, not of the mystical union, with which he has honoured his\nChurch, but only of conjugal fidelity; he informs us, that God had\npronounced a husband and wife to be one flesh, that no one might attempt\nby a divorce to violate that indissoluble bond. If Osiander be displeased\nwith this simplicity, let him censure Christ, because he did not conduct\nhis disciples to a mystery, by a more subtile interpretation of the\nlanguage of the Father. Nor does his delirious imagination obtain any\nsupport from Paul, who, after having said that “we are members of Christ’s\nflesh,” immediately adds, “this is a great mystery.”(1138) For the\napostle’s design was, not to explain the sense in which Adam spoke, but,\nunder the figure and similitude of marriage, to display the sacred union\nwhich makes us one with Christ. And this is implied in his very words; for\nwhen he apprizes us that he is speaking of Christ and the Church, he\nintroduces a kind of correction to distinguish between the law of marriage\nand the spiritual union of Christ and the Church. Wherefore this futile\nnotion appears destitute of any solid foundation. Nor do I think there\nwill be any necessity for me to discuss similar subtilties; since the\nvanity of them all will be discovered from the foregoing very brief\nrefutation. But this sober declaration will be amply sufficient for the\nsolid satisfaction of the children of God; that “when the fulness of the\ntime was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the\nlaw, to redeem them that were under the law.”(1139)"

          "title": "Chapter XIII. Christ’s Assumption Of Real Humanity.",
          "content": "The arguments for the Divinity of Christ, which has already been proved by\nclear and irrefragable testimonies, it would, I conceive, be unnecessary\nto reiterate. It remains, then, for us to examine, how, after having been\ninvested with our flesh, he has performed the office of a Mediator. Now,\nthe reality of his humanity was anciently opposed by the Manichæans and by\nthe Marcionites. Of whom the latter imagined to themselves a visionary\nphantom instead of the body of Christ; and the former dreamed that he had\na celestial body. But both these notions are contrary to numerous and\npowerful testimonies of Scripture. For the blessing is promised, neither\nin a heavenly seed, nor in a phantom of a man, but in the seed of Abraham\nand Jacob; nor is the eternal throne promised to an aërial man, but to the\nSon of David and the fruit of his loins.(1140) Wherefore, on his\nmanifestation in the flesh, he is called the Son of David and of Abraham,\nnot because he was merely born of the virgin after having been formed of\nsome aërial substance; but because, according to Paul, he was “made of the\nseed of David according to the flesh;” as the same apostle in another\nplace informs us, that “according to the flesh” he descended from the\nJews.(1141) Wherefore the Lord himself, not content with the appellation\nof _man_, frequently calls himself also _the Son of Man_—a term which he\nintended as a more express declaration of his real humanity. As the Holy\nSpirit has on so many occasions, by so many instruments, and with such\ngreat diligence and simplicity, declared a fact by no means abstruse in\nitself, who could have supposed that any mortals would have such\nconsummate impudence as to dare to obscure it with subtilties? But more\ntestimonies offer themselves, if we wished to multiply them; such as this\nof Paul, that “God sent forth his Son made of a woman;”(1142) and\ninnumerable others, from which he appears to have been liable to hunger,\nthirst, cold, and other infirmities of our nature. But from the multitude\nwe must chiefly select those, which may conduce to the edification of our\nminds in true faith; as when it is said, that “he took not on him the\nnature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham;” that he took\nflesh and blood, “that through death he might destroy him that had the\npower of death;” for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren;\nthat “in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that\nhe might be a merciful and faithful high priest;” that “we have not a high\npriest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;”(1143)\nand the like. To the same purpose is what we have just before mentioned,\nthat it was necessary for the sins of the world to be expiated in our\nflesh; which is clearly asserted by Paul.(1144) And certainly all that the\nFather has conferred on Christ, belongs to us, because he “is the head,\nfrom whom the whole body is fitly joined together, and compacted by that\nwhich every joint supplieth.”(1145) There will otherwise be no propriety\nin the declaration, “that God giveth the Spirit not by measure unto him,\nthat we may all receive of his fulness;”(1146) since nothing would be more\nabsurd, than that God should be enriched in his essence by any\nadventitious gift. For this reason also Christ himself says in another\nplace, “For their sakes I sanctify myself.”(1147)\nII. The passages which they adduce in confirmation of this error, they\nmost foolishly pervert; nor do their frivolous subtilties at all avail\nthem in their endeavours to obviate the arguments which I have advanced in\ndefence of our sentiments. Marcion imagines that Christ invested himself\nwith a phantom instead of a real body; because he is said to have been\n“made in the likeness of men,” and to have been “found in fashion as a\nman.”(1148) But in drawing this conclusion, he totally overlooks the scope\nof Paul in that passage. For his design is, not to describe the nature of\nthe body which Christ assumed, but to assert that whilst he might have\ndisplayed his Divinity, he manifested himself in the condition of an\nabject and despised man. For, to exhort us to humility by the example of\nChrist, he shows, that being God, he might have instantaneously made a\nconspicuous exhibition of his glory to the world; yet that he receded from\nhis right, and voluntarily debased himself, for that he assumed the form\nof a servant, and content with that humble station, suffered his Divinity\nto be hidden behind the veil of humanity. The subject of this statement,\nwithout doubt, is not the nature of Christ, but his conduct. From the\nwhole context also it is easy to infer, that Christ humbled himself by the\nassumption of a real human nature. For what is the meaning of this clause,\n“that he was found in fashion as a man,” but that for a time his Divine\nglory was invisible, and nothing appeared but the human form, in a mean\nand abject condition? For otherwise there would be no foundation for this\nassertion of Peter, that he was “put to death in the flesh, but quickened\nby the Spirit,”(1149) if the Son of God had not been subject to the\ninfirmities of human nature. This is more plainly expressed by Paul, when\nhe says, that “he was crucified through weakness.”(1150) The same is\nconfirmed by his exaltation, because he is positively asserted to have\nobtained a new glory after his humiliation; which could only be applicable\nto a real man composed of body and soul. Manichæus fabricates for Christ\nan aërial body; because he is called “the second Adam, the Lord from\nheaven.”(1151) But the apostle in that place is not speaking of a\ncelestial corporeal essence, but of a spiritual energy, which, being\ndiffused from Christ, raises us into life. That energy we have already\nseen that Peter and Paul distinguish from his body. The orthodox doctrine,\ntherefore, concerning the body of Christ, is firmly established by this\nvery passage. For unless Christ had the same corporeal nature with us,\nthere would be no force in the argument which Paul so vehemently urges,\nthat if Christ be risen from the dead, then we also shall rise; that if we\nrise not, neither is Christ risen.(1152) Of whatever cavils either the\nancient Manichæans, or their modern disciples, endeavour to avail\nthemselves, they cannot succeed. Their nugatory pretence that Christ is\ncalled “the Son of man,” because he was promised to men, is a vain\nsubterfuge; for it is evident that in the Hebrew idiom, _the Son of man_\nis a phrase expressive of a real man. And Christ undoubtedly retained the\nphraseology of his own language. There is no room for disputing what is\nmeant by _the sons of Adam_. And not to go any further, it will be fully\nsufficient to quote a passage in the eighth psalm which the apostles apply\nto Christ: “What is man, that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man,\nthat thou visitest him?” This phrase expresses the true humanity of\nChrist; because, though he was not immediately begotten by a mortal\nfather, yet his descent was derived from Adam. Nor would there otherwise\nbe any truth in what we have just quoted, that Christ became a partaker of\nflesh and blood, that he might bring many sons to glory—language which\nclearly styles him to be a partaker of the same common nature with us. In\nthe same sense the apostle says, that “both he that sanctifieth and they\nwho are sanctified are all of one.” For the context proves that this\nrefers to a community of nature; because he immediately adds, “for which\ncause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.”(1153) For if he had\nalready said that the faithful are of God, what reason could Jesus Christ\nhave to be ashamed of such great dignity? But because Christ, of his\ninfinite grace, associates himself with those who are vile and\ncontemptible, it is therefore said that he is not ashamed. It is a vain\nobjection which they make, that on this principle the impious will become\nthe brethren of Christ; because we know that the children of God are born,\nnot of flesh and blood, but of the Spirit through faith; therefore a\ncommunity of nature alone is not sufficient to constitute a fraternal\nunion. But though it is only to the faithful that the apostle assigns the\nhonour of being one with Christ, yet it does not follow that unbelievers\nare not, according to the flesh, born of the same original; as, when we\nsay that Christ was made man, to make us children of God, this expression\nextends not to all men; because faith is the medium by which we are\nspiritually ingrafted into the body of Christ. They likewise raise a\nfoolish contention respecting the appellation of _first‐born_. They plead\nthat Christ ought to have been born at the beginning, immediately of Adam,\nin order “that he might be the first‐born among many brethren.”(1154) But\nthe primogeniture attributed to him refers not to age, but to the degree\nof honour and the eminence of power which he enjoys. Nor is there any more\nplausibility in their notion, that Christ is said to have assumed the\nnature of man, and not of angels, because he received the human race into\nhis favour. For the apostle, to magnify the honour with which Christ has\nfavoured us, compares us with the angels, before whom in this respect we\nare preferred.(1155) And if the testimony of Moses be duly considered,\nwhere he says that the Seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the\nserpent,(1156) it will decide the whole controversy. For that prediction\nrelates not to Christ alone, but to the whole human race. Because the\nvictory was to be gained for us by Christ, God pronounces, in general,\nthat the posterity of the woman should be superior to the devil. Whence it\nfollows, that Christ descended from the human race; because the design of\nGod, in that promise to Eve, was to comfort her with a good hope, that she\nmight not be overcome with sorrow.\nIII. Those passages, where Christ is called “the seed of Abraham,” and\n“the fruit of the body of David,” they with equal folly and wickedness\ninvolve in allegories. For if the word _seed_ had been used in an\nallegorical sense, Paul certainly would not have been silent respecting\nit, where, without any figure, he explicitly affirms, that there are not\nmany sons of Abraham who are Redeemers, but Christ alone.(1157) Equally\nunfounded is their notion, that Christ is called the Son of David in no\nother sense, but because he had been promised, and was at length\nmanifested in due time. For after Paul has declared him to have been “made\nof the seed of David,” the immediate addition of this phrase, “according\nto the flesh,”(1158) is certainly a designation of nature. Thus also in\nanother place he calls him “God blessed for ever,” and distinctly states\nthat he descended from the Jews “as concerning the flesh.”(1159) Now, if\nhe was not really begotten of the seed of David, what is the meaning of\nthis expression, “the fruit of his loins?”(1160) What becomes of this\npromise, “Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne?”(1161) They\nlikewise trifle in a sophistical manner with the genealogy of Christ, as\nit is given by Matthew. For though he mentions the parents of Joseph, and\nnot of Mary, yet as he was treating of a thing then generally known, he\nthought it sufficient to show that Joseph descended from the seed of\nDavid, while there could be no doubt that Mary was of the same family. But\nLuke goes further, with a view to signify, that the salvation procured by\nChrist is common to all mankind; since Christ, the author of salvation, is\ndescended from Adam, the common parent of all. I grant, indeed, that from\nthe genealogy it cannot be inferred that Christ is the Son of David, any\notherwise than as he was born of the Virgin. But the modern Marcionites,\nto give a plausibility to their error, that Christ derived his body from\nnothing, contend that women have no generative semen; and thus they\nsubvert the elements of nature. But as this is not a theological question,\nand the arguments which they adduce are so futile that there will be no\ndifficulty in repelling them, I shall not meddle with points belonging to\nphilosophy and the medical art. It will be sufficient for me to obviate\nthe objection which they allege from the Scripture, namely, that Aaron and\nJehoiada married wives of the tribe of Judah; and thus, if women contain\ngenerative semen, the distinction of tribes was confounded. But it is\nsufficiently known, that, for the purposes of political regulation, the\nposterity is always reckoned from the father; yet that the superiority of\nthe male sex forms no objection to the coöperation of the female semen in\nthe process of generation. This solution extends to all the genealogies.\nFrequently, when the Scripture exhibits a catalogue of names, it mentions\nnone but men; is it therefore to be concluded that women are nothing? Even\nchildren themselves know that women are comprehended under their husbands.\nFor this reason women are said to bear children to their husbands, because\nthe name of the family always remains with the males. Now, as it is a\nprivilege conceded to the superiority of the male sex, that children\nshould be accounted noble or ignoble, according to the condition of their\nfathers, so, on the other hand, it is held by the lawyers, that in a state\nof slavery the offspring follows the condition of the mother. Whence we\nmay infer, that the offspring is produced partly from the seed of the\nmother; and the common language of all nations implies that mothers have\nsome share in the generation of children. This is in harmony with the\nDivine law, which otherwise would have no ground for the prohibition of\nthe marriage of an uncle with his sister’s daughter; because in that case\nthere would be no consanguinity. It would also be lawful for a man to\nmarry his uterine sister, provided she were begotten by another father.\nBut while I grant that a passive power is ascribed to women, I also\nmaintain that the same that is affirmed of men is indiscriminately\npredicated of them. Nor is Christ himself said to be “made” by a woman,\nbut “of a woman.”(1162) Some of these persons, casting off all modesty,\nimpudently inquire, whether we choose to say that Christ was procreated\nfrom the menstrual seed of the Virgin. I will inquire, on the other hand,\nwhether he was not united with the blood of his mother; and this they must\nbe constrained to confess. It is properly inferred, therefore, from the\nlanguage of Matthew, that inasmuch as Christ was begotten of Mary,(1163)\nhe was procreated from her seed; as when Booz is said to have been\nbegotten of Rahab,(1164) it denotes a similar generation. Nor is it the\ndesign of Matthew here to describe the Virgin as a tube through which\nChrist passed, but to discriminate this miraculous conception from\nordinary generation, in that Jesus Christ was generated of the seed of\nDavid by means of a Virgin. In the same sense, and for the same reason\nthat Isaac is said to have been begotten of Abraham, Solomon of David, and\nJoseph of Jacob, so Christ is said to have been begotten of his mother.\nFor the evangelist has written the whole of his account upon this\nprinciple; and to prove that Christ descended from David, he has contented\nhimself with this one fact, that he was begotten of Mary. Whence it\nfollows, that he took for granted the consanguinity of Mary and Joseph.\nIV. The absurdities, with which these opponents wish to press us, are\nreplete with puerile cavils. They esteem it mean and dishonourable to\nChrist, that he should derive his descent from men; because he could not\nbe exempt from the universal law, which concludes all the posterity of\nAdam, without exception, under sin.(1165) But the antithesis, which we\nfind in Paul, easily solves this difficulty: “As by one man sin entered\ninto the world, and death by sin, even so by the righteousness of one, the\ngrace of God hath abounded.”(1166) To this the following passage\ncorresponds: “The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the\nLord from heaven.”(1167) Therefore the same apostle, in another place, by\nteaching us that Christ was “sent in the likeness of sinful flesh”(1168)\nto satisfy the law, expressly distinguishes him from the common condition\nof mankind; so that he is a real man, and yet free from all fault and\ncorruption. They betray their ignorance in arguing that, if Christ is\nperfectly immaculate, and was begotten of the seed of Mary, by the secret\noperation of the Spirit, then it follows that there is no impurity in the\nseed of women, but only in that of men. For we do not represent Christ as\nperfectly immaculate, merely because he was born of the seed of a woman\nunconnected with any man, but because he was sanctified by the Spirit, so\nthat his generation was pure and holy, such as it would have been before\nthe fall of Adam. And it is a fixed maxim with us, that whenever the\nScripture mentions the purity of Christ, it relates to a real humanity;\nbecause to assert the purity of Deity would be quite unnecessary. The\nsanctification, also, of which he speaks in the seventeenth chapter of\nJohn,(1169) could have no reference to the Divine nature. Nor do we, as\nthey pretend, imagine two kinds of seed in Adam, notwithstanding Christ\nwas free from all contagion. For the generation of man is not naturally\nand originally impure and corrupt, but only accidentally so, in\nconsequence of the fall. Therefore we need not wonder, that Christ, who\nwas to restore our integrity, was exempted from the general corruption.\nBut what they urge on us as an absurdity, that if the Word of God was\nclothed with flesh, it was therefore confined within the narrow prison of\nan earthly body, is mere impudence; because, although the infinite essence\nof the Word is united in one person with the nature of man, yet we have no\nidea of its incarceration or confinement. For the Son of God miraculously\ndescended from heaven, yet in such a manner that he never left heaven; he\nchose to be miraculously conceived in the womb of the Virgin, to live on\nthe earth, and to be suspended on the cross; and yet he never ceased to\nfill the universe, in the same manner as from the beginning."

          "content": "Mediator.\nWhen it is said that “the Word was made flesh,”(1170) this is not to be\nunderstood as if the Word was transmuted into flesh, or blended with\nflesh. Choosing from the womb of the Virgin a temple for his residence, he\nwho was the Son of God, became also the Son of man, not by a confusion of\nsubstance, but by a unity of person. For we assert such a connection and\nunion of the Divinity with the humanity, that each nature retains its\nproperties entire, and yet both together constitute one Christ. If any\nthing among men can be found to resemble so great a mystery, man himself\nappears to furnish the most apposite similitude; being evidently composed\nof two substances, of which, however, neither is so confounded with the\nother, as not to retain its distinct nature. For the soul is not the body,\nnor is the body the soul. Wherefore that is predicated separately of the\nsoul, which cannot be at all applied to the body. On the contrary, that is\npredicated of the body, which is totally incompatible with the soul. And\nthat is predicated of the whole man, which cannot with propriety be\nunderstood either of the soul or of the body alone. Lastly, the properties\nof the soul are transferred to the body, and the properties of the body to\nthe soul; yet he that is composed of these two parts is no more than one\nman. Such forms of expression signify that there is in man one person\ncomposed of two distinct parts; and that there are two different natures\nunited in him to constitute that one person. The Scriptures speak in a\nsimilar manner respecting Christ. They attribute to him, sometimes those\nthings which are applicable merely to his humanity; sometimes those things\nwhich belong peculiarly to his Divinity; and not unfrequently those things\nwhich comprehend both his natures, but are incompatible with either of\nthem alone. And this union of the two natures in Christ they so carefully\nmaintain, that they sometimes attribute to one what belongs to the other—a\nmode of expression which the ancient writers called a communication of\nproperties.\nII. These things might be liable to objection, if the Scripture did not\nabound with passages, which prove that none of them is of human invention.\nWhat Christ asserted concerning himself, “Before Abraham was, I am,”(1171)\nwas very inapplicable to his humanity. I am aware of the cavil with which\nerroneous spirits would corrupt this passage,—that he was before all ages,\nbecause he was even then foreknown as the Redeemer, as well in the decree\nof the Father, as in the minds of the faithful. But as he clearly\ndistinguishes the day of his manifestation from his eternal essence, and\nprofessedly urges his antiquity, in proof of his possessing an authority\nin which he excels Abraham, there is no doubt that he challenges to\nhimself what is peculiar to the Deity. Paul asserts him to be “the first‐\nborn of every creature, that he is before all things, and that by him all\nthings consist:”(1172) he declares himself, that he “had a glory with the\nFather before the world was,”(1173) and that he coöperates with the\nFather.(1174) These things are equally incompatible with humanity. It is\ncertain that these, and such as these, are peculiar attributes of\nDivinity. But when he is called the “servant” of the Father;(1175) when it\nis stated that he “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God\nand man;”(1176) that he seeks not his own glory; that he knows not the\nlast day; that he speaks not of himself; that he does not his own will;\nthat he was seen and handled;(1177) all this belongs solely to his\nhumanity. For as he is God, he is incapable of any augmentation whatever;\nhe does all things for his own glory, and there is nothing concealed from\nhim; he does all things according to the decision of his own will, and is\ninvisible and intangible. And yet he ascribes these things not to his\nhuman nature separately, but to himself, as though they belonged to the\nperson of the Mediator. But the communication of properties is exemplified\nin the assertion of Paul that “God purchased the Church with his own\nblood,”(1178) and that “the Lord of glory” was “crucified.”(1179) Also in\nwhat John says, that they had “handled the Word of life.”(1180) God has no\nblood; he is not capable of suffering, or of being touched with hands; but\nsince he, who was at once the true God and the man Christ Jesus, was\ncrucified and shed his blood for us, those things which were performed in\nhis human nature are improperly, yet not without reason, transferred to\nthe Divinity. There is a similar example of this, where John teaches us,\nthat “God laid down his life for us.”(1181) There also the property of the\nhumanity is transferred to the other nature. Again, when Christ, while he\nstill lived on the earth, said, “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he\nthat came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven:”(1182)\nas man, and in the body which he had assumed, he certainly was not at that\ntime in heaven, but because he was both God and man, on account of the\nunion of both natures, he attributed to one what belonged to the other.\nIII. But the clearest of all the passages declarative of the true\nsubstance of Christ are those which comprehend both the natures together;\nsuch as abound in the Gospel of John. For it is not with exclusive\nreference to the Deity or the humanity, but respecting the complex person\ncomposed of both, that we find it there stated; that he has received of\nthe Father power to forgive sins, to raise up whom he will, to bestow\nrighteousness, holiness, and salvation; that he is appointed to be the\nJudge of the living and the dead, that he may receive the same honour as\nthe Father;(1183) finally, that he is “the light of the world,” “the good\nshepherd,” “the only door,” “the true vine.”(1184) For with such\nprerogatives was the Son of God invested at his manifestation in the\nflesh; which although he enjoyed with the Father before the creation of\nthe world, yet not in the same manner or on the same account; and which\ncould not be conferred on a mere man. In the same sense also it is\nreasonable to understand the declaration of Paul, that after the last\njudgment Christ “shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the\nFather.”(1185) Now, the kingdom of the Son of God, which had no beginning,\nwill never have any end. But as he concealed himself under the meanness of\nthe flesh, and humbled himself by assuming the form of a servant, and laid\naside his external majesty in obedience to the Father,(1186) and after\nhaving undergone this humiliation, was at length crowned with glory and\nhonour, and exalted to supreme dominion,(1187) that before him “every knee\nshould bow;”(1188) so he shall then surrender to the Father that name and\ncrown of glory, and all that he has received from the Father, “that God\nmay be all in all.”(1189) For why has power and dominion been given to\nhim, but that the Father may rule us by his hand? In this sense he is also\nsaid to sit at the right hand of the Father. But this is only temporary,\ntill we can enjoy the immediate contemplation of the Deity. And here it is\nimpossible to excuse the error of the ancients, who, for want of\nsufficient attention to the person of the Mediator, obscure the genuine\nsense of almost all the doctrine which we have in the Gospel of John, and\ninvolve themselves in many difficulties. Let this maxim, then, serve us as\na key to the true sense, that those things which relate to the office of\nthe Mediator, are not spoken simply of his Divine or of his human nature.\nChrist therefore will reign, till he comes to judge the world, forasmuch\nas he connects us with the Father as far as is compatible with our\ninfirmity. But when we shall participate the glory of heaven, and see God\nas he is, then, having fulfilled the office of Mediator, he will cease to\nbe the ambassador of the Father, and will be content with that glory which\nhe enjoyed before the creation of the world. Nor is the title of Lord\npeculiarly applied to the person of Christ in any other respect, than as\nit marks an intermediate station between God and us. This is the meaning\nof that expression of Paul, “One God, of whom are all things; and one\nLord, by whom are all things;”(1190) namely, to whom the Father has\ncommitted a temporary dominion, till we shall be admitted to the immediate\npresence of his Divine majesty; which will be so far from sustaining any\ndiminution by his surrender of the kingdom to the Father, that it will\nexhibit itself in far superior splendour. For then also God will cease to\nbe the head of Christ, because the Deity of Christ himself, which is still\ncovered with a veil, will shine forth in all its native effulgence.\nIV. And this observation, if the reader make a judicious application of\nit, will be of great use towards the solution of many difficulties. For it\nis surprising how much ignorant persons, and even some who are not\naltogether destitute of learning, are perplexed by such forms of\nexpression, as they find attributed to Christ, which are not exactly\nappropriate either to his Divinity or to his humanity. This is for want of\nconsidering that they are applicable to his complex person, consisting of\nGod and man, and to his office of Mediator. And indeed we may see the most\nbeautiful coherence between all these things, if they have only a sober\nexpositor, to examine such great mysteries with becoming reverence. But\nthese furious and frantic spirits throw every thing into confusion. They\nlay hold of the properties of his humanity, to destroy his Divinity; on\nthe other hand, they catch at the attributes of his Divinity, to destroy\nhis humanity; and by what is spoken of both natures united, but is\napplicable separately to neither, they attempt to destroy both. Now, what\nis this but to contend that Christ is not man, because he is God; that he\nis not God, because he is man; and that he is neither man nor God, because\nhe is at once both man and God? We conclude, therefore, that Christ, as he\nis God and man, composed of these two natures united, yet not confounded,\nis our Lord and the true Son of God, even in his humanity; though not on\naccount of his humanity. For we ought carefully to avoid the error of\nNestorius, who, attempting rather to divide than to distinguish the two\nnatures, thereby imagined a double Christ. This we find clearly\ncontradicted by the Scripture, where the appellation of “the Son of God”\nis given to him who was born of the Virgin, and the Virgin herself is\ncalled “the mother of our Lord.”(1191) We must also beware of the error of\nEutyches, lest while we aim to establish the unity of Christ’s person, we\ndestroy the distinction of his two natures. For we have already cited so\nmany testimonies, where his Divinity is distinguished from his humanity,\nand the Scripture abounds with so many others, that they may silence even\nthe most contentious. I shall shortly subjoin some, in order to a more\ncomplete refutation of that notion. At present one passage shall suffice\nus; for Christ would not have styled his body “a temple,”(1192) if it had\nnot been the residence of the Divinity, and at the same time distinct from\nit. Wherefore, as Nestorius was justly condemned in the council of\nEphesus, so also was Eutyches afterwards in the councils of Constantinople\nand Chalcedon; for to confound the two natures in Christ, and to separate\nthem, are equally wrong.\nV. But in our time also there has arisen a heretic equally pestilent,\nMichael Servetus, who in the place of the Son of God has substituted an\nimaginary being composed of the essence of God, spirit, flesh, and three\nuncreated elements. In the first place, he denies Christ to be the Son of\nGod, in any other respect than as he was begotten by the Holy Spirit in\nthe womb of the Virgin. But his subtlety tends to subvert the distinction\nof the two natures, and thereby to represent Christ as something composed\nof God and man, and yet neither God nor man. For this is the principal\npoint which he constantly endeavours to establish, that before Christ was\nmanifested in the flesh, there were in God only some shadowy figures; the\ntruth or effect of which had no real existence till the Word, who had been\ndestined to this honour, actually began to be the Son of God. Now, we\nconfess that the Mediator, who was born of the Virgin, is properly the Son\nof God. Nor indeed could the man Christ be a mirror of the inestimable\ngrace of God, if this dignity had not been conferred on him, to be, and to\nbe called, “the only begotten Son of God.” The doctrine of the Church,\nhowever, remains unshaken, that he is accounted the Son of God, because,\nbeing the Word begotten by the Father before all ages, he assumed the\nhuman nature in a hypostatical union. By the “hypostatical union” the\nancients expressed the combination of two natures constituting one person.\nIt was invented to refute the error of Nestorius, who imagined the Son of\nGod to have dwelt in flesh in such a manner as, notwithstanding that, to\nhave had no real humanity. Servetus falsely accuses us of making two Sons\nof God, when we say that the eternal Word was the Son of God, before he\nwas clothed with flesh; as though we affirmed any other than that he was\nmanifested in the flesh. For if he was God before he became man, it is not\nto be inferred that he began to be a new God. There is no more absurdity\nin affirming that the Son of God appeared in the flesh, who nevertheless\nwas always the Son of God by eternal generation. This is implied in the\nwords of the angel to Mary: “That holy thing which shall be born of thee\nshall be called the Son of God;”(1193) as though he had said, that the\nname of the Son, which had been in obscurity under the law, was about to\nbe celebrated and universally known. Consistent with this is the\nrepresentation of Paul; that through Christ we are the sons of God, and\nmay freely and confidently cry, Abba, Father.(1194) But were not the holy\npatriarchs in ancient times numbered among the children of God? Yes; and\ndepending on this claim, they invoked God as their Father. But because,\nsince the introduction of the only begotten Son of God into the world, the\ncelestial paternity has been more clearly revealed, Paul mentions this as\nthe privilege of the kingdom of Christ. It must, however, be steadily\nmaintained, that God never was a Father, either to angels or to men, but\nwith reference to his only begotten Son; and especially that men, whom\ntheir own iniquity renders odious to God, are his sons by gratuitous\nadoption, because Christ is his Son by nature. Nor is there any force in\nthe cavil of Servetus, that this depends on the filiation which God has\ndecreed in himself; because we are not here treating of figures, as\nexpiation was represented by the blood of the sacrifices: but as they\ncould not be the sons of God in reality, unless their adoption were\nfounded on this head, it is unreasonable to detract from the head, that\nwhich is common to all the members. I go further: since the Scripture\ncalls angels “the children of God,”(1195) whose enjoyment of such high\ndignity depended not on the future redemption, yet it is necessary that\nChrist should precede them in order, seeing it is by him that they are\nconnected with the Father. I will briefly repeat this observation, and\napply the same to the human race. Since angels and men were originally\ncreated in such a condition, that God was the common Father of both, if\nthere be any truth in the assertion of Paul, “that Christ was before all\nthings, the head of the body, and the first‐born of every creature, that\nin all things he might have the preëminence,”(1196) I conceive I am right\nin concluding, that he was also the Son of God before the creation of the\nworld.\nVI. But if his filiation (so to speak) commenced at the time of his\nmanifestation in the flesh, it will follow that he was the Son also in\nrespect of his human nature. Servetus and other heretics maintain that\nChrist, who appeared in the flesh, was the Son of God; because out of the\nflesh he could not be entitled to this appellation. Now, let them answer\nme, whether he be the Son according to both natures, and in respect of\nboth. So indeed they idly pretend; but Paul teaches us very differently.\nWe confess that Christ is called “the Son” in his human nature, not as the\nfaithful are, merely by adoption and grace, but the true and natural, and\ntherefore the only Son; that by this character he may be distinguished\nfrom all others. For we, who are regenerated to a new life, are honoured\nby God with the title of sons; but the appellation of “his true and only\nbegotten Son” he gives to Christ alone. But among such a multitude of\nbrethren, how can he be the only Son, unless he possess by nature what we\nhave received as a gift? And we extend this honour to the whole person of\nthe Mediator, that he who was born of the Virgin, and offered himself on\nthe cross as a victim to the Father, is truly and properly the Son of God;\nbut nevertheless with respect to his Deity, as Paul suggests, when he says\nthat he was “separated unto the gospel of God, which he had promised\nafore, concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the\nseed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God\nwith power.”(1197) When he distinctly denominates him the Son of David\naccording to the flesh, why should he particularly say that he was\ndeclared to be the Son of God with power, unless he intended to suggest\nthat this dignity depended not on that flesh, but on something else? For\nin the same sense in which he says in another place that “he was crucified\nthrough weakness, yet that he liveth by the power of God,” so in this\npassage he introduces the difference between the two natures. They\ncertainly must be constrained to admit, that as he has received of his\nmother that which causes him to be called the Son of David, so he has from\nhis Father that which constitutes him the Son of God, and that this is\nsomething distinct and different from his humanity. The Scripture\ndistinguishes him by two names, calling him sometimes “the Son of God,”\nsometimes “the Son of man.” With respect to the latter, it cannot be\ndisputed that he is styled the “Son of man,” in conformity to the common\nidiom of the Hebrew language, because he is one of the posterity of Adam.\nI contend, on the other hand, that he is denominated “the Son of God” on\naccount of his Deity and eternal existence; because it is equally\nreasonable that the appellation of “Son of God” should be referred to the\nDivine nature, as that that of “Son of man” should be referred to the\nhuman nature. In short, in the passage which I have cited, “that he, who\nwas made of the seed of David according to the flesh, was declared to be\nthe Son of God with power,” Paul intends the same as he teaches us in\nanother place, that “Christ, who as concerning the flesh came of the Jews,\nis God blessed for ever.” But if the distinction of the two natures be\nexpressed in both these passages, by what authority will they deny that he\nis the Son of God in respect of his Divine nature, who according to the\nflesh is likewise the Son of man?\nVII. They clamorously urge in support of their error that God is said “not\nto have spared his own Son,”(1198) and that the angel directed that the\nvery same who was to be born of the Virgin, should be called “the Son of\nthe Highest.”(1199) But to prevent their glorying in so futile an\nobjection, let them accompany us in a brief examination of the validity of\ntheir reasoning. For if it be rightly concluded, that he began to be the\nSon of God at his conception, because he that is conceived is called his\nSon, it will follow that he began to be the Word at his manifestation in\nthe flesh, because John tells us that “he declares that, which his hands\nhave handled, of the Word of life.”(1200) So when they read the following\naddress of the prophet, “Thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little\namong the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me\nthat is to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old,\nfrom everlasting, or from the days of eternity,”(1201) what interpretation\nwill they be obliged to adopt, if they determine to pursue such a mode of\nargumentation? For I have declared that we by no means coincide with\nNestorius, who imagined two Christs. According to our doctrine, Christ has\nmade us the sons of God, together with himself, by the privilege of a\nfraternal union, because he is, in our nature which he assumed, the only\nbegotten Son of God. And Augustine judiciously apprizes us, “that it is an\nillustrious mirror of the wonderful and singular grace of God, that Jesus\nChrist, considered as man, obtained honour which he could not merit.” From\nhis very birth, therefore, was Christ adorned, even in his human nature,\nwith the dignity of being the Son of God. Yet in the unity of person we\nmust not imagine such a confusion, as to destroy that which is peculiar to\nDeity. For it is no more unreasonable, that the eternal Word of God and\nthe man Christ Jesus, the two natures being united into one person, should\nbe called the Son of God in different senses, than that he should be\nstyled, in various respects, sometimes the Son of God, sometimes the Son\nof man. Nor are we any more embarrassed with the other cavil of Servetus,\nthat before Christ appeared in the flesh, he is no where called the Son of\nGod, but in a figurative sense. For though the description of him then was\nrather obscure, yet since it has now been clearly proved, that he was the\neternal God no otherwise than as he was the Word begotten of the eternal\nFather, and that this name is applicable to him in the character of\nMediator which he has assumed, only because he is God manifested in the\nflesh; and that God the Father would not have been thus denominated from\nthe beginning, unless there had even then been a mutual relation to the\nSon, who is the source of all kindred or paternity in heaven and in\nearth;(1202) the inference is clear, that even under the law and the\nprophets he was the Son of God, before this name was commonly used in the\nChurch. If the contention be merely about the word, Solomon, in speaking\nof the infinite sublimity of God, affirms his Son to be incomprehensible\nas well as himself: “What is his name,” says he, “and what is his Son’s\nname, if thou canst tell?”(1203) I am aware that this testimony will not\nhave sufficient weight with contentious persons, nor indeed do I lay much\nstress on it, only that it fixes the charge of a malicious cavil on those\nwho deny that Christ is the Son of God, any otherwise than because he has\nbecome man. It must also be remarked that all the most ancient writers\nhave with one accord so unequivocally asserted the same doctrine, that it\nargues impudence equally ridiculous and detestable in those who dare to\nrepresent us as opposing Irenæus and Tertullian, who both acknowledge that\nJesus Christ, who at length made a visible appearance, was always the\ninvisible Son of God.\nVIII. But although Servetus has accumulated many horrible and monstrous\nnotions, to which some of his brethren, perhaps, would refuse to\nsubscribe, yet, whoever they are that acknowledge not Christ to be the Son\nof God, except in the human nature, if we press them closely, we shall\nfind that this title is admitted by them on no other ground than because\nhe was conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin; as the\nManichæans formerly pretended that man received his soul by emanation from\nGod, because it is said that God breathed into Adam the breath of\nlife.(1204) For they lay such stress on the name of Son, that they leave\nno difference between the two natures, but tell us, in a confused manner,\nthat Christ is the Son of God, considered as man, because his human nature\nwas begotten by God. Thus the eternal generation of Wisdom, of which\nSolomon speaks,(1205) is destroyed, and no notice is taken of the Deity in\nthe Mediator, or a phantom is substituted instead of his humanity. It\nmight indeed be useful to refute the grosser fallacies of Servetus, with\nwhich he has fascinated himself and others, that the pious reader,\nadmonished by this example, may preserve himself within the bounds of\nsobriety and modesty; yet I conceive this will be unnecessary here, as I\nhave already done it in a separate treatise. The substance of them all is,\nthat the Son of God was from the beginning an ideal existence, and that\neven then he was predestinated to be a man who was to be the essential\nimage of God. Nor does he acknowledge any other word of God than what\nconsists in an external splendour. His generation he explains thus: that\nthere existed in God from the beginning a will to beget a Son, which was\ncarried into effect by his actual formation. He likewise confounds the\nSpirit with the Word, by asserting that God distributed the invisible Word\nand Spirit into body and soul. In short, he puts the prefiguration of\nChrist in the place of his generation; and affirms that he who was then in\nexternal appearance a shadowy Son, was at length begotten by the Word, to\nwhich he attributes the properties of seed. Whence it will follow, that\nthe meanest animals are equally the children of God, because they were\ncreated of the original seed of the Word of God. For though he compounds\nChrist of three uncreated elements, to countenance the assertion that he\nis begotten of the essence of God, yet he pretends him to have been the\nfirst‐born among creatures in such a sense, that even inanimate\nsubstances, according to their rank, possess the same essential Divinity.\nAnd that he may not seem to despoil Christ of his Deity, he asserts that\nhis flesh is coëssential with God, and that the Word was made flesh by a\nconversion of the humanity into Deity. Thus, while he cannot conceive\nChrist to be the Son of God, unless his flesh proceeded from the essence\nof God, and were reconverted into Deity, he annihilates the eternal\nhypostasis of the Word, and deprives us of the Son of David, the promised\nRedeemer. He frequently indeed repeats this, that the Son was begotten of\nGod by knowledge and predestination, but that at length he was made man of\nthose materials, which in the beginning appeared with God in the three\nelements, and which afterwards appeared in the first light of the world,\nin the cloud, and in the pillar of fire. Now, how shamefully he\ncontradicts himself, it would be too tedious to relate. From this summary\nthe judicious reader will conclude, that by the subtle fallacies of this\nheretic, the hope of salvation is completely extinguished. For if the body\nwere the Deity itself, it would no longer be the temple of it. Now, we can\nhave no Redeemer, except him who became man, by being really begotten of\nthe seed of Abraham and David according to the flesh. Servetus makes a\nvery improper use of the language of John, that “the word was made flesh;”\nfor while it opposes the error of Nestorius, it is as far from affording\nthe least countenance to this impious notion, which originated with\nEutyches. The sole design of the evangelist was, to assert the union of\nthe two natures in one person."

          "content": "Regal, And Sacerdotal, Necessary To Our Knowing The End Of His Mission\nFrom The Father, And The Benefits Which He Confers On Us.\nIt is a just observation of Augustine, that although heretics profess the\nname of Christ, yet he is not a foundation to them in common with the\npious, but remains exclusively the foundation of the Church; because, on a\ndiligent consideration of what belongs to Christ, Christ will be found\namong them only in name, not in reality. Thus the Papists in the present\nage, although the name of the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, be\nfrequently in their mouths, yet since they are contented with the mere\nname, and despoil him of his power and dignity, these words of Paul, “not\nholding the head,”(1206) are truly applicable to them. Therefore, that\nfaith may find in Christ a solid ground of salvation, and so may rely on\nhim, it is proper for us to establish this principle, that the office\nwhich was assigned to him by the Father consists of three parts. For he\nwas given as a Prophet, a King, and a Priest; though we should derive but\nlittle benefit from an acquaintance with these names, unaccompanied with a\nknowledge of their end and use. For they are likewise pronounced among the\nPapists, but in a frigid and unprofitable manner, while they are ignorant\nof what is included in each of these titles. We have before observed, that\nalthough God sent prophets one after another in a continual succession,\nand never left his people destitute of useful instruction, such as was\nsufficient for salvation, yet the minds of the pious were always\npersuaded, that the full light of understanding was not to be expected\ntill the advent of the Messiah. And that this opinion had even reached the\nSamaritans, notwithstanding they had never been acquainted with the true\nreligion, appears from the speech of the woman: “When Messias is come, he\nwill tell us all things.”(1207) Nor had the Jews entertained this\nsentiment without sufficient ground, but believed as they had been taught\nby infallible oracles. One of the most remarkable is this passage of\nIsaiah: “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader\nand commander to the people;”(1208) just as he had before styled him “the\nWonderful Counsellor.”(1209) In the same manner the apostle, with a view\nto display the perfection of the evangelical doctrine, after having said,\nthat “God at sundry times and in divers manners spake unto the fathers by\nthe prophets,” adds, that he “hath in these last days spoken unto us by\nhis Son.”(1210) But because it was the office of all the prophets to keep\nthe Church in a state of suspense and expectation, and also to support it\ntill the advent of the Mediator, we therefore find the faithful\ncomplaining, in their dispersion, that they were deprived of this ordinary\nblessing: “We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is\nthere among us any that knoweth how long.”(1211) At length, when Christ\nwas at no great distance, a time was prefixed for Daniel to seal up the\nvision and prophecy, not only to authenticate the prediction it contained,\nbut in order that the faithful might patiently bear for a time the want of\nprophets, because the plenitude and conclusion of all revelations was near\nat hand.(1212)\nII. Now, it is to be observed, that the appellation of “Christ” belongs to\nthese three offices. For we know that under the law not only priests and\nkings, but prophets also, were anointed with holy oil. Hence the\ncelebrated title of “Messiah” was given to the promised Mediator. But\nthough I confess that he was called the Messiah with particular reference\nto his kingdom, as I have already shown, yet the prophetical and\nsacerdotal unctions have their respective places, and must not be\nneglected by us. The former is expressly mentioned by Isaiah in these\nwords: “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath\nanointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind\nup the broken‐hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, to proclaim\nthe acceptable year of the Lord.”(1213) We see that he was anointed by the\nSpirit, to be a preacher and witness of the grace of the Father; and that\nnot in a common manner; for he is distinguished from other teachers, who\nheld a similar office. And here again it must be remarked, that he\nreceived this unction, not only for himself, that he might perform the\noffice of a teacher, but for his whole body, that the preaching of the\ngospel might continually be attended with the power of the Spirit. But it\nremains beyond all doubt, that by this perfection of doctrine which he has\nintroduced, he has put an end to all prophecies; so that they who, not\ncontented with the gospel, make any extraneous addition to it, are guilty\nof derogating from his authority. For that voice, which thundered from\nheaven, “This is my beloved Son; hear ye him,”(1214) has exalted him by a\npeculiar privilege above all others. From the head this unction is\nafterwards diffused over the members, according to the prediction of Joel:\n“Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and see visions.”(1215) But\nthe declarations of Paul, that “he is made unto us wisdom,”(1216) and that\n“in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,”(1217) have\nrather a different meaning; namely, that beside him there is nothing\nuseful to be known, and that they who by faith apprehend him as he is,\nhave embraced the whole infinitude of celestial blessings. For which\nreason he writes in another place, “I determined not to know any thing\namong you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified;”(1218) which is perfectly\njust, because it is unlawful to go beyond the simplicity of the gospel.\nAnd the tendency of the prophetic dignity in Christ is, to assure us that\nall the branches of perfect wisdom are included in the system of doctrine\nwhich he has given us.\nIII. I come now to his kingdom, of which it would be useless to speak,\nwithout first apprizing the reader, that it is of a spiritual nature;\nbecause thence we may gather what is its use, and what advantage it\nconfers upon us, and in short all its power and eternity. The eternity,\nwhich the angel in Daniel ascribes to the person of Christ, the angel in\nLuke justly applies to the salvation of the people. But this also is\ntwofold, or is to be considered in two points of view; one extending to\nthe whole body of the Church, the other belonging to every individual\nmember. To the former must be referred the following passage in the\nPsalms: “Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.\nHis seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It\nshall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in\nheaven.”(1219) There is no doubt that God here promises to be the\neverlasting Governor and Defender of his Church, through the medium of his\nSon. For the truth of this prophecy will only be found in Christ; since\nimmediately after the death of Solomon, the dignity of the kingdom\nsustained a considerable degradation, the greater part of it, to the\ndisgrace of the family of David, being transferred to a private man, and\nafterwards was diminished more and more, till at length it fell in a\nmelancholy and total ruin. The same sentiment is conveyed in this\nexclamation of Isaiah: “Who shall declare his generation?”(1220) For when\nhe pronounces that Christ will survive after his death, he connects his\nmembers with him. Therefore, whenever we hear that Christ is armed with\neternal power, let us remember, that this is the bulwark which supports\nthe perpetuity of the Church; that amidst the turbulent agitations with\nwhich it is incessantly harassed, and amidst the painful and formidable\ncommotions which menace it with innumerable calamities, it may still be\npreserved in safety. Thus, when David derides the presumption of the\nenemies who attempt to break the yoke of God and of his Christ, and says,\nthat the kings and the people rage in vain, since he that dwelleth in the\nheavens is sufficiently powerful to repel their violence,—he assures the\nfaithful of the perpetual preservation of the Church, and animates them to\nentertain a cheerful hope, whenever it happens to be oppressed.(1221) So,\nin another place, when, speaking in the name of God, he says, “Sit thou at\nmy right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool,”(1222) he\napprizes us that though numerous and powerful enemies conspire to assault\nthe Church, yet they are not strong enough to prevail against that\nimmutable decree of God, by which he has constituted his Son an eternal\nKing. Whence it follows that it is impossible for the devil, with all the\nassistance of the world, ever to destroy the Church, which is founded on\nthe eternal throne of Christ. Now, with respect to its particular use to\neach individual, this same eternity ought to encourage our hope of a\nblessed immortality; for we see that whatever is terrestrial and worldly\nis temporary and perishable. Therefore, to raise our hope towards heaven,\nChrist declares that his “kingdom is not of this world.”(1223) In a word,\nwhenever we hear that the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, excited by this\ndeclaration, we ought to penetrate to the hope of a better life, and as we\nare now protected by the power of Christ, let us expect the full benefit\nof this grace in the world to come.\nIV. The truth of our observation, that it is impossible to perceive the\nnature and advantages of the kingdom of Christ, unless we know it to be\nspiritual, is sufficiently evident from a consideration of the hardship\nand misery of our condition in the state of warfare under the cross, in\nwhich we have to continue as long as we live. What advantage, then, could\naccrue to us from being collected under the government of the heavenly\nKing, if the benefit of it were not to extend beyond the present state? It\nought therefore to be known, that whatever felicity is promised us in\nChrist, consists not in external accommodations, such as a life of joy and\ntranquillity, abundant wealth, security from every injury, and numerous\ndelights suited to our carnal desires, but that it is peculiar to the\nheavenly state. As in the world the prosperous and desirable state of a\nnation consists partly in domestic peace, and an abundance of all\nblessings, and every good, and partly in strong bulwarks to secure it from\nexternal violence, so Christ enriches his people with every thing\nnecessary to the eternal salvation of their souls, and arms them with\nstrength to enable them to stand invincible against all the assaults of\ntheir spiritual foes. Whence we infer that he reigns rather for us than\nfor himself, and that both internally and externally; that being\nreplenished, as far as God knows to be necessary for us, with the gifts of\nthe Spirit, of which we are naturally destitute, we may perceive from\nthese first‐fruits that we are truly united to God, in order to our\nperfect happiness; and in the next place, that, depending on the power of\nthe same Spirit, we may not doubt of being always victorious over the\ndevil, the world, and every kind of evil. This is implied in the answer of\nChrist to the Pharisees, that as “the kingdom of God is within” us, it\n“cometh not with observation.”(1224) For it is probable, that in\nconsequence of his having professed himself to be that King, under whom\nthe highest blessing of God was to be expected, they ludicrously desired\nhim to display the insignia of his dignity. But to prevent them, who had\notherwise too great a propensity to the world, from directing all their\nattention to external pomp, he commands them to enter into their own\nconsciences, “for the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in\nthe Holy Ghost.”(1225) Here we are briefly taught what advantage results\nto us from the kingdom of Christ. For since it is not terrestrial or\ncarnal, so as to be liable to corruption, but spiritual, it elevates us\neven to eternal life, that we may patiently pass through this life in\nafflictions, hunger, cold, contempt, reproaches, and other disagreeable\ncircumstances; contented with this single assurance, that our King will\nnever desert us, but will assist our necessities, till having completed\nthe term of our warfare, we shall be called to the triumph; for the rule\nof his government is, to communicate to us whatever he has received of the\nFather. Now, since he furnishes and arms us with his power, adorns us with\nhis beauty and magnificence, and enriches us with his wealth, hence we\nderive most abundant cause for glorying, and even confidence, to enable us\nto contend with intrepidity against the devil, sin, and death. In the last\nplace, since we are clothed with his righteousness, we may boldly rise\nsuperior to all the reproaches of the world; and as he liberally\nreplenishes us with his favours, so we ought on our part to bring forth\nfruit to his glory.\nV. His regal unction, therefore, is not represented to us as composed of\noil and aromatic perfumes; but he is called “the Christ of God,”(1226)\nbecause “the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and\nmight, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord,”(1227) rested\nupon him. This is the “oil of gladness,” with which the Psalmist declares\nhim to have been “anointed above” his “fellows;”(1228) because, if he were\nnot possessed of such excellence, we should be all oppressed with poverty\nand famine. And, as we have observed, he was not enriched on his own\nprivate account, but that he might communicate his abundance to them who\nare hungry and thirsty. For as it is said that the Father “giveth not the\nSpirit by measure unto him,”(1229) so another passage expresses the\nreason—“that of his fulness we might all receive, and grace for\ngrace.”(1230) From this source proceeds the munificence mentioned by Paul,\nby which grace is variously distributed to the faithful, “according to the\nmeasure of the gift of Christ.”(1231) These passages abundantly confirm\nwhat I have said—that the kingdom of Christ consists in the Spirit, not in\nterrestrial pleasures or pomps; and that, therefore, in order to be\npartakers of it, we must renounce the world. A visible emblem of this\nunction was displayed at the baptism of Christ, when the Holy Spirit\nrested on him in the form of a dove. That the Holy Spirit and his gifts\nare designated by the word unction, ought not to be esteemed either novel\nor absurd, because we have no other support even for our animal life; but\nespecially as it respects the heavenly life, we have not a particle of\nvigour in us, but what we have received from the Holy Spirit, who has\nchosen his residence in Christ, that those heavenly riches, which we so\ngreatly need, may from him be copiously distributed to us. Now, as the\nfaithful stand invincible in the strength of their King, and are enriched\nwith his spiritual blessings, they are justly denominated Christians. But\nto this eternity, of which we have spoken, there is nothing repugnant in\nthese expressions of Paul: “Then he shall deliver up the kingdom to God,\neven the Father,” and “Then shall the Son himself be subject, that God may\nbe all in all.”(1232) He only intends, that in that perfect glory the\nadministration of the kingdom will not be the same as it is at present.\nFor the Father has given all power to the Son, that he may guide, nourish,\nand sustain us by his hand, may guard us by his protection, and aid us in\nall our necessities. Thus, during the period of our pilgrimage, while we\nare absent from God, Christ interposes between us, to bring us by degrees\nto a perfect union with him. His being said to sit at the right hand of\nthe Father, is equivalent to his being called the Father’s vicegerent,\nintrusted with all the power of the government; because it is the will of\nGod to govern and defend his Church through the mediation of his Son. This\nis the explanation given by Paul to the Ephesians, that he was “set at the\nright hand of the Father, to be the head over all things to the Church,\nwhich is his body.”(1233) To the same purpose is what he states in another\nplace, that there has been “given him a name which is above every name;\nthat at the name of Jesus every knee should bow; and that every tongue\nshould confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the\nFather.”(1234) For even in these words he displays the order in the\nkingdom of Christ necessary for our present infirmity. Thus Paul rightly\nconcludes, that God himself will then be the only head of the Church,\nbecause the functions of Christ in the preservation and salvation of the\nChurch will be fully discharged. For the same reason the Scripture often\nstyles him Lord, because the Father has given him authority over us, that\nhe may exercise his own dominion by the agency of his Son. “For though\nthere be” many authorities celebrated in the world, “to us there is but\none God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord\nJesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him,”(1235) says Paul.\nWhence it may justly be concluded, that he is the same God, who by the\nmouth of Isaiah has asserted himself to be the King and Lawgiver of his\nChurch.(1236) For though he every where ascribes all the authority he\npossesses to the free gift of the Father, yet he only signifies that he\nreigns in the majesty and power of God; because he assumed the character\nof Mediator, in order to approach to us by descending from the bosom and\nincomprehensible glory of his Father. Wherefore it is the more reasonable\nthat we should all with one consent be ready to obey him, and with the\ngreatest alacrity conform all our services to his will. For as he combines\nthe offices of a King and a Shepherd towards the faithful who yield a\nvoluntary obedience, so, on the contrary, we are informed, that he bears\n“a rod of iron” to “break” all the stubborn and rebellious, and to “dash\nthem in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”(1237) It is likewise predicted\nthat “he shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the\ndead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.”(1238) Of this\nthere are some instances to be seen in the present state, but the complete\naccomplishment of it will be at the last judgment, which may also with\npropriety be considered as the last act of his reign.\nVI. Concerning his priesthood, we have briefly to remark, that the end and\nuse of it is, that he may be a Mediator pure from every stain, and by his\nholiness may render us acceptable to God. But because the righteous curse\nprevents our access to him, and God in his character of Judge is offended\nwith us,—in order that our Priest may appease the wrath of God, and\nprocure his favour for us, there is a necessity for the intervention of an\natonement. Wherefore, that Christ might perform this office, it was\nnecessary for him to appear with a sacrifice. For even under the law the\npriest was not permitted to enter the sanctuary without blood; that the\nfaithful might know, that notwithstanding the interposition of the Priest\nas an intercessor, yet it was impossible for God to be propitiated without\nthe expiation of sins. This subject the apostle discusses at large in the\nEpistle to the Hebrews, from the seventh chapter almost to the end of the\ntenth. But the sum of the whole is this—that the sacerdotal dignity\nbelongs exclusively to Christ, because, by the sacrifice of his death, he\nhas abolished our guilt, and made satisfaction for our sins. The vast\nimportance of this we are taught by that solemn oath which “the Lord hath\nsworn, and will not repent; Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of\nMelchisedec.”(1239) For there is no doubt that God intended to establish\nthat capital point, which he knew to be the principal hinge on which our\nsalvation turns. And as we have observed, there is no access to God,\neither for ourselves or our prayers, unless our Priest sanctify us by\ntaking away our sins, and obtain for us that grace from which we are\nexcluded by the pollution of our vices and crimes. Thus, we see, it is\nnecessary to begin with the death of Christ, in order to experience the\nefficacy and utility of his priesthood. Hence it follows, that he is an\neternal intercessor, and that it is by his intervention we obtain favour\nwith God. Hence proceeds not only confidence in prayer, but also\ntranquillity to the consciences of the faithful; while they recline in\nsafety on the paternal indulgence of God, and are certainly persuaded,\nthat he is pleased with whatever is consecrated to him through the\nMediator. Now, as under the law God commanded victims to be offered to him\nfrom the flock and the herd, a new and different method has been adopted\nin the case of Christ, that the sacrifice should be the same with the\npriest; because it was impossible to find any other adequate satisfaction\nfor sins, or any one worthy of so great an honour as to offer to God his\nonly begotten Son. Besides, Christ sustains the character of a Priest, not\nonly to render the Father favourable and propitious to us by an eternal\nlaw of reconciliation, but also to associate us with himself in so great\nan honour. For we, who are polluted in ourselves, being “made\npriests”(1240) in him, offer ourselves and all our services to God, and\nenter boldly into the heavenly sanctuary, so that the sacrifices of\nprayers and praise, which proceed from us, are “acceptable,” and “a sweet‐\nsmelling savour”(1241) in the Divine presence. This is included in the\ndeclaration of Christ, “For their sakes I sanctify myself;”(1242) for\nbeing arrayed in his holiness, he having dedicated us, together with\nhimself, to the Father, we, who are otherwise offensive in his sight,\nbecome acceptable to him, as pure, unpolluted, and holy. This is the\nmeaning of the “anointing of the Most Holy,”(1243) which is mentioned in\nDaniel. For we must observe the contrast between this unction and that\nshadowy unction which was then in use; as though the angel had said, that\nthe shadows would be dissipated, and that there would be a real priesthood\nin the person of Christ. So much the more detestable is the invention of\nthose, who, not content with the priesthood of Christ, have presumed to\ntake upon themselves the office of sacrificing him; which is daily\nattempted among the Papists, where the mass is considered as an immolation\nof Christ."

          "title": "Chapter XVI. Christ’s Execution Of The Office Of A Redeemer To Procure Our",
          "content": "Salvation. His Death, Resurrection, And Ascension To Heaven.\nAll that we have hitherto advanced concerning Christ is to be referred to\nthis point, that being condemned, dead, and ruined in ourselves, we should\nseek righteousness, deliverance, life, and salvation in him; as we are\ntaught by this remarkable declaration of Peter, that “there is none other\nname under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”(1244) The\nname of JESUS was given him, not rashly or by a fortuitous accident, or by\nthe will of men, but was brought from heaven by the angel, the herald of\nthe supreme decree, and also with this reason annexed to it: “for he shall\nsave his people from their sins;”(1245) in which words may be remarked,\nwhat we have before hinted, that the office of a Redeemer was assigned to\nhim in order that he might be our Saviour. Nevertheless, the redemption\nwould be incomplete, if he did not by continual advances carry us forward\nto the ultimate end of salvation. Therefore, as soon as we deviate from\nhim, though but in the smallest degree, we gradually lose sight of\nsalvation, which resides entirely in him; so that those who are not\nsatisfied with him, voluntarily deprive themselves of all grace. And the\nfollowing observation of Bernard is worthy of recital: “that the name of\nJesus is not only light, but also food; that it is likewise oil, without\nwhich all the food of the soul is dry; that it is salt, unseasoned by\nwhich, whatever is presented to us is insipid; finally, that it is honey\nin the mouth, melody in the ear, joy in the heart, and medicine to the\nsoul; and that there are no charms in any discourse where his name is not\nheard.” But here we ought diligently to examine how he has procured\nsalvation for us; that we may not only know him to be the author of it,\nbut, embracing those things which are sufficient for the establishment of\nour faith, may reject every thing capable of drawing us aside to the right\nhand or to the left. For since no man can descend into himself and\nseriously consider his own character, without perceiving that God is angry\nwith him and hostile to him, and consequently he must find himself under a\nnecessity of anxiously seeking some way to appease him, which can never be\ndone without a satisfaction,—this is a case in which the strongest\nassurance is required. For sinners, till they be delivered from guilt, are\nalways subject to the wrath and malediction of God, who, being a righteous\nJudge, never suffers his law to be violated with impunity, but stands\nprepared to avenge it.\nII. Before we proceed any further, let us examine, by the way, how it\ncould be consistent, that God, who prevents us with his mercy, should be\nour enemy, till he was reconciled to us by Christ. For how could he have\ngiven us a special pledge of his love in his only begotten Son, if he had\nnot previously embraced us in his gratuitous favour? As there is some\nappearance of contradiction, therefore, in this representation, I shall\nsolve the difficulty. The Spirit speaks in the Scriptures nearly in this\nmanner—That God was an enemy to men, till by the death of Christ they were\nrestored to his favour;(1246) that they were under the curse till their\niniquity was expiated by his sacrifice;(1247) that they were separated\nfrom God, till they were restored to union with him by the body of\nChrist.(1248) Such modes of expression are accommodated to our capacity,\nthat we may better understand how miserable and calamitous our condition\nis, out of Christ. For if it were not clearly expressed, that we are\nobnoxious to the wrath and vengeance of God, and to eternal death, we\nshould not so fully discover how miserable we must be without the Divine\nmercy, nor should we so highly estimate the blessing of deliverance. For\nexample; let any man be addressed in the following manner: “If, while you\nremained a sinner, God had hated you, and rejected you according to your\ndemerits, horrible destruction would have befallen you; but because he has\nvoluntarily, and of his own gratuitous kindness, retained you in his\nfavour, and not permitted you to be alienated from him, he has thus\ndelivered you from that danger;” he will be affected, and will in some\nmeasure perceive how much he is indebted to the Divine mercy. But if, on\nthe contrary, he be told, what the Scripture teaches, “that he was\nalienated from God by sin, an heir of wrath, obnoxious to the punishment\nof eternal death, excluded from all hope of salvation, a total stranger to\nthe Divine blessing, a slave to Satan, a captive under the yoke of sin,\nand, in a word, condemned to, and already involved in, a horrible\ndestruction; that in this situation, Christ interposed as an intercessor;\nthat he has taken upon himself and suffered the punishment which by the\nrighteous judgment of God impended over all sinners; that by his blood he\nhas expiated those crimes which render them odious to God; that by this\nexpiation God the Father has been satisfied and duly atoned; that by this\nintercessor his wrath has been appeased; that this is the foundation of\npeace between God and men; that this is the bond of his benevolence\ntowards them;” will he not be the more affected by these things in\nproportion to the more correct and lively representation of the depth of\ncalamity from which he has been delivered? In short, since it is\nimpossible for the life which is presented by the mercy of God, to be\nembraced by our hearts with sufficient ardour, or received with becoming\ngratitude, unless we have been previously terrified and distressed with\nthe fear of the Divine wrath, and the horror of eternal death, we are\ninstructed by the sacred doctrine, that irrespective of Christ we may\ncontemplate God as in some measure incensed against us, and his hand armed\nfor our destruction, and that we may embrace his benevolence and paternal\nlove only in Christ.\nIII. Now, though this is expressed according to the weakness of our\ncapacity, yet it is strictly true. For God, who is the perfection of\nrighteousness, cannot love iniquity, which he beholds in us all. We all,\ntherefore, have in us that which deserves God’s hatred. Wherefore, in\nrespect of our corrupt nature, and the succeeding depravity of our lives,\nwe are all really offensive to God, guilty in his sight, and born to the\ndamnation of hell. But because the Lord will not lose in us that which is\nhis own, he yet discovers something that his goodness may love. For\nnotwithstanding we are sinners through our own fault, yet we are still his\ncreatures; notwithstanding we have brought death upon ourselves, yet he\nhad created us for life. Thus, by a pure and gratuitous love towards us,\nhe is excited to receive us into favour. But if there is a perpetual and\nirreconcilable opposition between righteousness and iniquity, he cannot\nreceive us entirely, as long as we remain sinners. Therefore, to remove\nall occasion of enmity, and to reconcile us completely to himself, he\nabolishes all our guilt, by the expiation exhibited in the death of\nChrist, that we, who before were polluted and impure, may appear righteous\nand holy in his sight. The love of God the Father therefore precedes our\nreconciliation in Christ; or rather it is because he first loves, that he\nafterwards reconciles us to himself.(1249) But because, till Christ\nrelieves us by his death, we are not freed from that iniquity which\ndeserves the indignation of God, and is accursed and condemned in his\nsight; we have not a complete and solid union with God, before we are\nunited to him by Christ. And therefore, if we would assure ourselves that\nGod is pacified and propitious to us, we must fix our eyes and hearts on\nChrist alone, since it is by him only that we really obtain the non‐\nimputation of sins, the imputation of which is connected with the Divine\nwrath.\nIV. For this reason Paul says, that the love which God had for us before\nthe creation of the world, was founded on Christ.(1250) This doctrine is\nclear, and consistent with the Scripture, and admirably reconciles the\ndifferent passages, where it is said, that God manifested his love to us\nby the gift of his only begotten Son,(1251) and yet that he was our enemy\ntill he was reconciled by the death of Christ.(1252) But for a further\nconfirmation of it, to such as require the testimony of the ancient\nChurch, I will cite a passage from Augustine, which expressly maintains\nthe same. “The love of God,” says he, “is incomprehensible and immutable.\nFor he did not begin to love us when we were reconciled to him by the\nblood of his Son, but he loved us before the creation of the world, that\nwe might be his children, together with his only begotten Son, even before\nwe had any existence. Therefore our reconciliation by the death of Christ\nmust not be understood as if he reconciled us to God, that God might begin\nto love those whom he had before hated; but we are reconciled to him who\nalready loved us, but with whom we were at enmity on account of sin. And\nwhether my assertion be true, let the apostle attest. ‘God,’ says he,\n‘commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ\ndied for us.’(1253) He loved us, therefore, even when we were in the\nexercise of enmity against him, and engaged in the practice of iniquity.\nWherefore, in a wonderful and Divine manner, he both hated and loved us at\nthe same time. He hated us, as being different from what he had made us;\nbut as our iniquity had not entirely destroyed his work in us, he could at\nthe same time in every one of us hate what we had done, and love what\nproceeded from himself.” This is the language of Augustine.\nV. Now, in answer to the inquiry, how Christ, by the abolition of our\nsins, has destroyed the enmity between God and us, and procured a\nrighteousness to render him favourable and propitious to us, it may be\nreplied in general, that he accomplished it for us by the whole course of\nhis obedience. This is proved by the testimony of Paul. “As by one man’s\ndisobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many\nbe made righteous.”(1254) And indeed in another place he extends the cause\nof the pardon, which exempts us from the malediction of the law, to the\nwhole life of Christ. “When the fulness of the time was come, God sent\nforth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that\nwere under the law.”(1255) Thus he himself affirmed even his baptism to be\na branch of his righteousness, because he acted in obedience to the\ncommand of the Father.(1256) In short, from the time of his assuming the\ncharacter of a servant, he began to pay the price of our deliverance in\norder to redeem us. Yet more precisely to define the means of our\nsalvation, the Scripture ascribes this in a peculiar manner to the death\nof Christ. He himself announces, that he “gives his life a ransom for\nmany.”(1257) Paul teaches that “he died for our sins.”(1258) John the\nBaptist exclaims, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of\nthe world!”(1259) Paul in another place declares, that we are “justified\nfreely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom\nGod hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.”(1260)\nAlso that we are “justified by his blood,” and “reconciled by his\ndeath.”(1261) Again: “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;\nthat we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1262) I shall not\nproceed with all the proofs, because the catalogue would be immense, and\nmany of them must hereafter be cited in their proper order. Wherefore, in\nwhat is called the Apostles’ Creed, there is very properly an immediate\ntransition from the birth of Christ to his death and resurrection, in\nwhich the sum of perfect salvation consists. Yet there is no exclusion of\nthe rest of the obedience which he performed in his life; as Paul\ncomprehends the whole of it, from the beginning to the end, when he says,\nthat “he made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a\nservant, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the\ncross.”(1263) And indeed his voluntary submission is the principal\ncircumstance even in his death; because the sacrifice, unless freely\noffered, would have been unavailable to the acquisition of righteousness.\nTherefore our Lord, after having declared, “I lay down my life for the\nsheep,” expressly adds, “No man taketh it from me.”(1264) In which sense\nIsaiah says, “As a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not\nhis mouth.”(1265) And the evangelical history relates, that he went forth\nto meet the soldiers,(1266) and that before Pilate he neglected making any\ndefence, and waited to submit to the sentence.(1267) Nor was this without\ninward conflict, because he had taken our infirmities, and it was\nnecessary to give this proof of his obedience to his Father. And it was no\nmean specimen of his incomparable love to us, to contend with horrible\nfear, and amid those dreadful torments to neglect all care of himself,\nthat he might promote our benefit. Indeed we must admit, that it was\nimpossible for God to be truly appeased in any other way, than by Christ\nrenouncing all concern for himself, and submitting and devoting himself\nentirely to his will. On this subject the apostle appositely cites the\ntestimony of the Psalmist: “Then said I, Lo, I come; in the volume of the\nbook it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law\nis within my heart.”(1268) But since terrified consciences find no rest\nbut in a sacrifice and ablution to expiate their sins, we are properly\ndirected thither, and the death of Christ is exhibited to us as the source\nof life. Now, because our guilt rendered us liable to a curse at the\nheavenly tribunal of God, the condemnation of Christ before Pontius\nPilate, the governor of Judea, is stated in the first place, that we may\nknow that on this righteous person was inflicted the punishment which\nbelonged to us. We could not escape the terrible judgment of God; to\ndeliver us from it, Christ submitted to be condemned even before a wicked\nand profane mortal. For the name of the governor is mentioned, not only to\nestablish the credit of the history, but that we may learn, what is taught\nby Isaiah, that “the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his\nstripes we are healed.”(1269) For to supersede our condemnation it was not\nsufficient for him to suffer any kind of death; but, to accomplish our\nredemption, that kind of death was to be chosen, by which, both sustaining\nour condemnation and atoning for our sins, he might deliver us from both.\nHad he been assassinated by robbers, or murdered in a popular tumult, in\nsuch a death there would have been no appearance of satisfaction. But when\nhe is placed as a criminal before the tribunal,—when he is accused and\noverpowered by the testimony of witnesses, and by the mouth of the judge\nis condemned to die,—we understand from these circumstances, that he\nsustained the character of a malefactor. And we shall remark two things\nwhich were foretold in the predictions of the prophets, and afford\npeculiar consolation and confirmation to our faith. For when we are told,\nthat Christ was sent from the tribunal of the judge to the place of\nexecution, and suspended between two thieves, we see the completion of\nthat prophecy, which is cited by the Evangelist, “He was numbered with the\ntransgressors.”(1270) For what reason? to sustain the character of a\nsinner, not of a righteous or innocent person. For he died, not for his\ninnocence, but on account of sin. On the contrary, when we hear him\nabsolved by the same mouth by which he was condemned, (for Pilate was\nconstrained repeatedly to give a public testimony of his innocence,)(1271)\nlet it remind us of what we read in another prophet: “I restored that\nwhich I took not away.”(1272) Thus we shall behold Christ sustaining the\ncharacter of a sinner and malefactor, while from the lustre of his\ninnocence it will at the same time evidently appear, that he was loaded\nwith the guilt of others, but had none of his own. He suffered, then,\nunder Pontius Pilate, after having been condemned as a criminal by the\nsolemn sentence of the governor; yet not in such a manner, but that he was\nat the same time pronounced to be righteous, by the declaration of the\nsame judge, that he found in him no cause of accusation. This is our\nabsolution, that the guilt, which made us obnoxious to punishment, is\ntransferred to the person of the Son of God. For we ought particularly to\nremember this satisfaction, that we may not spend our whole lives in\nterror and anxiety, as though we were pursued by the righteous vengeance\nof God, which the Son of God has transferred to himself.\nVI. Moreover, the species of death which he suffered, is fraught with a\npeculiar mystery. The cross was accursed, not only in the opinion of men,\nbut by the decree of the Divine law. Therefore, when Christ is lifted up\nupon it, he renders himself obnoxious to the curse. And this was necessary\nto be done, that by this transfer we might be delivered from every curse\nwhich awaited us, or rather was already inflicted upon us, on account of\nour iniquities. This was also prefigured in the law. For the victims and\nexpiations offered for sins were called אשמות, a word which properly\nsignifies sin itself. By this appellation the Spirit intended to suggest\nthat they were vicarious sacrifices, to receive and sustain the curse due\nto sin. But that which was figuratively represented in the Mosaic\nsacrifices, is actually exhibited in Christ, the archetype of the figures.\nWherefore, in order to effect a complete expiation, he gave his soul אשם,\nthat is, _an atoning sacrifice for sin_,(1273) as the prophet says; so\nthat our guilt and punishment being as it were transferred to him, they\nmust cease to be imputed to us. The apostle more explicitly testifies the\nsame, when he says, “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;\nthat we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1274) For the Son\nof God, though perfectly free from all sin, nevertheless assumed the\ndisgrace and ignominy of our iniquities, and, on the other hand, arrayed\nus in his purity. He appears to have intended the same, when he says\nconcerning sin, that it was “condemned in the flesh,”(1275) that is, in\nChrist. For the Father destroyed the power of sin, when the curse of it\nwas transferred to the body of Christ. This expression therefore\nindicates, that Christ at his death was offered to the Father as an\nexpiatory sacrifice, in order that, a complete atonement being made by his\noblation, we may no longer dread the Divine wrath. Now, it is evident what\nthe prophet meant, when he said, “The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity\nof us all;”(1276) namely, that when he was about to expiate our sins, they\nwere transferred to him by imputation. The cross, to which he was fixed,\nwas a symbol of this, as the apostle informs us: “Christ hath redeemed us\nfrom the curse of the law, being made a curse for us; for it is written,\nCursed is every one that hangeth on a tree; that the blessing of Abraham\nmight come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ.”(1277) Peter alluded to\nthe same, where he said, “He bare our sins in his own body on the\ntree;”(1278) because from the visible symbol of the curse, we more clearly\napprehend, that the burden, with which we were oppressed, was imposed on\nhim. Nor must we conceive that he submitted to a curse which overwhelmed\nhim, but, on the contrary, that by sustaining it, he depressed, broke, and\ndestroyed all its power. Wherefore faith apprehends an absolution in the\ncondemnation of Christ, and a benediction in his curse. It is not without\nreason, therefore, that Paul magnificently proclaims the triumph which\nChrist gained for himself on the cross; as though the cross, which was\nfull of ignominy, had been converted into a triumphal chariot. For he\nsays, that “he nailed to his cross the hand‐writing, which was contrary to\nus, and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them\nopenly.”(1279) Nor should this surprise us; for, according to the\ntestimony of another apostle, “Christ offered himself through the eternal\nSpirit.”(1280) Hence arose that change of the nature of things. But that\nthese things may be deeply rooted and firmly fixed in our hearts, let us\nalways remember his sacrifice and ablution. For we certainly could have no\nconfidence that Christ was our (απολυτρωσις,(1281) και αντιλυτρον,(1282)\nκαι ἱλαστηριον,)(1283) redemption, ransom, and propitiation, if he had not\nbeen a slaughtered victim. And for this reason it is, that when the\nScripture exhibits the method of redemption, it so often makes mention of\nblood; though the blood shed by Christ has not only served as an atonement\nto God, but likewise as a laver to purge away our pollutions.\nVII. It follows in the Creed, “that he died and was buried;” in which may\nbe further seen, how in every respect he substituted himself in our room\nto pay the price of our redemption. Death held us in bondage under his\nyoke; Christ, to deliver us from it, surrendered himself to his power in\nour stead. This is the meaning of the apostle, when he says, that “he\ntasted death for every man.”(1284) For by his death he prevented us from\ndying, or, which comes to the same thing, by his death recovered life for\nus. But in this respect he differed from us—he surrendered himself to\ndeath to be, as it were, overcome by it, not that he might be absorbed in\nits abysses, but rather that he might destroy that, by which we should\nhave been at length devoured; he surrendered himself to death to be\nsubdued, not that he might be overwhelmed by its power, but rather that he\nmight overthrow that which threatened us, which indeed had already\novercome us, and was triumphing over us. Lastly, he died, “that he might\ndestroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver\nthem who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to\nbondage.”(1285) This is the first benefit we have received from his death.\nThe second is, that, by a communication of himself, he “mortifies” our\n“members which are upon the earth,”(1286) that they may no longer perform\ntheir own actions; and slays our old man, that it may not flourish and\nbear fruit any more. The burial of Christ has the same tendency, namely,\nthat being made partakers of it, we may be buried to sin. For when the\napostle teaches us that “we have been planted in the likeness of the death\nof Christ, and buried with him,”(1287) to the death of sin; that “by his\ncross the world is crucified” unto us, and we “unto the world;”(1288) and\nthat we “are dead with him;”(1289) he not only exhorts us to imitate the\nexample of his death, but declares that it contains such an efficacy, as\nought to be conspicuous in all Christians, unless they wish to render that\ndeath ineffectual and useless. In the death and burial of Christ,\ntherefore, we have a twofold benefit proposed to our enjoyment—deliverance\nfrom the thraldom of death, and the mortification of our flesh.\nVIII. But it is not right to omit his “descent into hell,” which is of no\nsmall importance towards the accomplishment of redemption. For though it\nappears from the writings of the ancients, that this article of the Creed\nwas not always in common use in the churches, yet in discussing a system\nof doctrine, it is necessary to introduce it, as containing a mystery\nhighly useful, and by no means to be despised. Indeed, there are some of\nthe ancients who do not omit it. Hence we may conjecture that it was\ninserted a little after the days of the apostles, and was not immediately\nbut gradually received in the churches. This at least cannot be\ncontroverted, that it was agreeable to the general opinion of all the\nfaithful; since there is not one of the fathers, who does not mention in\nhis writings the descent of Christ into hell, though they explain it in\ndifferent senses. But by whom, or at what period, it was first inserted,\nis of little consequence; it is of more importance that the Creed should\npresent us a full and complete summary of faith, into which nothing should\nbe inserted, but what is taken from God’s most holy word. Yet if any\nmorosely refuse to admit it into the Creed, it shall presently be proved\nto be so necessary to the perfection of our redemption, that the omission\nof it considerably lessens the benefit of the death of Christ. Some,\nagain, are of opinion, that this clause contains nothing new, but is only\na repetition, in other words, of what had before been said respecting his\nburial; because the word here rendered “hell” is frequently used in the\nScriptures to signify the grave. I admit the truth of their observation\nrespecting the signification of this word, that it is frequently to be\nunderstood of the “grave;” but their opinion is opposed by two reasons,\nwhich easily induce me to dissent from them. For what extreme carelessness\nit would betray, after a plain fact had been stated in the most explicit\nand familiar manner, to assert it a second time in an obscure combination\nof words calculated rather to perplex than to elucidate it! For when two\nphrases expressive of the same thing are connected together, the latter\nought to be an explanation of the former. But what an explanation would\nthis be, if one were to express it thus: “When Christ is said to have been\nburied, the meaning is, that he descended into hell!” Besides, it is not\nprobable that such a superfluous tautology could have found its way into\nthis compendium, in which the principal articles of faith are summarily\nexpressed with the utmost possible brevity. And I doubt not, that all who\nhave considered this point with any attention will easily assent to what I\nhave advanced.\nIX. Others give a different interpretation; that Christ descended to the\nsouls of the fathers who had died under the law, for the purpose of\nannouncing the accomplishment of redemption, and liberating them from the\nprison in which they were confined. To this purpose they pervert a passage\nin the psalms, that “he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars\nof iron in sunder;”(1290) and another in Zechariah, “I have sent forth thy\nprisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.”(1291) But since the\nPsalmist celebrates the liberation of those who are suffering captivity\nand imprisonment in distant countries; and Zechariah compares the\ndestruction in which the people had been overwhelmed in Babylon, to a dry\npit or abyss; and at the same time suggests, that the salvation of the\nwhole Church is a deliverance from the abysses of hell; I know not how it\ncame to pass, that posterity should imagine a subterraneous cavern, to\nwhich they have given the name of Limbus. But this fable, although it is\nmaintained by great authors, and even in the present age is by many\nseriously defended as a truth, is after all nothing but a fable. For to\nconfine the souls of the dead in a prison, is quite puerile; but what\nnecessity was there for Christ to descend thither in order to liberate\nthem? I freely confess, indeed, that Christ illuminated them by the power\nof his Spirit; that they might know that the grace, which they had only\ntasted by hope, was then exhibited to the world. And probably to this we\nmay accommodate that passage of Peter, where he says, that Christ “went\nand preached unto the spirits who were keeping watch as in a tower.”(1292)\nThis is generally rendered “the spirits in prison,” but I conceive\nimproperly. The context also gives us to understand, that the faithful who\nhad died before that time, were partakers of the same grace with us. For\nthe apostle amplifies the efficacy of the death of Christ from this\nconsideration, that it penetrated even to the dead; when the souls of the\nfaithful enjoyed the present view of that visitation which they had been\nanxiously expecting; whilst, on the contrary, it was more clearly\ndiscovered to the reprobate, that they were excluded from all salvation.\nBut since Peter has not spoken in this distinct manner of the pious and\nthe impious, we must not understand him as confounding them all together,\nwithout any discrimination. He only designs to inform us, that the\nknowledge of the death of Christ was common to them both.\nX. But laying aside all consideration of the Creed, we have to seek for a\nmore certain explanation of the descent of Christ into hell; and we find\none in the Divine word, not only holy and pious, but likewise replete with\nsingular consolation. If Christ had merely died a corporeal death, no end\nwould have been accomplished by it; it was requisite, also, that he should\nfeel the severity of the Divine vengeance, in order to appease the wrath\nof God, and satisfy his justice. Hence it was necessary for him to contend\nwith the powers of hell and the horror of eternal death. We have already\nstated from the prophet, that “the chastisement of our peace was upon\nhim,” that “he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our\niniquities;”(1293) the meaning of which is, that he was made a substitute\nand surety for transgressors, and even treated as a criminal himself, to\nsustain all the punishments which would have been inflicted on them; only\nwith this exception, that “it was not possible that he should be holden of\nthe pains of death.”(1294) Therefore it is no wonder, if he be said to\nhave descended into hell, since he suffered that death which the wrath of\nGod inflicts on transgressors. It is a very frivolous and even ridiculous\nobjection to say that by this explanation the order of things is\nperverted, because it is absurd to make that subsequent to his burial,\nwhich really preceded it. For the relation of those sufferings of Christ,\nwhich were visible to men, is very properly followed by that invisible and\nincomprehensible vengeance which he suffered from the hand of God; in\norder to assure us that not only the body of Christ was given as the price\nof our redemption, but that there was another greater and more excellent\nransom, since he suffered in his soul the dreadful torments of a person\ncondemned and irretrievably lost.\nXI. In this sense Peter says, that “God raised him up, having loosed the\npains of death; because it was not possible that he should be holden of\nit.”(1295) He does not say simply “death;” but tells us, that the Son of\nGod was involved in “the pains of death,” which proceed from the Divine\nwrath and malediction, which is the origin of death. For what a little\nthing it would have been for Christ to appear in order to suffer death,\nwithout any distress or perplexity, and even with pleasure! But this was a\ntrue specimen of his infinite mercy, not to evade that death which he so\nmuch dreaded. Nor can it be doubted, but the apostle means to suggest the\nsame in the Epistle to the Hebrews, when he says, that Christ “was heard\nin that he feared.”(1296) Some, instead of fear, translate it reverence or\npiety; but how improperly, is evident from the subject itself, and also\nfrom the form of expression. Christ, therefore, “when he offered up\nprayers with strong crying and tears, was heard in that he feared;” not\nthat he might obtain an exemption from death, but that he might not be\nswallowed up by it as a sinner; for he was then sustaining our character.\nAnd it is certainly impossible to imagine any more formidable abyss, than\nto perceive ourselves forsaken and abandoned by God, and not to be heard\nwhen we call upon him, as though he had conspired to destroy us. Now, we\nsee Christ was so deeply dejected, that in the urgency of distress, he was\nconstrained to exclaim, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”(1297)\nFor the idea of some, that he spoke rather according to the opinion of\nothers than from his own feelings, is utterly improbable; since he\nevidently appears to have spoken from the anguish of his inmost soul. We\ndo not admit that God was ever hostile to him, or angry with him. For how\ncould he be angry with his beloved Son, “in whom his soul\ndelighted?”(1298) or how could Christ, by his intercession, appease the\nFather for others, if the Father were incensed against him? But we affirm,\nthat he sustained the weight of the Divine severity; since, being “smitten\nand afflicted of God,”(1299) he experienced from God all the tokens of\nwrath and vengeance. Wherefore, Hilary argues, that by this descent we\nhave obtained the destruction of death. And in other places he accords\nwith our opinion; as when he says, “The cross, death, and hell, are our\nlife.” Again, in another place, “The Son of God is in hell, but man is\nraised to heaven.” But why do I cite the testimony of a private person,\nwhen the apostle asserts the same thing, mentioning, as the reward of\nChrist’s victory, the deliverance of them “who, through fear of death,\nwere all their lifetime subject to bondage?”(1300) It was necessary,\ntherefore, that he should overcome that fear, which naturally and\nincessantly harasses all men; which he could not do without contending\nwith it. Now, that his was not a common or trivial sorrow, will soon be\nmore clearly evinced. Thus, by contending with the power of the devil,\nwith the dread of death, and with the pains of hell, he obtained the\nvictory, and triumphed over them, that in death we may no longer dread\nthose things which our Prince has destroyed.\nXII. Here some contentious, though illiterate men, impelled rather by\nmalice than by ignorance, exclaim against me, that I am guilty of an\natrocious injury to Christ; because it is utterly unreasonable that he\nshould have any fear concerning the salvation of his soul. And then they\naggravate the cavil, by pretending that I attribute despair to the Son of\nGod, which is contrary to faith. In the first place, it is presumptuous in\nthem to raise a controversy concerning the fear and consternation of\nChrist, which is so expressly asserted by the evangelists. For, before the\napproach of his death, he experienced a perturbation of spirit and\ndepression of mind; but, in the actual struggle with it, he began to feel\na greater degree of consternation. If they say that this was only\npretence, it is a most paltry subterfuge. We ought, therefore, as Ambrose\njustly advises, fearlessly to acknowledge the sorrow of Christ, unless we\nare ashamed of his cross. And, indeed, if his soul had experienced no\npunishment, he would have been only a Redeemer for the body. It was\nnecessary for him to combat, in order to raise up those who lay prostrate\non the earth; and his heavenly glory is so far from being diminished by\nthis, that his goodness, which is never sufficiently celebrated, is\nconspicuous in his voluntary and unreluctant assumption of our\ninfirmities. Hence that consolation which the apostle offers us under our\nanxieties and sorrows, that this Mediator has experienced our infirmities,\nin order that he might be the more ready to succour the wretched.(1301)\nThey pretend, that what is intrinsically bad cannot be justly attributed\nto Christ; as though they were wiser than the Spirit of God, who connects\nthese two things together, that Christ “was in all points tempted like as\nwe are, yet without sin.” We have no reason, therefore, to be alarmed by\nthe infirmity of Christ, to which he was not compelled by violence or\nnecessity, but induced merely by his mercy and love for us voluntarily to\nsubmit himself. But none of his voluntary sufferings for us have been any\ndiminution of his power. These captious objectors, however, are deceived\nin one point; they do not perceive that this infirmity in Christ was\nperfectly free from every stain of guilt, because he always kept himself\nwithin the limits of obedience. For, because no moderation can be\ndiscovered in the corruption of our nature, where all our passions\ntransgress all bounds with impetuous violence, they erroneously measure\nthe Son of God by this standard. But he being innocent, and free from\nevery defect, all his affections were governed by a moderation which\nadmitted of no excess. Whence it was very possible for him to resemble us\nin sorrow, fear, and dread, and yet, in this respect, to be very different\nfrom us. Refuted here, they proceed to another cavil; that, although\nChrist was afraid of death, yet he was not afraid of the malediction and\nwrath of God, from which he knew himself to be safe. But let the pious\nreader consider how much honour it reflects on Christ, that he was more\ndelicate and timorous than the generality of mankind. Robbers and other\nmalefactors obstinately rush forward to death; many men nobly despise it;\nothers calmly submit to it. But what constancy or magnanimity would the\nSon of God have discovered, in being astonished and almost struck dead\nwith the fear of it? For it is related of him, what might generally be\naccounted a prodigy, that through the vehemence of his agonies, drops of\nblood flowed from his face. Nor did he exhibit this spectacle to the eyes\nof others; he sent up his groans to his Father, in the secrecy of\nretirement. And every doubt is removed by the necessity that there was for\nangels to descend from heaven, to support him with unusual consolation.\nWhat disgraceful effeminacy, as I have suggested, would this have been, to\nbe so distressed by the fear of a common death, as to be in a bloody\nsweat, and incapable of being comforted without the presence of angels!\nWhat! does not this prayer, which he repeated three times, “O my Father,\nif it be possible, let this cup pass from me,”(1302) proceeding from an\nincredible bitterness of soul, demonstrate that Christ had a more severe\nand arduous conflict than with a common death? Whence it appears, that\nthose triflers, with whom I am now disputing, presumptuously chatter about\nthings which they know not; because they never seriously considered the\nnature or the importance of our redemption from the Divine judgment. But\nit is our wisdom to have a clear understanding how much our salvation cost\nthe Son of God. If any one inquire whether Christ was then descending to\nhell, when he deprecated death, I reply, that this was the prelude to it;\nwhence we may conclude what dreadful and horrible agonies he must have\nsuffered, while he was conscious of standing at the tribunal of God\naccused as a criminal on our account. But, although the Divine power of\nthe Spirit concealed itself for a moment, to give place to the infirmity\nof the flesh, yet we know, that the temptation arising from a sense of\ngrief and fear was such as was not repugnant to faith. And thus was\nfulfilled what we find in the sermon of Peter, “that it was not possible\nthat he should be holden of the pains of death;”(1303) because, when he\nperceived himself, as it were, deserted by God, still he relaxed not in\nthe least from his confidence in his Father’s goodness. This is evident\nfrom his celebrated invocation, when, through the vehemence of grief, he\nexclaimed, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”(1304) For\nnotwithstanding his extreme agony, yet he continues to call God _his_ God,\neven when he complains that he is forsaken by him. Now, this serves to\nrefute the error of Apollinaris, and also of those who were called\nMonothelites. Apollinaris pretended that the eternal Spirit supplied the\nplace of a soul in Christ, so that he was but half a man, as though he\ncould expiate our sins without obedience to the Father. But where was the\ndisposition or will, requisite to obedience, but in his soul? which we\nknow was “troubled,”(1305) in order to dissipate all our fears, and obtain\npeace and rest for ours. Moreover, in opposition to the Monothelites, we\nsee, that what was contrary to his will as man, was agreeable to his will\nas God. I say nothing of his overcoming the fear of which we have spoken,\nby a contrary disposition. For there is a manifest appearance of\ncontrariety when he says, “Father, save me from this hour: but for this\ncause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name.”(1306) Yet, in this\nperplexity, there is no such want of moderation as is evident in us, even\nwhile we are exerting our most strenuous endeavours to conquer ourselves.\nXIII. Next follows his resurrection from the dead, without which all that\nwe have said would be incomplete. For, since there appears nothing but\ninfirmity in the cross, death, and burial of Christ, faith must proceed\nbeyond all these things, to be furnished with sufficient strength.\nWherefore, although our salvation is perfectly accomplished by his death,\nbecause by that we are reconciled to God, a satisfaction is given to his\nrighteous judgment, the curse is removed, and the punishment sustained,\nyet we are said to have been “begotten again to a lively hope,” not by his\ndeath, but “by his resurrection from the dead.”(1307) For as at his\nresurrection he appeared the conqueror of death, so it is on his\nresurrection that our faith principally rests. This is better expressed in\nthe words of Paul, when he says, that Christ “was delivered for our\noffences, and was raised again for our justification;”(1308) as though he\nhad said, that sin was removed by his death, and righteousness renewed and\nrestored by his resurrection. For how was it possible for him by dying to\nliberate us from death, if he had himself remained under its power? how\ncould he have obtained the victory for us, if he had been vanquished in\nthe contest? Wherefore we ascribe our salvation partly to the death of\nChrist, and partly to his resurrection; we believe that sin was abolished,\nand death destroyed, by the former; that righteousness was restored, and\nlife established, by the latter; yet so that the former discovers its\npower and efficacy in us by means of the latter. Therefore Paul asserts\nthat he was “declared to be the Son of God, by the resurrection from the\ndead;”(1309) because he then displayed his heavenly power, which is both a\nlucid mirror of his Divinity, and a firm support of our faith. So, in\nanother place, he says, that “he was crucified through weakness, yet he\nliveth by the power of God.”(1310) In the same sense, in another place,\ntreating of perfection, he says, “that I may know him, and the power of\nhis resurrection.”(1311) Yet, immediately after, he adds, “the fellowship\nof his sufferings, and conformity to his death.” In perfect harmony with\nthis, is the following declaration of Peter: “God raised him up from the\ndead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God:”(1312)\nnot that faith totters when it rests on his death; but because “the power\nof God,” which “keeps us through faith,”(1313) chiefly discovers itself in\nhis resurrection. Let us remember, therefore, that whenever mention is\nmade of his death alone, it comprehends also what strictly belongs to his\nresurrection; and that the same figure of speech is applied to the word\n_resurrection_, whenever it is used without any mention of his death, so\nthat it connects with it what is peculiarly applicable to his death. But\nsince it was by rising from the dead that he obtained the palm of victory,\nto become the resurrection and the life, Paul justly contends, that, “if\nChrist be not risen, then is” the “preaching” of the gospel “vain, and”\nour “faith is also vain.”(1314) Therefore, in another place, after having\ngloried in the death of Christ in opposition to all the fears of\ncondemnation, he adds, by way of amplification, “Yea, rather, that is\nrisen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh\nintercession for us.”(1315) Besides, as we have before stated, that the\nmortification of our flesh depends on communion with his cross, so it must\nalso be understood, that we obtain another benefit, corresponding to that,\nfrom his resurrection. The apostle says, “If we have been planted together\nin the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his\nresurrection: even so we also should walk in newness of life.”(1316)\nTherefore, in another place, as, from our being dead with Christ, he\ndeduces an argument for the mortification of our members which are upon\nthe earth,(1317) so also, because we are risen with Christ, he thence\ninfers that we should seek those things which are above, and not those\nwhich are on the earth.(1318) By which expressions we are not only invited\nto walk in newness of life, after the example of Christ raised from the\ndead, but are taught that our regeneration to righteousness is effected by\nhis power. We derive also a third benefit from his resurrection, having\nreceived, as it were, a pledge to assure us of our own resurrection, of\nwhich his clearly affords the most solid foundation and evidence. This\nsubject the apostle discusses more at large in the First Epistle to the\nCorinthians.(1319) But it must be remarked by the way, that when he is\nsaid to have “risen from the dead,” this phrase expresses the reality both\nof his death and of his resurrection; as though it were said, that he died\nthe same death as other men naturally die, and received immortality in the\nsame body which he had assumed in a mortal state.\nXIV. His _resurrection_ is properly followed in the Creed by his\n_ascension to heaven_. For though Christ began to make a more illustrious\ndisplay of his glory and power at his resurrection, having now laid aside\nthe abject and ignoble condition of this mortal life, and the ignominy of\nthe cross, yet his ascension into heaven was the real commencement of his\nreign. This the apostle shows, when he informs us, that he “ascended that\nhe might fill all things.”(1320) Here, in an apparent contradiction, he\nsuggests to us that there is a beautiful harmony, because Christ departed\nfrom us, that his departure might be more useful to us than that presence,\nwhich, during his continuance on earth, confined itself within the humble\nmansion of his body. Therefore John, after having related that remarkable\ninvitation, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink,”\nsubjoins, that “the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was\nnot yet glorified.”(1321) This the Lord himself also declared to his\ndisciples: “It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away,\nthe Comforter will not come unto you.”(1322) Now, he proposes a\nconsolation for his corporeal absence, that he “will not leave them\ncomfortless, or orphans, but will come again to them,” in a manner\ninvisible indeed, but more desirable; because they were then taught by a\nmore certain experience that the authority which he enjoys, and the power\nwhich he exercises, is sufficient for the faithful, not only to procure\nthem a blessed life, but to insure them a happy death. And, indeed, we see\nhow largely he then increased the effusions of his Spirit, how greatly he\nadvanced the magnificence of his reign, and what superior power he exerted\nboth in assisting his friends, and in defeating his enemies. Being\nreceived up into heaven, therefore he removed his corporeal presence from\nour view; not that he might no longer be present with the faithful who\nwere still in a state of pilgrimage on earth, but that he might govern\nboth heaven and earth by a more efficacious energy. Moreover, his promise,\nthat he would be with us till the end of the world, he has performed by\nthis his ascension; by which, as his body was elevated above all heavens,\nso his power and energy have been diffused and extended beyond all the\nlimits of heaven and earth. In representing this, I would prefer the\nlanguage of Augustine to my own. “Christ,” says he, “was about to go by\ndeath to the right hand of the Father, whence he will hereafter come to\njudge the living and the dead; and this by a corporeal presence, according\nto the rule of faith and sound doctrine. For in his spiritual presence\nwith them, he was to come soon after his ascension.” And elsewhere he\ntreats this subject in a manner still more diffuse and explicit. By his\nineffable and invisible grace, Christ has fulfilled his declaration, “Lo,\nI am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”(1323) But with\nrespect to the body which the Word assumed, which was born of the Virgin,\nwhich was apprehended by the Jews, which was fixed to the cross, which was\ntaken down from the cross, which was folded in linen, which was laid in\nthe sepulchre, which was manifested at the resurrection, there has been an\naccomplishment of this prediction: “Ye shall not have me always with you.”\nWhy? Because in his corporeal presence he conversed with his disciples for\nforty days, and while they were attending him, seen but not followed by\nthem, he ascended into heaven; and he is not here, for he sits there at\nthe right hand of the Father; and yet he is here, for he has not withdrawn\nthe presence of his majesty. In the presence of his majesty, therefore, we\nhave Christ always with us; but with respect to his corporeal presence, he\nsaid with truth to his disciples, “Me ye have not always.” For the Church\nenjoyed his corporeal presence for a few days; now she enjoys him by\nfaith, and does not behold him with her eyes.\nXV. Wherefore it is immediately added, _that he is seated at the right\nhand of the Father_; which is a similitude borrowed from princes, who have\ntheir assistants, to whom they depute the exercise of the government. So\nChrist, in whom the Father determines to be exalted, and by whose medium\nhe chooses to reign, is said to have been received to his right hand; as\nthough it were said, that he had been inaugurated in the government of\nheaven and earth, and had solemnly entered on the actual administration of\nthe power committed to him; and not only that he has entered on it, but\nthat he continues in it, till he descends to judgment. For so the apostle\nexplains it, in the following words: “The Father hath set him at his own\nright hand, far above all principality, and power, and might, and\ndominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also\nin that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave\nhim to be the head over all things to the church,” &c.(1324) We see the\nend of this session; it is, that all creatures, both celestial and\nterrestrial, may admire his majesty, be governed by his hand, obey his\nwill, and be subject to his power. And the only design of the apostles in\ntheir frequent mention of it, is to teach us that all things are committed\nto his government. Wherefore they who suppose that nothing but blessedness\nis signified in this article, are not right in that opinion. It affects\nnot our argument, that Stephen declares that he sees Christ\n“standing,”(1325) because the present question relates, not to the posture\nof his body, but to the majesty of his dominion; so that _sitting_\nsignifies no other than presiding at the tribunal of heaven.\nXVI. Hence faith receives many advantages. For it perceives, that by his\nascension the Lord has opened the way to the kingdom of heaven, which had\nbeen stopped by Adam. For since he entered there in our nature, and as it\nwere in our names, it follows that, as the apostle expresses it, we now\n“sit together” with him “in heavenly places,”(1326) because we not only\nhope for heaven, but already possess it in our Head. Besides, faith knows\nthat his residence with his Father conduces greatly to our advantage. For\nbeing entered into a sanctuary, which is not of human erection,(1327) he\ncontinually appears in the presence of the Father as our advocate and\nintercessor;(1328) he attracts the eyes of the Father to his\nrighteousness, so as to avert them from our sins; he reconciles him to us,\nso as to procure for us, by his intercession, a way of access to his\nthrone, which he replenishes with grace and mercy, but which otherwise\nwould be pregnant with horror to miserable sinners.(1329) In the third\nplace, faith has an apprehension of his power, in which consists our\nstrength, our fortitude, our wealth, and our triumph over hell. For “when\nhe ascended up on high, he led captivity captive,”(1330) spoiled his\nenemies, and enriched his people, and daily loads them with spiritual\nfavours. He sits, therefore, on high, that from thence he may shed forth\nhis power upon us, that he may animate us with spiritual life, that he may\nsanctify us by his Spirit, that he may adorn his Church with a variety of\ngraces, and defend it by his protection from every calamity, that by the\nstrength of his hand he may restrain the ferocious enemies of his cross\nand of our salvation; finally, that he may retain all power in heaven and\nin earth; till he shall have overthrown all his enemies, who are also\nours, and completed the edification of his Church. And this is the true\nstate of his kingdom, this the power which the Father has conferred on\nhim, till he completes the last act by coming to judge the living and the\ndead.\nXVII. Christ gives his servants unequivocal tokens of the presence of his\npower; but because on earth his kingdom is in some measure concealed under\nthe meanness of the flesh, faith is, for a very good reason, called to\nmeditate on that visible presence which he will manifest at the last day.\nFor he will descend from heaven in a visible form, in the same manner in\nwhich he was seen to ascend;(1331) and will appear to all with the\nineffable majesty of his kingdom, with the splendour of immortality, with\nthe infinite power of Deity, and with a host of angels.(1332) From thence,\ntherefore, we are commanded to expect him as our Redeemer at the last day,\nwhen he will separate the sheep from the goats, the elect from the\nreprobate; and there will not be an individual of either the living or the\ndead that can escape his judgment. For from the most remote corners of the\nworld they will hear the sound of the trumpet, with which all mankind will\nbe summoned to his tribunal, both those whom that day shall find alive,\nand those whom death shall previously have removed from the society of the\nliving. There are some who understand the words _quick_, or _living, and\ndead_, in a different sense. And indeed we find that some of the fathers\nhesitated respecting the exposition of this clause; but the sense we have\ngiven, being plain and clear, is far more consistent with the design of\nthe Creed, which appears to have been composed for the common people. Nor\nis this repugnant to the assertion of the apostle, that “it is appointed\nunto men once to die.”(1333) For although they who shall survive in this\nmortal life till the last judgment, shall not die in a natural manner and\norder, yet that change, which they shall experience, since it will\nresemble death, may without impropriety be designated by that appellation.\nIt is certain indeed that “all shall not sleep, but all shall be\nchanged.”(1334) What is that? In one moment their mortal life will be\nextinguished and absorbed, and will be transformed into a nature entirely\nnew. This extinction of the flesh no man can deny to be death.\nNevertheless it remains a truth, that the living and the dead will be\nsummoned to judgment; for “the dead in Christ shall rise first: then they\nwhich are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\nclouds, to meet the Lord in the air.”(1335) And it is very probable that\nthis article was taken from the sermon of Peter,(1336) and from the solemn\ncharge of Paul to Timothy.(1337)\nXVIII. It is a source of peculiar consolation to hear that he will preside\nat the judgment, who has already destined us to participate with himself\nthe honour of sitting in judgment with him, so far will he be from\nascending the tribunal to condemn us. For how could a most merciful prince\ndestroy his own people? how could a head scatter his own members? how\ncould an advocate condemn his own clients? For if the apostle ventures to\nexclaim, that no one can condemn us while Christ intercedes for us,(1338)\nit is much more certain that Christ himself, our intercessor, will not\ncondemn those whose cause he has undertaken, and whom he has engaged to\nsupport. Indeed, it is no inconsiderable security, that we shall stand\nbefore no other tribunal than that of our Redeemer, from whom we are to\nexpect salvation; and that he, who by the gospel now promises eternal\nlife, will at the judgment ratify and perform the promise which he has\ngiven. The design of the Father in honouring the Son by “committing all\njudgment to him,”(1339) was, that he might relieve the consciences of his\npeople from all fear concerning the judgment. Thus far I have followed the\norder of the Apostles’ Creed; because, while it comprises, in a few words,\nthe principal points of redemption, it may serve to give us a distinct and\nseparate view of those particulars respecting Christ which merit our\nattention. I style it the Apostles’ Creed, but am not at all solicitous to\nknow who was the composer of it. The ancient writers agree in ascribing it\nto the apostles, either from a belief that it was written and published by\ntheir common concurrence, or from an opinion that this compendium, being\nfaithfully collected from the doctrine delivered by them, was worthy of\nbeing sanctioned by such a title. And whoever was the author of it, I have\nno doubt that it has been publicly and universally received as a\nconfession of faith from the first origin of the Church, and even from the\ndays of the apostles. Nor is it probable that it was composed by any\nprivate individual, since from time immemorial it has evidently been\nesteemed as of sacred authority by all the pious. But what we ought\nprincipally to regard, is beyond all controversy—that it comprehends a\ncomplete account of our faith in a concise and distinct order, and that\nevery thing it contains is confirmed by decisive testimonies of Scripture.\nThis being ascertained, it is of no use anxiously to inquire, or to\ncontend with any one, respecting its author, unless it be not sufficient\nfor any one to have the unerring truth of the Holy Spirit, without knowing\neither by whose mouth it was uttered, or by whose hand it was written.\nXIX. Since we see that the whole of our salvation, and all the branches of\nit, are comprehended in Christ, we must be cautious not to alienate from\nhim the least possible portion of it. If we seek salvation, we are taught\nby the name of JESUS, that it is in him; if we seek any other gifts of the\nSpirit, they will be found in his unction; strength, in his dominion;\npurity, in his conception; indulgence discovers itself in his nativity, by\nwhich he was made to resemble us in all things, that he might learn to\ncondole with us; if we seek redemption, it will be found in his passion;\nabsolution, in his condemnation; remission of the curse, in his cross;\nsatisfaction, in his sacrifice; purification, in his blood;\nreconciliation, in his descent into hell; mortification of the flesh, in\nhis sepulchre; newness of life and immortality, in his resurrection; the\ninheritance of the celestial kingdom, in his entrance into heaven;\nprotection, security, abundance, and enjoyment of all blessings, in his\nkingdom; a fearless expectation of the judgment, in the judicial authority\ncommitted to him. Finally, blessings of every kind are deposited in him;\nlet us draw from his treasury, and from no other source, till our desires\nare satisfied. For they who, not content with him alone, are carried\nhither and thither into a variety of hopes, although they fix their eyes\nprincipally on him, nevertheless deviate from the right way in the\ndiversion of any part of their attention to another quarter. This\ndistrust, however, cannot intrude, where the plenitude of his blessings\nhas once been truly known."

          "title": "Chapter XVII. Christ Truly And Properly Said To Have Merited The Grace Of",
          "content": "God And Salvation For Us.\nWe must devote an additional Chapter to the solution of this question. For\nthere are some men, more subtle than orthodox, who, though they confess\nthat Christ obtained salvation for us, yet cannot bear the word _merit_,\nby which they suppose the grace of God is obscured. So they maintain that\nChrist is only the instrument or minister, not, as he is called by Peter,\nthe Author, or Leader, and “Prince of life.”(1340) I grant, indeed, if any\nman would oppose Christ simply and alone to the judgment of God, there\nwould be no room for merit; because it is impossible to find in man any\nexcellence which can merit the favour of God; nay, as Augustine most truly\nobserves, “The brightest illustration of predestination and grace is the\nSaviour himself, the man Christ Jesus, who has acquired this character in\nhis human nature, without any previous merit either of works or of faith.\nLet any one tell me, how that man merited the honour of being assumed into\none person with the Word, who is coëternal with the Father, and so\nbecoming the only begotten Son of God. Thus the fountain of grace appears\nin our Head, and from him diffuses its streams through all his members\naccording to their respective capacities. Every one, from the commencement\nof his faith, is made a Christian, by the same grace, by which this man,\nfrom the commencement of his existence, was made the Christ.” Again, in\nanother treatise, Augustine says, “There is not a more illustrious example\nof predestination than the Mediator himself. For he who made of the seed\nof David this righteous man, so that he never was unrighteous, without any\nprevious merit of his will, converts unrighteous persons into righteous\nones, and makes them members of that Head,” &c. When we speak of the merit\nof Christ, therefore, we do not consider him as the origin of it, but we\nascend to the ordination of God, which is the first cause; because it was\nof his mere good pleasure, that God appointed him Mediator to procure\nsalvation for us. And thus it betrays ignorance to oppose the merit of\nChrist to the mercy of God. For it is a common maxim, that between two\nthings, of which one succeeds or is subordinate to the other, there can be\nno opposition. There is no reason, therefore, why the justification of men\nshould not be gratuitous from the mere mercy of God, and why at the same\ntime the merit of Christ should not intervene, which is subservient to the\nmercy of God. But to our works are directly and equally opposed the\ngratuitous favour of God and the obedience of Christ, each in its\nrespective place. For Christ could merit nothing except by the good\npleasure of God, by which he had been predestinated to appease the Divine\nwrath by his sacrifice, and to abolish our transgressions by his\nobedience. To conclude, since the merit of Christ depends solely on the\ngrace of God, which appointed this method of salvation for us, therefore\nhis merit and that grace are with equal propriety opposed to all the\nrighteousnesses of men.\nII. This distinction is gathered from numerous passages of Scripture. “God\nso loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever\nbelieveth in him should not perish.”(1341) We see that the love of God\nholds the first place, as the supreme and original cause, and that faith\nin Christ follows as the second and proximate cause. If it be objected,\nthat Christ is only the formal cause, this diminishes his merit more than\nthe words now quoted will bear. For if we obtain righteousness by a faith\nwhich relies on him, it is in him we are to seek the cause of our\nsalvation. This is evident from many passages. “Not that we loved God, but\nthat he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our\nsins.”(1342) These words clearly demonstrate, that to remove every\nobstacle in the way of his love towards us, God appointed a method of\nreconciliation in Christ. And there is much contained in the word\n“propitiation;” for God, in a certain ineffable manner, at the same time\nthat he loved us, was nevertheless angry with us, till he was reconciled\nin Christ. This is implied in the following passages: “He is the\npropitiation for our sins.”(1343) Again: “It pleased the Father, having\nmade peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things\nunto himself.”(1344) Again: “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto\nhimself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.”(1345) Again: “He hath\nmade us accepted in the Beloved.”(1346) Again: “That he might reconcile\nboth unto God in one body by the cross.”(1347) The reason of this mystery\nmay be learned from the first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians,\nwhere Paul, having taught that we are chosen in Christ, adds at the same\ntime, that we are accepted in him. How did God begin to favour those whom\nhe had loved before the creation of the world, but by the manifestation\nwhich he made of his love when he was reconciled by the blood of Christ?\nFor since God is the fountain of all righteousness, he must necessarily be\nthe enemy and judge of every sinner. Wherefore the beginning of his love\nis the righteousness described by Paul: “He hath made him to be sin for\nus, who knew no sin; that we may be made the righteousness of God in\nhim.”(1348) For his meaning is, that by the sacrifice of Christ we obtain\ngratuitous righteousness, so as to be acceptable to God, though by nature\nwe are the children of wrath, and alienated from him by sin. This\ndistinction is indicated also wherever the grace of Christ is connected\nwith the love of God; whence it follows that our Saviour bestows on us\nwhat he has purchased; for otherwise it would be inconsistent to ascribe\nthis praise to him distinctly from the Father, that grace is his, and\nproceeds from him.\nIII. Now, that Christ by his obedience has really procured and merited\ngrace from the Father for us, is certainly and justly concluded from\nvarious passages of Scripture. For I assume this as granted: if Christ has\nsatisfied for our sins; if he has sustained the punishment due to us; if\nhe has appeased God by his obedience; in a word, if he has suffered, the\njust for the unjust,—then salvation has been obtained for us by his\nrighteousness, which is the same as being merited. But according to the\ntestimony of Paul, “We were reconciled by his death, by whom we have\nreceived the atonement,” or reconciliation.(1349) Now, there is no room\nfor reconciliation without a previous offence. The sense therefore is,\nthat God, to whom our sins had rendered us odious, has been appeased by\nthe death of his Son, so as to be propitious to us. And the antithesis,\nwhich follows just after, is worthy of careful observation: “As by one\nman’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one\nshall many be made righteous.”(1350) For the meaning is, that as by the\nsin of Adam we were alienated from God and devoted to destruction, so by\nthe obedience of Christ we are received into favour, as righteous persons.\nNor does the future tense of the verb exclude present righteousness; as\nappears from the context. For he had before said, “The free gift is of\nmany offences unto justification.”(1351)\nIV. But when we say that grace is procured for us by the merit of Christ,\nwe intend, that we have been purified by his blood, and that his death was\nan expiation for sins. “The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all\nsin.”(1352) “This blood is shed for the remission of sins.”(1353) If the\nnon‐imputation of our sins to us be the effect of the blood which he shed,\nit follows that this was the price of satisfaction to the justice of God.\nThis is confirmed by the declaration of the Baptist: “Behold the Lamb of\nGod, which taketh away the sin of the world.”(1354) For he opposes Christ\nto all the sacrifices of the law, to show that what they prefigured was\naccomplished in him alone. Now we know what Moses frequently says—that an\natonement shall be made for sin, and it shall be forgiven. In short, the\nancient figures give us a fine exhibition of the power and efficacy of the\ndeath of Christ. And the apostle copiously discusses this subject in the\nEpistle to the Hebrews, judiciously assuming this as a fundamental\nprinciple, that “without shedding of blood there is no remission.” Whence\nhe infers, that Christ has “once appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice\nof himself;” and that “he was offered to bear the sins of many.”(1355) He\nhad already said, that “Not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his\nown blood; he entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal\nredemption.”(1356) Now, when he argues in this manner, “If the blood of\nbulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean,\nsanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood\nof Christ purge your conscience from dead works!”(1357) it evidently\nappears that we too much undervalue the grace of Christ, unless we\nattribute to his sacrifice an expiatory, placatory, and satisfactory\nefficacy. Therefore it is immediately added, “He is the mediator of the\nNew Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the\ntransgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called\nmight receive the promise of eternal inheritance.”(1358) But we ought\nparticularly to consider the relation described by Paul, that he was “made\na curse for us.”(1359) For it would be unnecessary, and consequently\nabsurd, for Christ to be loaded with a curse, except in order to discharge\nthe debts due from others, and thereby to obtain a righteousness for them.\nThe testimony of Isaiah likewise is clear, that “the chastisement of our\npeace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”(1360) For if\nChrist had not made a satisfaction for our sins, he could not be said to\nhave appeased God by suffering the punishment to which we were exposed.\nThis is confirmed by a subsequent clause: “For the transgression of my\npeople was he stricken.”(1361) Let us add the interpretation of Peter,\nwhich will remove all difficulty, that “he bare our sins in his own body\non the tree;”(1362) which imports that the burden of condemnation, from\nwhich we have been relieved, was laid upon Christ.\nV. The apostles explicitly declare, that he paid a price to redeem us from\nthe sentence of death: “Being justified freely by his grace, through the\nredemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath set forth to be a\npropitiation, through faith in his blood.”(1363) Here Paul celebrates the\ngrace of God, because he has given the price of our redemption in the\ndeath of Christ; and then enjoins us to betake ourselves to his blood,\nthat we may obtain righteousness, and may stand secure before the judgment\nof God. Peter confirms the same when he says, “Ye were not redeemed with\ncorruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of\nChrist, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.”(1364) For there\nwould be no propriety in the comparison, unless this blood had been the\nprice of satisfaction for sin; for which reason Paul says, “Ye are bought\nwith a price.”(1365) Nor would there be any truth in his other assertion,\nthat “there is one Mediator, who gave himself a ransom,”(1366) unless the\npunishment due to our demerits had been transferred to him. Therefore the\nsame apostle defines “redemption through his blood” to be “the forgiveness\nof sins;”(1367) as though he had said, We are justified or acquitted\nbefore God, because that blood is a complete satisfaction for us. This is\nconsonant with the following passage, that “he blotted out the hand‐\nwriting, which was contrary to us, nailing it to his cross.”(1368) For\nthese words signify the payment or compensation which absolves us from\nguilt. There is great weight also in these words of Paul: “If\nrighteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.”(1369) For\nhence we conclude, that we must seek from Christ what the law would confer\nupon any one who fulfilled it; or, which is the same, that we obtain by\nthe grace of Christ what God promised in the law to our works; “which”\ncommandments “if a man do, he shall live in them.”(1370) This the apostle\nconfirms with equal perspicuity in his sermon at Antioch, asserting that\n“by Christ all that believe are justified from all things, from which they\ncould not be justified by the law of Moses.”(1371) For if righteousness\nconsist in an observance of the law, who can deny that Christ merited\nfavour for us, when, by bearing this burden himself, he reconciles us to\nGod, just as though we were complete observers of the law ourselves? The\nsame idea is conveyed in what he afterwards writes to the Galatians, that\n“God sent forth his Son, made under the law, to redeem them that were\nunder the law.”(1372) For what was the design of that subjection to the\nlaw, but to procure a righteousness for us, by undertaking to perform that\nwhich we were not able to do? Hence that imputation of righteousness\nwithout works, of which Paul treats;(1373) because that righteousness\nwhich is found in Christ alone is accepted as ours. Nor indeed is the\n“flesh” of Christ called our “food”(1374) for any other reason but because\nwe find in it the substance of life. Now, this virtue proceeds solely from\nthe crucifixion of the Son of God, as the price of our righteousness. Thus\nPaul says, “Christ hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice\nto God for a sweet‐smelling savour.”(1375) And in another place, “He was\ndelivered for our offences, and was raised again for our\njustification.”(1376) Hence it is inferred, not only that salvation is\ngiven us through Christ, but that the Father is now propitious to us for\nhis sake. For it cannot be doubted, but this, which God declares in a\nfigurative way by Isaiah, is perfectly fulfilled in him: “I will” do it\n“for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.”(1377) Of this the\napostle is a sufficient witness, when he says, “Your sins are forgiven you\nfor his name’s sake.”(1378) For although the name of Christ is not\nexpressed, yet John, in his usual manner, designates him by the pronoun\nαὐτος, _he_. In this sense the Lord declares, “As I live by the Father, so\nhe that eateth me, even he shall live by me.”(1379) With which corresponds\nthe following declaration of Paul: “Unto you it is given for the love of\nChrist (ὑπερ Χριστου) not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for\nhis sake.”(1380)\nVI. But the inquiry made by Lombard and the schoolmen, whether Christ\nmerited for himself, discovers as much foolish curiosity, as the assertion\ndoes presumption when they affirm it. For what necessity was there for the\nonly begotten Son of God to descend, in order to make any new acquisition\nfor himself? And God by the publication of his own counsel removes every\ndoubt. For it is said, not that the Father consulted the benefit of the\nSon in his merits, but that he “delivered him to death, and spared him\nnot,”(1381) “because he loved the world.”(1382) And the language of the\nprophets is worthy of observation: “Unto us a Child is born.”(1383) Again:\n“Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; behold, thy King cometh unto\nthee.”(1384) There would otherwise be no force in that confirmation of his\nlove, which Paul celebrates, that he “died for us, while we were\nenemies.”(1385) For we infer from this, that he had no regard to himself;\nand this he clearly affirms himself, when he says, “For their sakes I\nsanctify myself.”(1386) For by transferring the benefit of his sanctity to\nothers, he declares that he makes no acquisition for himself. And it is\nhighly worthy of our observation, that in order to devote himself wholly\nto our salvation, Christ in a manner forgot himself. To support this\nnotion of theirs, the schoolmen preposterously pervert the following\npassage of Paul: “Wherefore also God hath highly exalted him, and given\nhim a name which is above every name.”(1387) For, considered as a man, by\nwhat merits could he obtain such dignity as to be the Judge of the world\nand the Head of angels, to enjoy the supreme dominion of God, and to be\nthe residence of that majesty, the thousandth part of which can never be\napproached by all the abilities of men and of angels? But the solution is\neasy and complete, that Paul, in that passage, is not treating of the\ncause of the exaltation of Christ, but only showing the consequence of it,\nthat he might be an example to us; nor did he mean any other than what is\ndeclared in another place, that “Christ ought to have suffered, and to\nenter into his glory.”(1388)"

          "content": "The Secret Operation Of The Spirit.\nWe are now to examine how we obtain the enjoyment of those blessings which\nthe Father has conferred on his only begotten Son, not for his own private\nuse, but to enrich the poor and needy. And first it must be remarked, that\nas long as there is a separation between Christ and us, all that he\nsuffered and performed for the salvation of mankind is useless and\nunavailing to us. To communicate to us what he received from his Father,\nhe must, therefore, become ours, and dwell within us. On this account he\nis called our “Head,”(1389) and “the first‐born among many\nbrethren;”(1390) and we, on the other hand, are said to be “grafted into\nhim,”(1391) and to “put him on;”(1392) for, as I have observed, whatever\nhe possesses is nothing to us, till we are united to him. But though it be\ntrue that we obtain this by faith, yet, since we see that the\ncommunication of Christ, offered in the gospel, is not promiscuously\nembraced by all, reason itself teaches us to proceed further, and to\ninquire into the secret energy of the Spirit, by which we are introduced\nto the enjoyment of Christ and all his benefits. I have already treated of\nthe eternal Deity and essence of the Spirit; let us now confine ourselves\nto this particular point: Christ came thus by water and blood, that the\nSpirit may testify concerning him, in order that the salvation procured by\nhim may not be lost to us. For as “there are three that bear record in\nheaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit,” so also “there are three on\nearth, the spirit, the water, and the blood.”(1393) Nor is this a useless\nrepetition of the testimony of the Spirit, which we perceive to be\nengraven like a seal on our hearts, so that it seals the ablution and\nsacrifice of Christ. For which reason Peter also says, that believers are\n“elect through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling\nof the blood of Jesus Christ.”(1394) This passage suggests to us, that our\nsouls are purified by the secret ablution of the Spirit, that the effusion\nof that sacred blood may not be in vain. For the same reason also Paul,\nwhen speaking of purification and justification, says, we enjoy both “in\nthe name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”(1395) The sum\nof all is this—that the Holy Spirit is the bond by which Christ\nefficaciously unites us to himself. And what we have advanced in the last\nbook concerning his unction, tends to establish the same truth.\nII. But as a further confirmation of this point, which is highly worthy of\nbeing understood, we must remember that Christ was endued with the Holy\nSpirit in a peculiar manner; in order to separate us from the world, and\nintroduce us into the hope of an eternal inheritance. Hence the Spirit is\ncalled “the Spirit of holiness;”(1396) not only because he animates and\nsupports us by that general power which is displayed in mankind, and in\nall other creatures, but because he is the seed and root of a heavenly\nlife within us. The principal topic, therefore, dwelt on by the prophets\nin celebrating the kingdom of Christ, is, that there would then be a more\nexuberant effusion of the Spirit. The most remarkable passage is that of\nJoel: “I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh in those days.”(1397) For,\nthough the prophet seems to restrict the gifts of the Spirit to the\nexercise of the prophetic function, yet he signifies, in a figurative way,\nthat God, by the illumination of his Spirit, will make those his\ndisciples, who before were total strangers to the heavenly doctrine.\nBesides, as God the Father gives us his Holy Spirit for the sake of his\nSon, and yet has deposited “all fulness” with his Son, that he might be\nthe minister and dispenser of his own goodness,—the Holy Spirit is\nsometimes called the Spirit of the Father, and sometimes the Spirit of the\nSon. “Ye (says Paul) are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be\nthat the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now, if any man have not the Spirit\nof Christ, he is none of his.”(1398) And thence he inspires a hope of\ncomplete renovation, for “he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall\nalso quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”(1399)\nFor there is no absurdity in ascribing to the Father the praise of his own\ngifts, of which he is the author; and also ascribing the same glory to\nChrist, with whom the gifts of the Spirit are deposited, to be given to\nhis people. Therefore he invites all who thirst to come to him and\ndrink.(1400) And Paul teaches us, that “unto every one of us is given\ngrace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.”(1401) And it must\nbe remarked, that he is called the Spirit of Christ, not only because the\neternal Word of God is united with the same Spirit as the Father, but also\nwith respect to his character of Mediator; for, if he had not been endued\nwith this power, his advent to us would have been altogether in vain. In\nwhich sense he is called “the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, a\nquickening Spirit;”(1402) where Paul compares the peculiar life with which\nthe Son of God inspires his people, that they may be one with him, to that\nanimal life which is equally common to the reprobate. So, where he wishes\nto the faithful “the grace of Christ, and the love of God,” he adds also\n“the communion of the Spirit,”(1403) without which there can be no\nenjoyment of the paternal favour of God, or the beneficence of Christ. As\nhe says also in another place, “the love of God is shed abroad in our\nhearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.”(1404)\nIII. And here it will be proper to notice the titles by which the\nScripture distinguishes the Spirit, where it treats of the commencement,\nprogress, and completion of our salvation. First, he is called the “Spirit\nof adoption,”(1405) because he witnesses to us the gratuitous benevolence\nof God, with which God the Father has embraced us in his beloved and only\nbegotten Son, that he might be a father to us; and animates us to pray\nwith confidence, and even dictates expressions, so that we may boldly cry,\n“Abba, Father.” For the same reason, he is said to be “the earnest” and\n“seal” of our inheritance; because, while we are pilgrims and strangers in\nthe world, and as persons dead, he infuses into us such life from heaven,\nthat we are certain of our salvation being secured by the Divine\nfaithfulness and care.(1406) Whence he is also said to be “life,” because\nof righteousness.(1407) Since by his secret showers he makes us fertile in\nproducing the fruits of righteousness, he is frequently called “water;” as\nin Isaiah: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.”(1408)\nAgain: “I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the\ndry ground.”(1409) To which corresponds the invitation of Christ, just\nquoted: “If any man thirst, let him come unto me.”(1410) He sometimes,\nhowever, receives this appellation from his purifying and cleansing\nenergy; as in Ezekiel, where the Lord promises to sprinkle clean water on\nhis people, to cleanse them from their impurities.(1411) Because he\nrestores to life and vigour, and continually supports, those whom he has\nanointed with the oil of his grape, he thence obtains the name of\n“unction.”(1412) Because he daily consumes the vices of our concupiscence,\nand inflames our hearts with the love of God and the pursuit of\npiety,—from these effects he is justly called “fire.”(1413) Lastly, he is\ndescribed to us as a “fountain,” whence we receive all the emanation of\nheavenly riches; and as “the hand of God,” by which he exerts his power;\nbecause by the breath of his power he inspires us with Divine life, so\nthat we are not now actuated from ourselves, but directed by his agency\nand influence; so that if there be any good in us, it is the fruit of his\ngrace, whereas our characters without him are darkness of mind and\nperverseness of heart. It has, indeed, already been clearly stated, that\ntill our minds are fixed on the Spirit, Christ remains of no value to us;\nbecause we look at him as an object of cold speculation without us, and\ntherefore at a great distance from us. But we know that he benefits none\nbut those who have him for their “head” and “elder brother,” and who have\n“put him on.”(1414) This union alone renders his advent in the character\nof a Saviour available to us. We learn the same truth from that sacred\nmarriage, by which we are made flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone,\nand therefore one with him.(1415) It is only by his Spirit that he unites\nhimself with us; and by the grace and power of the same Spirit we are made\nhis members; that he may keep us under himself, and we may mutually enjoy\nhim.\nIV. But faith, being his principal work, is the object principally\nreferred to in the most frequent expressions of his power and operation;\nbecause it is the only medium by which he leads us into the light of the\ngospel; according to the declaration of John, that “Christ gave power (or\nprivilege) to become the sons of God to them that believed on his name;\nwhich were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the\nwill of man, but of God;”(1416) where, opposing God to flesh and blood, he\nasserts the reception of Christ by faith, by those who would otherwise\nremain unbelievers, to be a supernatural gift. Similar to which is this\nanswer of Christ: “Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my\nFather, which is in heaven;”(1417) which I now merely mention because I\nhave elsewhere treated it at large. Similar also is the assertion of Paul,\nthat the Ephesians “were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.”(1418)\nFor this shows, that there is an eternal teacher, by whose agency the\npromise of salvation, which otherwise would only strike the air, or at\nmost our ears, penetrates into our minds. Similar also is his remark, that\nthe Thessalonians were “chosen by God through sanctification of the\nSpirit, and belief of the truth;”(1419) by which connection, he briefly\nsuggests, that faith itself proceeds only from the Spirit. John expresses\nthis in plainer terms: “We know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which\nhe hath given us.”(1420) Again: “Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and\nhe in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.”(1421) Therefore Christ\npromised to send to his disciples “the Spirit of truth, whom the world\ncannot receive,”(1422) that they might be capable of attaining heavenly\nwisdom. He ascribes to him the peculiar office of suggesting to their\nminds all the oral instructions which he had given them. For in vain would\nthe light present itself to the blind, unless this Spirit of understanding\nwould open their mental eyes; so that he may be justly called the key with\nwhich the treasures of the kingdom of heaven are unlocked to us; and his\nillumination constitutes our mental eyes to behold them. It is therefore\nthat Paul so highly commends the ministry of the Spirit;(1423) because the\ninstructions of preachers would produce no benefit, did not Christ\nhimself, the internal teacher, by his Spirit, draw to him those who were\ngiven him by the Father.(1424) Therefore, as we have stated, that complete\nsalvation is found in the person of Christ, so, to make us partakers of\nit, he “baptizes us with the Holy Spirit and with fire,”(1425)\nenlightening us into the faith of his Gospel, regenerating us so that we\nbecome new creatures, and, purging us from profane impurities, consecrates\nus as holy temples to God."

          "title": "Chapter II. Faith Defined, And Its Properties Described.",
          "content": "All these things will be easily understood when we have given a clearer\ndefinition of faith, that the reader may perceive its nature and\nimportance. But it will be proper to recall to his remembrance, what has\nbeen already stated; that God has given us his law as the rule of our\nconduct, and that, if we are guilty of even the smallest breach of it, we\nare exposed to the dreadful punishment of eternal death, which he\ndenounces. Again, that since it is not only difficult, but entirely above\nour strength, and beyond the utmost extent of our ability, to fulfil the\nlaw as he requires,—if we only view ourselves, and consider what we have\ndemerited, we have not the least hope left, but, as persons rejected by\nGod, are on the verge of eternal perdition. In the third place, it has\nbeen explained, that there is but one method of deliverance, by which we\ncan be extricated from such a direful calamity; that is, the appearance of\nChrist the Redeemer, by whose means our heavenly Father, commiserating us\nin his infinite goodness and mercy, has been pleased to relieve us, if we\nembrace this mercy with a sincere faith, and rely on it with a constant\nhope. But we must now examine the nature of this faith, by which all who\nare the adopted sons of God enter on the possession of the heavenly\nkingdom; since it is certain, that not every opinion, nor even every\npersuasion, is equal to the accomplishment of so great a work. And we\nought to be the more cautious and diligent in our meditations and\ninquiries on the genuine property of faith, in proportion to the\npernicious tendency of the mistakes of multitudes in the present age on\nthis subject. For a great part of the world, when they hear the word\n_faith_, conceive it to be nothing more than a common assent to the\nevangelical history. And even the disputes of the schools concerning\nfaith, by simply styling God the object of it, (as I have elsewhere\nobserved,) rather mislead miserable souls by a vain speculation, than\ndirect them to the proper mark. For, since God “dwelleth in the light,\nwhich no man can approach unto,”(1426) there is a necessity for the\ninterposition of Christ, as the medium of access to him. Whence he calls\nhimself “the light of the world,”(1427) and in another place, “the way,\nand the truth, and the life;” because “no man cometh unto the Father,” who\nis the fountain of life, “but by him;”(1428) because he alone knows the\nFather, and reveals him to believers.(1429)\nFor this reason Paul asserts, that he esteemed nothing worthy of being\nknown but Jesus Christ;(1430) and in the twentieth chapter of the Acts\ndeclares, that he had preached faith in Christ; and in another place, he\nintroduces Christ speaking in the following manner: “I send thee unto the\nGentiles, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among\nthem which are sanctified by faith, that is in me.”(1431) This apostle\ntells us, that the glory of God is visible to us in his person, or (which\nconveys the same idea) that “the light of the knowledge of the glory of\nGod” shines “in his face.”(1432) It is true, that faith relates to the one\nGod; but there must also be added a knowledge of Jesus Christ, whom he has\nsent.(1433) For God himself would be altogether concealed from us, if we\nwere not illuminated by the brightness of Christ. For this purpose the\nFather has deposited all his treasures with his only begotten Son, that he\nmight reveal himself in him; and that, by such a communication of\nblessings, he might express a true image of his glory. For as it has been\nobserved, that we require to be drawn by the Spirit, that we may be\nexcited to seek Christ, so we should also be apprized, that the invisible\nFather is to be sought only in this image. On which subject, Augustine,\ntreating of the object of faith, beautifully remarks, “that we ought to\nknow whither we should go, and in what way;” and immediately after he\nconcludes, “that he who unites Deity and humanity in one person, is the\nway most secure from all errors; for that it is God towards whom we tend,\nand man by whom we go; but that both together can be found only in\nChrist.” Nor does Paul, when he speaks of faith in God, intend to subvert\nwhat he so frequently inculcates concerning faith, whose stability is\nwholly in Christ. And Peter most suitably connects them together, when he\nsays, that “by him we believe in God.”(1434)\nII. This evil, then, as well as innumerable others, must be imputed to the\nschoolmen, who have, as it were, concealed Christ, by drawing a veil over\nhim; whereas, unless our views be immediately and steadily directed to\nhim, we shall always be wandering through labyrinths without end. They not\nonly, by their obscure definition, diminish, and almost annihilate, all\nthe importance of faith, but have fabricated the notion of implicit faith,\na term with which they have honoured the grossest ignorance, and most\nperniciously deluded the miserable multitude. Indeed, to express the fact\nmore truly and plainly, this notion has not only buried the true faith in\noblivion, but has entirely destroyed it. Is this faith—to understand\nnothing, but obediently to submit our understanding to the Church? Faith\nconsists not in ignorance, but in knowledge; and that not only of God, but\nalso of the Divine will. For we do not obtain salvation by our promptitude\nto embrace as truth whatever the Church may have prescribed, or by our\ntransferring to her the province of inquiry and of knowledge. But when we\nknow God to be a propitious Father to us, through the reconciliation\neffected by Christ, and that Christ is given to us for righteousness,\nsanctification, and life,—by this knowledge, I say, not by renouncing our\nunderstanding, we obtain an entrance into the kingdom of heaven. For, when\nthe apostle says, that “with the heart man believeth unto righteousness,\nand with the mouth confession is made unto salvation,”(1435) he indicates,\nthat it is not sufficient for a man implicitly to credit what he neither\nunderstands, nor even examines; but he requires an explicit knowledge of\nthe Divine goodness, in which our righteousness consists.\nIII. I do not deny (such is the ignorance with which we are enveloped)\nthat many things are very obscure to us at present, and will continue to\nbe so, till we shall have cast off the burden of the flesh, and arrived\nnearer to the presence of God. On such subjects, nothing would be more\nproper than a suspension of judgment, and a firm resolution to maintain\nunity with the Church. But that ignorance combined with humility should,\nunder this pretext, be dignified with the appellation of Faith, is\nextremely absurd. For faith consists in a knowledge of God and of\nChrist,(1436) not in reverence for the Church. And we see what a labyrinth\nthey have fabricated by this notion of theirs, so that the ignorant and\ninexperienced, without any discrimination, eagerly embrace as oracular\nevery thing obtruded upon them under the name of the Church; sometimes\neven the most monstrous errors. This inconsiderate credulity, though it be\nthe certain precipice of ruin, is, nevertheless, excused by them on the\nplea that it credits nothing definitively, but with this condition\nannexed, if such be the faith of the Church. Thus they pretend that truth\nis held in error, light in darkness, and true knowledge in ignorance. But,\nnot to occupy any more time in refuting them, we only admonish the reader\nto compare their doctrine with ours; for the perspicuity of the truth will\nof itself furnish a sufficient refutation. For the question with them is\nnot, whether faith be yet involved in many relics of ignorance, but they\npositively assert, that persons are possessed of true faith, who are\ncharmed with their ignorance, and even indulge it, provided they assent to\nthe authority and judgment of the Church concerning things unknown; as if\nthe Scripture did not universally inculcate that knowledge is united with\nfaith.\nIV. We grant, that during our pilgrimage in the world, our faith is\nimplicit, not only because many things are yet hidden from our view, but\nbecause our knowledge of every thing is very imperfect, in consequence of\nthe clouds of error by which we are surrounded. For the greatest wisdom of\nthose who are most perfect, is to improve, and to press forward with\npatient docility. Therefore Paul exhorts the faithful, if they differ from\neach other on any subject, to wait for further revelation.(1437) And\nexperience teaches us, that till we are divested of the flesh, our\nknowledge falls far short of what might be wished; in reading also, many\nobscure passages daily occur, which convince us of our ignorance. With\nthis barrier God restrains us within the bounds of modesty, assigning to\nevery one a measure of faith, that even the most learned teacher may be\nready to learn. We may observe eminent examples of this implicit faith in\nthe disciples of Christ, before they were fully enlightened. We see with\nwhat difficulty they imbibed the first rudiments; how they hesitated even\nat the most minute particulars; what inconsiderable advances they made\neven while hanging on the lips of their Master; and when they ran to the\ngrave at the intelligence of the women, his resurrection was like a dream\nto them. The testimony already borne by Christ to their possession of\nfaith, forbids us to say that they were entirely destitute of it; indeed,\nif they had not been persuaded that Christ would rise from the dead, they\nwould have felt no further concern about him. The women were not induced\nby superstition to embalm with spices the body of a deceased man, of whose\nlife there was no hope; but though they credited his declarations, whose\nveracity they well knew, yet the ignorance, which still occupied their\nminds, involved their faith in darkness, so that they were almost lost in\nastonishment. Whence also they are said at length to have believed, when\nthey saw the words of Christ verified by facts; not that their faith then\ncommenced, but the seed of faith, which had been latent, and as it were\ndead in their hearts, then shot forth with additional vigour. They had\ntherefore a true but an implicit faith, because they received Christ with\nreverence as their only teacher: being taught by him, they were persuaded\nthat he was the author of their salvation; and they believed that he came\nfrom heaven, that through the grace of the Father he might assemble all\nhis disciples there. But we need not seek a more familiar proof of this\npoint, than that some portion of unbelief is always mixed with faith in\nevery Christian.\nV. We may also style that an implicit faith, which in strict propriety is\nnothing but a preparation for faith. The evangelists relate that many\nbelieved, who, only being filled with admiration at the miracles of\nChrist, proceeded no further than a persuasion that he was the promised\nMessiah, although they had little or no knowledge of evangelical doctrine.\nSuch reverence, which induced them cheerfully to submit themselves to\nChrist, is dignified with the title of faith, of which, however, it was\nmerely the commencement. Thus the nobleman, or courtier, who believed the\npromise of Christ concerning the healing of his son, when he returned to\nhis house,(1438) according to the testimony of the evangelist, believed\nagain; that is, first he esteemed as an oracle what he had heard from the\nlips of Christ; but afterwards he devoted himself to his authority to\nreceive his doctrine. It must be understood, however, that he was docile\nand ready to learn; that the word _believe_, in the first place, denotes a\nparticular faith; but in the second place, it numbers him among the\ndisciples who had given their names to Christ. John gives us a similar\nexample in the Samaritans, who believed the report of the woman, so as to\nrun with eagerness to Christ; but who, after having heard him, said to the\nwoman, “Now we believe, not because of thy saying; for we have heard him\nourselves, and know, that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the\nworld.”(1439) Hence it appears, that persons not yet initiated into the\nfirst elements, but only inclined to obedience, are called believers; not,\nindeed, with strict propriety, but because God, in his goodness,\ndistinguishes that pious disposition with such a great honour. But this\ndocility, connected with a desire of improvement, is very remote from that\ngross ignorance which stupefies those who are content with such an\nimplicit faith as the Papists have invented. For if Paul severely condemns\nthose who are “ever learning, yet never come to the knowledge of the\ntruth,”(1440) how much greater ignominy do they deserve who make it their\nstudy to know nothing!\nVI. This, then, is the true knowledge of Christ—to receive him as he is\noffered by the Father, that is, invested with his gospel; for, as he is\nappointed to be the object of our faith, so we cannot advance in the right\nway to him, without the guidance of the gospel. The gospel certainly opens\nto us those treasures of grace, without which Christ would profit us\nlittle. Thus Paul connects faith as an inseparable concomitant with\ndoctrine, where he says, “Ye have not so learned Christ; if so be ye have\nbeen taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus.”(1441) Yet I do not so far\nrestrict faith to the gospel, but that I admit Moses and the prophets to\nhave delivered what was sufficient for its establishment; but because the\ngospel exhibits a fuller manifestation of Christ, it is justly styled by\nPaul, “the words of faith and of good doctrine.”(1442) For the same\nreason, in another place, he represents the law as abolished by the coming\nof faith;(1443) comprehending under this term the new kind of teaching, by\nwhich Christ, since his appearance as our Master, has given a brighter\ndisplay of the mercy of the Father, and a more explicit testimony\nconcerning our salvation. The more easy and convenient method for us will\nbe, to descend regularly from the genus to the species. In the first\nplace, we must be apprized, that faith has a perpetual relation to the\nword, and can no more be separated from it, than the rays from the sun,\nwhence they proceed. Therefore God proclaims by Isaiah, “Hear, and your\nsouls shall live.”(1444) And that the word is the fountain of faith, is\nevident from this language of John: “These are written, that ye might\nbelieve.”(1445) The Psalmist also, intending to exhort the people to\nfaith, says, “To‐day, if ye will hear his voice;”(1446) and to hear,\ngenerally means to believe. Lastly, it is not without reason that in\nIsaiah, God distinguishes the children of the Church from strangers, by\nthis character, that they shall all be his disciples, and be taught by\nhim;(1447) for, if this were a benefit common to all, why should he\naddress himself to a few? Correspondent with this is the general use of\nthe words “believers,” and “disciples,” as synonymous, by the evangelists,\non all occasions, and by Luke in particular, very frequently in the Acts\nof the Apostles; in the ninth chapter of which, he extends the latter\nepithet even to a woman. Wherefore, if faith decline in the smallest\ndegree from this object, towards which it ought to be directed, it no\nlonger retains its own nature, but becomes an uncertain credulity, and an\nerroneous excursion of the mind. The same Divine word is the foundation by\nwhich faith is sustained and supported, from which it cannot be moved\nwithout an immediate downfall. Take away the word, then, and there will be\nno faith left. We are not here disputing whether the ministry of men be\nnecessary to disseminate the word of God, by which faith is produced,\nwhich we shall discuss in another place; but we assert, that the word\nitself, however it may be conveyed to us, is like a mirror, in which faith\nmay behold God. Whether, therefore, God in this instance use the agency of\nmen, or whether he operate solely by his own power, he always discovers\nhimself by his word to those whom he designs to draw to himself.(1448)\nWhence Paul defines faith as an obedience rendered to the gospel, and\npraises the service of faith.(1449) For the apprehension of faith is not\nconfined to our knowing that there is a God, but chiefly consists in our\nunderstanding what is his disposition towards us. For it is not of so much\nimportance to us to know what he is in himself, as what he is willing to\nbe to us. We find, therefore, that faith is a knowledge of the will of God\nrespecting us, received from his word. And the foundation of this is a\nprevious persuasion of the Divine veracity; any doubt of which being\nentertained in the mind, the authority of the word will be dubious and\nweak, or rather it will be of no authority at all. Nor is it sufficient to\nbelieve that the veracity of God is incapable of deception or falsehood,\nunless you also admit, as beyond all doubt, that whatever proceeds from\nhim is sacred and inviolable truth.\nVII. But as the human heart is not excited to faith by every word of God,\nwe must further inquire what part of the word it is, with which faith is\nparticularly concerned. God declared to Adam, “Thou shalt surely\ndie;”(1450) and to Cain, “The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me\nfrom the ground;”(1451) but these declarations are so far from being\nadapted to the establishment of faith, that of themselves they can only\nshake it. We do not deny that it is the office of faith to subscribe to\nthe truth of God, whatever be the time, the nature, or the manner of his\ncommunications; but our present inquiry is only, what faith finds in the\nDivine word, upon which to rest its dependence and confidence. When our\nconscience beholds nothing but indignation and vengeance, how shall it not\ntremble with fear? And if God be the object of its terror, how should it\nnot fly from him? But faith ought to seek God, not to fly from him. It\nappears, then, that we have not yet a complete definition of faith; since\na knowledge of the Divine will indefinitely, ought not to be accounted\nfaith. But suppose, instead of will,—the declaration of which is often\nproductive of fear and sorrow,—we substitute benevolence or mercy. This\nwill certainly bring us nearer to the nature of faith. For we are allured\nto seek God, after we have learned that salvation is laid up for us with\nhim; which is confirmed to us by his declaring it to be the object of his\ncare and affection. Therefore we need a promise of grace, to assure us\nthat he is our propitious Father; since we cannot approach to him without\nit, and it is upon that alone that the human heart can securely depend.\nFor this reason, in the Psalms, mercy and truth are generally united, as\nbeing closely connected; because it would be of no avail for us to know\nthe veracity of God, if he did not allure us to himself by his mercy; nor\nshould we embrace his mercy, if he did not offer it with his own mouth. “I\nhave declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy\nloving‐kindness and thy truth. Let thy loving‐kindness and thy truth\ncontinually preserve me.”(1452) Again: “Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the\nheavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.”(1453) Again: “All\nthe paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his\ncovenant.”(1454) Again: “His merciful kindness is great towards us; and\nthe truth of the Lord endureth for ever.”(1455) Again: “I will praise thy\nname for thy loving‐kindness, and for thy truth.”(1456) I forbear to quote\nwhat we read in the prophets to the same purport, that God is merciful and\nfaithful in his promises. For it will be temerity to conclude that God is\npropitious to us, unless he testify concerning himself, and anticipate us\nby his invitation, that his will respecting us may be neither ambiguous\nnor obscure. But we have already seen, that Christ is the only pledge of\nhis love, without whom the tokens of his hatred and wrath are manifest\nboth above and below. Now, since the knowledge of the Divine goodness will\nnot be attended with much advantage, unless it lead us to rely upon it, we\nmust exclude that apprehension of it which is mixed with doubts, which is\nnot uniform and steady, but wavering and undecided. Now, the human mind,\nblinded and darkened as it is, is very far from being able to penetrate\nand attain to a knowledge of the Divine will; and the heart also,\nfluctuating in perpetual hesitation, is far from continuing unshaken in\nthat persuasion. Therefore our mind must be illuminated, and our heart\nestablished by some exterior power, that the word of God may obtain full\ncredit with us. Now, we shall have a complete definition of faith, if we\nsay, that it is a steady and certain knowledge of the Divine benevolence\ntowards us, which, being founded on the truth of the gratuitous promise in\nChrist, is both revealed to our minds, and confirmed to our hearts, by the\nHoly Spirit.\nVIII. But before I proceed any further, it will be necessary to make some\npreliminary observations, for the solution of difficulties, which\notherwise might prove obstacles in the way of the reader.\nAnd first, we must refute the nugatory distinction, which prevails in the\nschools, of formal and informal faith. For they imagine, that such as are\nnot impressed with any fear of God, or with any sense of piety, believe\nall that is necessary to be known in order to salvation; as though the\nHoly Spirit, in illuminating our hearts to faith, were not a witness to us\nof our adoption. Yet, in opposition to the whole tenor of Scripture, they\npresumptuously dignify such a persuasion, destitute of the fear of God,\nwith the name of faith. We need not contend with this definition any\nfurther than by simply describing the nature of faith, as it is\nrepresented in the Divine word. And this will clearly evince the ignorance\nand insipidity of their clamour concerning it. I have treated it in part\nalready, and shall subjoin what remains in its proper place. At present, I\naffirm, that a greater absurdity than this figment of theirs, cannot\npossibly be imagined. They maintain faith to be a mere assent, with which\nevery despiser of God may receive as true whatever is contained in the\nScripture. But first it should be examined, whether every man acquires\nfaith for himself by his own power, or whether it is by faith that the\nHoly Spirit becomes the witness of adoption. They betray puerile folly,\ntherefore, in inquiring whether faith, which is formed by the\nsuperaddition of a quality, be the same, or whether it be a new and\ndifferent faith. It clearly appears, that while they have been trifling in\nthis manner, they never thought of the peculiar gift of the Spirit; for\nthe commencement of faith contains in it the reconciliation by which man\ndraws near to God. But, if they would duly consider that declaration of\nPaul, “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness,”(1457) they would\ncease their trifling about this superadded quality. If we had only this\none reason, it ought to be sufficient to terminate the controversy—that\nthe assent which we give to the Divine word, as I have partly suggested\nbefore, and shall again more largely repeat, is from the heart rather than\nthe head, and from the affections rather than the understanding. For which\nreason it is called “the obedience of faith,”(1458) to which the Lord\nprefers no other obedience; because nothing is more precious to him than\nhis own truth; which, according to the testimony of John the\nBaptist,(1459) believers, as it were, subscribe and seal. As this is by no\nmeans a dubious point, we conclude at once, that it is an absurdity to\nsay, that faith is formed by the addition of a pious affection to an\nassent of the mind; whereas, even this assent consists in a pious\naffection, and is so described in the Scriptures. But another argument\noffers itself, which is still plainer. Since faith accepts Christ, as he\nis offered to us by the Father; and he is offered, not only for\nrighteousness, remission of sins, and peace, but also for sanctification\nand as a fountain of living water; it is certain, that no man can ever\nknow him aright, unless he at the same time receive the sanctification of\nthe Spirit. Or, if any one would wish it to be more clearly expressed,\nFaith consists in a knowledge of Christ. Christ cannot be known without\nthe sanctification of his Spirit. Consequently, faith is absolutely\ninseparable from a pious affection.\nIX. This passage of Paul, “Though I have all faith, so that I could remove\nmountains, and have not charity, I am nothing,”(1460) is generally adduced\nby them to support the notion of an informal faith unaccompanied with\ncharity; but they overlook the sense in which the apostle uses the word\n“faith” in this place. For having, in the preceding chapter, treated of\nthe various gifts of the Spirit, among which he has enumerated “divers\nkinds of tongues, the working of miracles and prophecy,”(1461) and having\nexhorted the Corinthians to “covet earnestly the best gifts,” from which\nthe greatest benefit and advantage would accrue to the whole body of the\nChurch, he adds, “yet show I unto you a more excellent way;” implying,\nthat all such gifts, whatever be their intrinsic excellence, are yet to be\ndeemed worthless, unless they be subservient to charity; for that, being\ngiven for the edification of the Church, if not employed for that purpose,\nthey lose their beauty and value. To prove this, he particularly specifies\nthem, repeating the same gifts, which he had before enumerated, but under\nother names. He uses the word “faith” to denote what he had before called\npowers, (δυναμεις, _potestates_, _virtutes_,) that is, a power of working\nmiracles. This, then, whether it be called power or faith, being a\nparticular gift of God, which any impious man may both possess and abuse,\nas the gift of tongues, or prophecy, or other gifts, we need not wonder if\nit be separated from charity. But the mistake of such persons arises\nwholly from this—that though the word “faith” is used in many senses, not\nobserving this diversity of signification, they argue as if it had always\nthe same meaning. The passage which they adduce from James in support of\nthe same error, shall be discussed in another place. Now, although, for\nthe sake of instruction, when we design to show the nature of that\nknowledge of God, which is possessed by the impious, we allow that there\nare various kinds of faith, yet we acknowledge and preach only one faith\nin the pious, according to the doctrine of the Scripture. Many men\ncertainly believe that there is a God; they admit the evangelical history\nand the other parts of Scripture to be true; just as we form an opinion of\ntransactions which are narrated as having occurred in former times, or of\nwhich we have ourselves been spectators. There are some who go further;\nesteeming the word of God as an undoubted revelation from heaven, not\nwholly disregarding its precepts, and being in some measure affected both\nby its denunciations and by its promises. To such persons, indeed, faith\nis attributed; but by a catachresis, a tropical or improper form of\nexpression; because they do not with open impiety resist, or reject, or\ncontemn the word of God, but rather exhibit some appearance of obedience\nto it.\nX. But this shadow or image of faith, as it is of no importance, so is\nunworthy of the name of faith; its great distance from the substantial\ntruth of which, though we shall show more at large hereafter, there can be\nno objection to its being briefly pointed out here. Simon Magus(1462) is\nsaid to have believed, who, nevertheless, just after, betrays his\nunbelief. When faith is attributed to him, we do not apprehend, with some,\nthat he merely pretended to it with his lips, while he had none in his\nheart; but we rather think, that being overcome with the majesty of the\ngospel, he did exercise a kind of faith, and perceived Christ to be the\nauthor of life and salvation, so as freely to profess himself one of his\nfollowers. Thus, in the Gospel of Luke, those persons are said to believe\nfor a time, in whom the seed of the word is prematurely choked before it\nfructifies, and those in whom it takes no root, but soon dries up and\nperishes. We doubt not but such persons, being attracted with some taste\nof the word, receive it with avidity, and begin to perceive something of\nits Divine power; so that by the fallacious counterfeit of faith, they\nimpose not only on the eyes of men, but even on their own minds. For they\npersuade themselves, that the reverence which they show for the word of\nGod, is real piety; supposing that there is no impiety but a manifest and\nacknowledged abuse or contempt of it. But, whatever be the nature of that\nassent, it penetrates not to the heart, so as to fix its residence there;\nand though it sometimes appears to have shot forth roots, yet there is no\nlife in them. The heart of man has so many recesses of vanity, and so many\nretreats of falsehood, and is so enveloped with fraudulent hypocrisy, that\nit frequently deceives even himself. But let them, who glory in such\nphantoms of faith, know, that in this respect they are not at all superior\nto devils. Persons of the former description, who hear and understand\nwithout any emotion those things, the knowledge of which makes devils\ntremble, are certainly far inferior to the fallen spirits; and the others\nare equal to them in this respect—that the sentiments with which they are\nimpressed, finally terminate in terror and consternation.(1463)\nXI. I know that it appears harsh to some, when faith is attributed to the\nreprobate; since Paul affirms it to be the fruit of election. But this\ndifficulty is easily solved; for, though none are illuminated to faith, or\ntruly feel the efficacy of the gospel, but such as are preordained to\nsalvation, yet experience shows, that the reprobate are sometimes affected\nwith emotions very similar to those of the elect, so that, in their own\nopinion, they in no respect differ from the elect. Wherefore, it is not at\nall absurd, that a taste of heavenly gifts is ascribed to them by the\napostle, and a temporary faith by Christ:(1464) not that they truly\nperceive the energy of spiritual grace and clear light of faith, but\nbecause the Lord, to render their guilt more manifest and inexcusable,\ninsinuates himself into their minds, as far as his goodness can be enjoyed\nwithout the Spirit of adoption. If any one object, that there remains,\nthen, no further evidence by which the faithful can certainly judge of\ntheir adoption, I reply, that although there is a great similitude and\naffinity between the elect of God and those who are endued with a frail\nand transitory faith, yet the elect possess that confidence, which Paul\ncelebrates, so as boldly to “cry, Abba, Father.”(1465) Therefore, as God\nregenerates for ever the elect alone with incorruptible seed, so that the\nseed of life planted in their hearts never perishes, so he firmly seals\nwithin them the grace of his adoption, that it may be confirmed and\nratified to their minds. But this by no means prevents that inferior\noperation of the Spirit from exerting itself even in the reprobate. In the\nmean time the faithful are taught to examine themselves with solicitude\nand humility, lest carnal security insinuate itself, instead of the\nassurance of faith. Besides, the reprobate have only a confused perception\nof grace, so that they embrace the shadow rather than the substance;\nbecause the Spirit properly seals remission of sins in the elect alone,\nand they apply it by a special faith to their own benefit. Yet the\nreprobate are justly said to believe that God is propitious to them,\nbecause they receive the gift of reconciliation, though in a confused and\ntoo indistinct manner: not that they are partakers of the same faith or\nregeneration with the sons of God, but because they appear, under the\ndisguise of hypocrisy, to have the principle of faith in common with them.\nNor do I deny, that God so far enlightens their minds, that they discover\nhis grace; but he so distinguishes that perception from the peculiar\ntestimony, which he gives to his elect, that they never attain any solid\neffect and enjoyment. For he does not, therefore, show himself propitious\nto them, by truly delivering them from death, and receiving them under his\nprotection; but he only manifests to them present mercy. But he vouchsafes\nto the elect alone, the living root of faith, that they may persevere even\nto the end. Thus we have refuted the objection, that if God truly\ndiscovers his grace, it remains for ever; because nothing prevents God\nfrom illuminating some with a present perception of his grace, which\nafterwards vanishes away.\nXII. Moreover, though faith is a knowledge of the benevolence of God\ntowards us, and a certain persuasion of his veracity, yet it is not to be\nwondered at, that the subjects of these temporary impressions lose the\nsense of Divine love, which, notwithstanding its affinity to faith, is yet\nwidely different from it. The will of God, I confess, is immutable, and\nhis truth always consistent with itself. But I deny that the reprobate\never go so far as to penetrate to that secret revelation, which the\nScripture confines to the elect. I deny, therefore, that they either\napprehend the will of God, as it is immutable, or embrace his truth with\nconstancy; because they rest in a fugitive sentiment. Thus a tree, not\nplanted deeply enough to shoot forth living roots, in process of time\nwithers; though for some years it may produce not only leaves and\nblossoms, but even fruits. Finally, as the defection of the first man was\nsufficient to obliterate the Divine image from his mind and soul, so we\nneed not wonder if God enlightens the reprobate with some beams of his\ngrace, which he afterwards suffers to be extinguished. Nor does any thing\nprevent him from slightly tincturing some with the knowledge of his\ngospel, and thoroughly imbuing others with it. It must, nevertheless, be\nremembered, that how diminutive and weak soever faith may be in the elect,\nyet, as the Spirit of God is a certain pledge and seal to them of their\nadoption, his impression can never be erased from their hearts; but that\nthe reprobate have only a few scattered rays of light, which are\nafterwards lost; yet that the Spirit is not chargeable with deception,\nbecause he infuses no life into the seed which he drops in their hearts,\nthat it may remain for ever incorruptible, as in the elect. I go still\nfurther; for since it is evident from the tenor of the Scripture, and from\ndaily experience, that the reprobate are sometimes affected with a sense\nof Divine grace, some desire of mutual love must necessarily be excited in\ntheir hearts. Thus Saul had for a time a pious disposition to love God,\nfrom whom experiencing paternal kindness, he was allured by the charms of\nhis goodness. But as the persuasion of the paternal love of God is not\nradically fixed in the reprobate, so they love him not reciprocally with\nthe sincere affection of children, but are influenced by a mercenary\ndisposition; for the spirit of love was given to Christ alone, that he\nmight instil it into his members. And this observation of Paul certainly\nextends to none but the elect: “The love of God is shed abroad in our\nhearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us;”(1466) the same love,\nwhich generates that confidence of invocation which I have before\nmentioned. Thus, on the contrary, we see that God is wonderfully angry\nwith his children, whom he ceases not to love: not that he really hates\nthem, but because he designs to terrify them with a sense of his wrath, to\nhumble their carnal pride, to shake off their indolence, and to excite\nthem to repentance. Therefore they apprehend him to be both angry with\nthem, or at least with their sins, and propitious to them at the same\ntime; for they sincerely deprecate his wrath, and yet resort to him for\nsuccour with tranquillity and confidence. Hence it appears, that faith is\nnot hypocritically counterfeited by some, who nevertheless are destitute\nof true faith; but, while they are hurried away with a sudden impetuosity\nof zeal, they deceive themselves by a false opinion. Nor is it to be\ndoubted, that indolence preoccupies them, and prevents them from properly\nexamining their hearts as they ought to do. It is probable that those\npersons were of this description, to whom, according to John, “Jesus did\nnot commit himself,” notwithstanding that they believed in him, “because\nhe knew all men: he knew what was in man.”(1467) If multitudes did not\ndepart from the common faith, (I style it common, because there is a great\nsimilitude and affinity between temporary faith and that which is living\nand perpetual,) Christ would not have said to his disciples, “If ye\ncontinue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know\nthe truth, and the truth shall make you free.”(1468) For he addresses\nthose who have embraced his doctrine, and exhorts them to an increase of\nfaith, that the light which they have received may not be extinguished by\ntheir own supineness. Therefore Paul claims faith as peculiar to the\nelect,(1469) indicating that many decay, because they have had no living\nroot. Thus also Christ says in Matthew, “Every plant, which my heavenly\nFather hath not planted, shall be rooted up.”(1470) There is a grosser\ndeception in others, who are not ashamed to attempt to deceive both God\nand men. James inveighs against this class of men, who impiously profane\nfaith by hypocritical pretensions to it.(1471) Nor would Paul require from\nthe children of God, a “faith unfeigned,”(1472) but because multitudes\npresumptuously arrogate to themselves what they possess not, and with\ntheir vain pretences deceive others, and sometimes even themselves.\nTherefore he compares a good conscience to a vessel in which faith is\nkept; because many, “having put away a good conscience, concerning faith\nhave made shipwreck.”(1473)\nXIII. We must also remember the ambiguous signification of the word\n_faith_; for frequently faith signifies the sound doctrine of piety, as in\nthe place which we have just cited, and in the same Epistle, where Paul\nsays, that deacons must hold “the mystery of the faith in a pure\nconscience.”(1474) Also where he predicts the apostasy of some “from the\nfaith.”(1475) But, on the contrary, he says, that Timothy had been\n“nourished up in the words of faith.”(1476) Again, where he says,\n“avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science, falsely\nso called; which some professing, have erred concerning the faith;”(1477)\nwhom in another place he styles “reprobates concerning the faith.”(1478)\nThus, also, when he directs Titus to “rebuke them, that they may be sound\nin the faith,”(1479) by soundness, he means nothing more than that purity\nof doctrine, which is so liable to be corrupted and to degenerate through\nthe instability of men. Since “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge\nare hidden in Christ,”(1480) whom faith possesses, faith is justly\nextended to the whole summary of heavenly doctrines, with which it is\ninseparably connected. On the contrary, it is sometimes restricted to a\nparticular object; as when Matthew says, that “Jesus saw their\nfaith,”(1481) who let down the paralytic man through the roof; and when\nChrist exclaimed respecting the centurion, “I have not found so great\nfaith, no, not in Israel.”(1482) But it is probable, that the centurion\nwas wholly intent on the recovery of his son, a concern for whom wholly\noccupied his mind; yet, because he was contented with the mere answer of\nChrist, without being importunate for his corporeal presence, it is on\naccount of this circumstance that his faith is so greatly extolled. And we\nhave lately shown, that Paul uses faith for the gift of miracles; which is\npossessed by those who are neither regenerated by the Spirit of God, nor\nserious worshippers of him. In another place, also, he uses it to denote\nthe instruction by which we are edified in the faith; for, when he\nsuggests that faith will be abolished, it must undoubtedly be referred to\nthe ministry of the Church, which is, at present, useful to our infirmity.\nIn these forms of expression, however, there is an evident analogy. But\nwhen the word “faith” is in an improper sense transferred to a\nhypocritical profession, or to that which falsely assumes the name, it\nshould not be accounted a harsher catachresis, than when the fear of God\nis used for a corrupt and perverse worship; as when it is frequently said\nin the sacred history, that the foreign nations, which had been\ntransplanted to Samaria and its vicinity, feared the fictitious deities\nand the God of Israel; which is like confounding together heaven and\nearth. But our present inquiry is, what is that faith by which the\nchildren of God are distinguished from unbelievers, by which we invoke God\nas our Father, by which we pass from death to life, and by which Christ,\nour eternal life and salvation, dwells in us? The force and nature of it,\nI conceive, I have concisely and clearly explained.\nXIV. Now, let us again examine all the parts of that definition; a careful\nconsideration of which, I think, will leave nothing doubtful remaining.\nWhen we call it knowledge, we intend not such a comprehension as men\ncommonly have of those things which fall under the notice of their senses.\nFor it is so superior, that the human mind must exceed and rise above\nitself, in order to attain to it. Nor does the mind which attains it\ncomprehend what it perceives, but being persuaded of that which it cannot\ncomprehend, it understands more by the certainty of this persuasion, than\nit would comprehend of any human object by the exercise of its natural\ncapacity. Wherefore Paul beautifully expresses it in these terms: “to\ncomprehend what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to\nknow the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.”(1483) For he meant to\nsuggest, that what our mind apprehends by faith is absolutely infinite,\nand that this kind of knowledge far exceeds all understanding. Yet,\nbecause God has revealed to his saints the secret of his will, “which had\nbeen hidden from ages and from generations,”(1484) therefore _faith_ is in\nScripture justly styled “an acknowledgment;”(1485) and by John,\n“knowledge,” when he asserts, that believers know that they are the sons\nof God.(1486) And they have indeed a certain knowledge of it; but are\nrather confirmed by a persuasion of the veracity of God, than taught by\nany demonstration of reason. The language of Paul also indicates this:\n“whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord; for we\nwalk by faith, not by sight.” By this he shows that the things which we\nunderstand through faith, are at a distance from us, and beyond our sight.\nWhence we conclude, that the knowledge of faith consists more in certainty\nthan in comprehension.\nXV. To express the solid constancy of the persuasion, we further say, that\nit is a certain and steady knowledge. For, as faith is not content with a\ndubious and versatile opinion, so neither with an obscure and perplexed\nconception; but requires a full and fixed certainty, such as is commonly\nobtained respecting things that have been tried and proved. For unbelief\nis so deeply rooted in our hearts, and such is our propensity to it, that\nthough all men confess with the tongue, that God is faithful, no man can\npersuade himself of the truth of it, without the most arduous exertions.\nEspecially when the time of trial comes, the general indecision discloses\nthe fault which was previously concealed. Nor is it without reason that\nthe Holy Spirit asserts the authority of the Divine word in terms of such\nhigh commendation, but with a design to remedy the disease which I have\nmentioned, that the promises of God may obtain full credit with us. “The\nwords of the Lord (says David) are pure words; as silver tried in a\nfurnace of earth purified seven times.”(1487) Again: “The word of the Lord\nis tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.”(1488) And\nSolomon confirms the same, nearly in the same words: “Every word of God is\npure.”(1489) But, as the hundred and nineteenth Psalm is almost entirely\ndevoted to this subject, it were needless to recite any more testimonies.\nWhenever God thus recommends his word to us, he, without doubt, obliquely\nreprehends our unbelief; for the design of those recommendations is no\nother than to eradicate perverse doubts from our hearts. There are also\nmany, who have such conceptions of the Divine mercy, as to receive but\nvery little consolation from it. For they are at the same time distressed\nwith an unhappy anxiety, doubting whether he will be merciful to them;\nbecause they confine within too narrow limits that clemency, of which they\nsuppose themselves to be fully persuaded. For they reflect with themselves\nthus: that his mercy is large and copious, bestowed upon many, and ready\nfor the acceptance of all; but that it is uncertain whether it will reach\nthem also, or, rather, whether they shall reach it. This thought, since it\nstops in the midst of its course, is incomplete. Therefore it does not so\nmuch confirm the mind with secure tranquillity, as disturb it with\nrestless hesitation. But very different is the meaning of “full\nassurance,” (πληροφοριας,) which is always attributed to faith in the\nScriptures; and which places the goodness of God, that is clearly revealed\nto us, beyond all doubt. But this cannot take place, unless we have a real\nsense and experience of its sweetness in ourselves. Wherefore the apostle\nfrom faith deduces confidence, and from confidence boldness. For this is\nhis language: “In Christ we have boldness and access, with confidence by\nthe faith of him.”(1490) These words imply that we have no right faith,\nbut when we can venture with tranquillity into the Divine presence. This\nboldness arises only from a certain confidence of the Divine benevolence\nand our salvation; which is so true, that the word “faith” is frequently\nused for confidence.\nXVI. The principal hinge on which faith turns is this—that we must not\nconsider the promises of mercy, which the Lord offers, as true only to\nothers, and not to ourselves; but rather make them our own, by embracing\nthem in our hearts. Hence arises that confidence, which the same apostle\nin another place calls “peace;”(1491) unless any one would rather make\npeace the effect of confidence. It is a security, which makes the\nconscience calm and serene before the Divine tribunal, and without which\nit must necessarily be harassed and torn almost asunder with tumultuous\ntrepidation, unless it happen to slumber for a moment in an oblivion of\nGod and itself. And indeed it is but for a moment; for it does not long\nenjoy that wretched oblivion, but is most dreadfully wounded by the\nremembrance, which is perpetually recurring, of the Divine judgment. In\nshort, no man is truly a believer, unless he be firmly persuaded, that God\nis a propitious and benevolent Father to him, and promise himself every\nthing from his goodness; unless he depend on the promises of the Divine\nbenevolence to him, and feel an undoubted expectation of salvation; as the\napostle shows in these words: “If we hold fast the beginning of our\nconfidence steadfast unto the end.”(1492) Here he supposes, that no man\nhas a good hope in the Lord, who does not glory with confidence, in being\nan heir of the kingdom of heaven. He is no believer, I say, who does not\nrely on the security of his salvation, and confidently triumph over the\ndevil and death, as Paul teaches us in this remarkable peroration: “I am\npersuaded (says he) that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor\nprincipalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, shall\nbe able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our\nLord.”(1493) Thus the same apostle is of opinion, that “the eyes of our\nunderstanding” are not truly “enlightened,” unless we discover what is the\nhope of the eternal inheritance, to which we are called.(1494) And he\nevery where inculcates, that we have no just apprehensions of the Divine\ngoodness, unless we derive from it a considerable degree of assurance.\nXVII. But some one will object, that the experience of believers is very\ndifferent from this; for that, in recognizing the grace of God towards\nthem, they are not only disturbed with inquietude, (which frequently\nbefalls them,) but sometimes also tremble with the most distressing\nterrors. The vehemence of temptations, to agitate their minds, is so\ngreat, that it appears scarcely compatible with that assurance of faith of\nwhich we have been speaking. We must therefore solve this difficulty, if\nwe mean to support the doctrine we have advanced. When we inculcate, that\nfaith ought to be certain and secure, we conceive not of a certainty\nattended with no doubt, or of a security interrupted by no anxiety; but we\nrather affirm, that believers have a perpetual conflict with their own\ndiffidence, and are far from placing their consciences in a placid calm,\nnever disturbed by any storms. Yet, on the other hand, we deny, however\nthey may be afflicted, that they ever fall and depart from that certain\nconfidence which they have conceived in the Divine mercy. The Scripture\nproposes no example of faith more illustrious or memorable than David,\nespecially if you consider the whole course of his life. Yet that his mind\nwas not invariably serene, appears from his innumerable complaints, of\nwhich it will be sufficient to select a few. When he rebukes his soul for\nturbulent emotions, is he not angry with his unbelief? “Why (says he) art\nthou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? Hope thou in\nGod.”(1495) And, certainly, that consternation was an evident proof of\ndiffidence, as though he supposed himself to be forsaken by God. In\nanother place, also, we find a more ample confession: “I said, in my\nhaste, I am cut off from before thine eyes.”(1496) In another place, also,\nhe debates with himself in anxious and miserable perplexity, and even\nraises a dispute concerning the nature of God: “Hath God forgotten to be\ngracious? Will the Lord cast off for ever?” What follows is still harsher:\n“And I said, I must fall; these are the changes of the right hand of the\nMost High.”(1497) For, in a state of despair, he consigns himself to ruin;\nand not only confesses that he is agitated with doubts, but, as vanquished\nin the conflict, considers all as lost; because God has deserted him, and\nturned to his destruction that hand which used to support him. Wherefore\nit is not without reason that he says, “Return unto thy rest, O my\nsoul;”(1498) since he had experienced such fluctuations amidst the waves\nof trouble. And yet, wonderful as it is, amidst these concussions, faith\nsustains the hearts of the pious, and truly resembles the palm‐tree,\nrising with vigour undiminished by any burdens which may be laid upon it,\nbut which can never retard its growth; as David, when he might appear to\nbe overwhelmed, yet, chiding himself, ceased not to aspire towards God.\nIndeed, he who, contending with his own infirmity, strives in his\nanxieties to exercise faith, is already in a great measure victorious.\nWhich we may infer from such passages as this: “Wait on the Lord: be of\ngood courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart; wait, I say, on the\nLord.”(1499) He reproves himself for timidity, and repeating the same\ntwice, confesses himself to be frequently subject to various agitations.\nIn the mean time, he is not only displeased with himself for these faults,\nbut ardently aspires towards the correction of them. Now, if we enter into\na close and correct examination of his character and conduct, and compare\nhim with Ahaz, we shall discover a considerable difference. Isaiah is sent\nto convey consolation to the anxiety of the impious and hypocritical king;\nhe addresses him in these words: “Take heed, and be quiet; fear not,”\n&c.(1500) But what effect had the message on him? As it had been before\nsaid, that “his heart was moved as the trees of the wood are moved with\nthe wind,”(1501) though he heard the promise, he ceased not to tremble.\nThis therefore is the proper reward and punishment of infidelity—so to\ntremble with fear, that he who opens not the gate to himself by faith, in\nthe time of temptation departs from God; but, on the contrary, believers,\nwhom the weight of temptations bends and almost oppresses, constantly\nemerge from their distresses, though not without trouble and difficulty.\nAnd because they are conscious of their own imbecility, they pray with the\nPsalmist, “Take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth.”(1502) By\nthese words we are taught, that they sometimes become dumb, as though\ntheir faith were destroyed; yet that they neither fail nor turn their\nbacks, but persevere in their conflict, and arouse their inactivity by\nprayer, that they may not be stupefied by self‐indulgence.\nXVIII. To render this intelligible, it is necessary to recur to that\ndivision of the flesh and the spirit, which we noticed in another place,\nand which most clearly discovers itself in this case. The pious heart\ntherefore perceives a division in itself, being partly affected with\ndelight, through a knowledge of the Divine goodness; partly distressed\nwith sorrow, through a sense of its own calamity; partly relying on the\npromise of the gospel; partly trembling at the evidence of its own\niniquity; partly exulting in the apprehension of life; partly alarmed by\nthe fear of death. This variation happens through the imperfection of\nfaith; since we are never so happy, during the present life, as to be\ncured of all diffidence, and entirely filled and possessed by faith. Hence\nthose conflicts, in which the diffidence which adheres to the relics of\nthe flesh, rises up in opposition to the faith formed in the heart. But\nif, in the mind of a believer, assurance be mixed with doubts, do we not\nalways come to this point, that faith consists not in a certain and clear,\nbut only in an obscure and perplexed knowledge of the Divine will\nrespecting us? Not at all. For, if we are distracted by various thoughts,\nwe are not therefore entirely divested of faith; neither, though harassed\nby the agitations of diffidence, are we therefore immerged in its abyss;\nnor, if we be shaken, are we therefore overthrown. For the invariable\nissue of this contest is, that faith at length surmounts those\ndifficulties, from which, while it is encompassed with them, it appears to\nbe in danger.\nXIX. Let us sum it up thus: As soon as the smallest particle of grace is\ninfused into our minds, we begin to contemplate the Divine countenance as\nnow placid, serene, and propitious to us: it is indeed a very distant\nprospect, but so clear, that we know we are not deceived. Afterwards, in\nproportion as we improve,—for we ought to be continually improving by\nprogressive advances,—we arrive at a nearer, and therefore more certain\nview of him, and by continual habit he becomes more familiar to us. Thus\nwe see, that a mind illuminated by the knowledge of God, is at first\ninvolved in much ignorance, which is removed by slow degrees. Yet it is\nnot prevented either by its ignorance of some things, or by its obscure\nview of what it beholds, from enjoying a clear knowledge of the Divine\nwill respecting itself, which is the first and principal exercise of\nfaith. For, as a man who is confined in a prison, into which the sun\nshines only obliquely and partially through a very small window, is\ndeprived of a full view of that luminary, yet clearly perceives its\nsplendour, and experiences its beneficial influence,—thus we, who are\nbound with terrestrial and corporeal fetters, though surrounded on all\nsides with great obscurity, are nevertheless illuminated, sufficiently for\nall the purposes of real security, by the light of God shining ever so\nfeebly to discover his mercy.\nXX. The apostle beautifully inculcates both these ideas in various places.\nFor when he says, that “we know in part, and we prophesy in part, and see\nthrough a glass darkly,”(1503) he indicates, how very slender a portion of\nthat wisdom which is truly Divine, is conferred upon us in the present\nlife. For although these words imply, not only that faith remains\nimperfect as long as we groan under the burden of the flesh, but that our\nimperfection renders it necessary for us to be unremittingly employed in\nacquiring further knowledge, yet he suggests, that it is impossible for\nour narrow capacity to comprehend that which is infinite. And this Paul\npredicates concerning the whole Church; though every individual of us is\nobstructed and retarded, by his own ignorance, from making that progress\nwhich might be wished. But what a sure and certain experience, of itself,\neven the smallest particle of faith gives us, the same apostle shows in\nanother place, where he asserts, that “we, with open face, beholding as in\na glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image.”(1504)\nSuch profound ignorance must necessarily involve much doubt and\ntrepidation; especially as our hearts are, by a kind of natural instinct,\ninclined to unbelief. Besides, temptations, various and innumerable,\nfrequently assail us with great violence. Above all, our own conscience,\noppressed by its incumbent load of sin, sometimes complains and groans\nwithin itself, sometimes accuses itself, sometimes murmurs in secret, and\nsometimes is openly disturbed. Whether, therefore, adversity discover the\nwrath of God, or the conscience find in itself any reason or cause of it,\nthence unbelief derives weapons to oppose faith, which are perpetually\ndirected to this object, to persuade us, that God is angry with us, and\ninimical to us; that we may not hope for any assistance from him, but may\ndread him as our irreconcilable enemy.\nXXI. To sustain these attacks, faith arms and defends itself with the word\nof the Lord. And when such a temptation as this assails us,—that God is\nour enemy, because he is angry with us,—faith, on the contrary, objects,\nthat he is merciful even when he afflicts, because chastisement proceeds\nrather from love than from wrath. When it is pressed with this thought,\nthat God is an avenger of iniquities, it opposes the pardon provided for\nall offences, whenever the sinner makes application to the Divine\nclemency. Thus the pious mind, how strangely soever it may be agitated and\nharassed, rises at length superior to all difficulties, nor ever suffers\nits confidence in the Divine mercy to be shaken. The various disputes\nwhich exercise and fatigue it, terminate rather in the confirmation of\nthat confidence. It is a proof of this, that when the saints conceive\nthemselves to feel most the vengeance of God, they still confide their\ncomplaints to him, and when there is no appearance of his hearing them,\nthey continue to call upon him. For what end would be answered by\naddressing complaint to him from whom they expected no consolation? And\nthey would never be disposed to call upon him, unless they believed him to\nbe ready to assist them.(1505) Thus the disciples, whom Christ reprehends\nfor the weakness of their faith, complained indeed that they were\nperishing, but still they implored his assistance. Nor, when he chides\nthem on account of their weak faith, does he reject them from the number\nof his children, or class them with unbelievers; but he excites them to\ncorrect that fault. Therefore we repeat the assertion already made, that\nfaith is never eradicated from a pious heart, but continues firmly fixed,\nhowever it may be shaken, and seem to bend this way or that; that its\nlight is never so extinguished or smothered, but that it lies at least\nconcealed under embers; and that this is an evident proof, that the word,\nwhich is an incorruptible seed, produces fruit similar to itself, whose\ngerm never entirely perishes. For, though it is the last cause of despair\nthat can happen to saints, to perceive, according to their apprehension of\npresent circumstances, the hand of God lifted up for their destruction,\nyet Job asserts the extent of his hope to be such, that though he should\nbe slain by him, he would continue to trust in him.(1506) This, then, is\nthe real state of the case: Unbelief is not inwardly predominant in the\nhearts of the pious, but it assails them from without; nor do its weapons\nmortally wound them; they only molest them, or at least inflict such\nwounds as are curable. For faith, according to Paul, serves us as a\nshield, which, being opposed to hostile weapons, receives their blows, and\nentirely repels them, or at least breaks their force, so that they\npenetrate no vital part. When faith is shaken, therefore, it is just as if\na soldier, otherwise bold, were constrained, by a violent stroke of a\njavelin, to change his position and retreat a little; but when faith\nitself is wounded, it is just as if his shield were broken by a blow, yet\nnot pierced through. For the pious mind will always recover so far as to\nsay, with David, “Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\nI will fear no evil; for thou art with me.”(1507) To walk in the gloom of\ndeath is certainly terrible; and believers, whatever degree of firmness\nthey have, cannot but dread it. But when this thought prevails, that God\nis present with them, and concerned for their salvation, fear at once\ngives way to security. But, as Augustine says, whatever powerful engines\nthe devil erects against us, when he possesses not the heart, which is the\nresidence of faith, he is kept at a distance. Thus, if we judge from the\nevent, believers not only escape in safety from every battle, so that,\nreceiving an accession of vigour, they are soon after prepared to enter\nthe field again, but we see the accomplishment of what John says, in his\ncanonical Epistle: “This is the victory that overcometh the world, even\nour faith.”(1508) For he affirms, that it will be not only victorious in\none or in a few battles, or against some particular assault, but that it\nwill overcome the whole world, though it should be attacked a thousand\ntimes.\nXXII. There is another species of fear and trembling, by which,\nnevertheless, the assurance of faith is so far from being impaired, that\nit is more firmly established. That is, when believers, considering the\nexamples of the Divine vengeance against the impious as lessons given to\nthem, are solicitously cautious not to provoke the wrath of God against\nthemselves by the same crimes; or when, feeling their own misery, they\nlearn to place all their dependence on the Lord, without whom they\nperceive themselves to be more inconstant and transient than the wind. For\nwhen the apostle, by a representation of the punishments which the Lord\nformerly inflicted on the Israelitish nation, alarms the fears of the\nCorinthians, lest they should involve themselves in the same\ncalamities,(1509) he in no respect weakens their confidence, but shakes\noff the indolence of the flesh, by which faith is rather impaired than\nconfirmed. Nor when, from the fall of the Jews, he takes an occasion to\nexhort him that standeth to beware lest he fall,(1510) does he direct us\nto waver, as though we were uncertain of our stability; but only forbids\nall arrogance and presumptuous, overweening confidence in our own\nstrength, that the Gentiles may not proudly insult over the expelled Jews,\ninto whose place they have been received.(1511) In that passage, however,\nhe not only addresses believers, but in his discourse also includes\nhypocrites, who gloried merely in external appearance. For he admonishes\nnot men individually, but instituting a comparison between the Jews and\nthe Gentiles, after having shown that the rejection of the former was a\nrighteous punishment for their unbelief and ingratitude, he exhorts the\nlatter not to lose, by pride and haughtiness, the grace of adoption\nrecently transferred to them. But as, in the general rejection of the\nJews, there remained some of them who fell not from the covenant of\nadoption, so among the Gentiles there might possibly arise some, who,\ndestitute of true faith, would only be inflated with foolish and carnal\nconfidence, and thus abuse the goodness of God to their own ruin. But\nthough you should understand this to be spoken to the elect and believers,\nno inconvenience would result from it. For it is one thing to repress the\ntemerity, which from remaining carnality sometimes discovers itself in the\nsaints, that it may not produce vain confidence; and another to strike the\nconscience with fear, that it may not rely with full security on the mercy\nof God.\nXXIII. Moreover, when he teaches us to “work out our own salvation with\nfear and trembling,”(1512) he only requires us to accustom ourselves, with\ngreat self‐humiliation, to look up to the power of the Lord. For nothing\narouses us to repose all confidence and assurance of mind on the Lord, so\nmuch as diffidence of ourselves, and anxiety arising from a consciousness\nof our own misery. In which sense, we must understand this declaration of\nthe Psalmist, “I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy,\nand in thy fear will I worship.”(1513) Whence he beautifully connects the\nconfidence of faith, which relies on the mercy of God, with that religious\nfear by which we ought to be affected, whenever we come into the presence\nof the Divine Majesty, and from its splendour, discover our extreme\nimpurity. Solomon also truly pronounces, “Happy is the man who feareth\nalway; but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.”(1514)\nBut he intends that fear which will render us more cautious, not such as\nwould afflict and ruin us, such as, when the mind, confounded in itself,\nrecovers itself in God; dejected in itself, finds consolation in him; and\ndespairing of itself, revives with confidence in him. Wherefore nothing\nprevents believers from being distressed with fear, and at the same time\nenjoying the most serene consolation; as they now turn their eyes towards\ntheir own vanity, and now direct the attention of their mind to the truth\nof God. How can fear and faith, it will be asked, both reside in the same\nmind? Just as, on the contrary, insensibility and anxiety. For though the\nimpious endeavour to acquire a habit of insensibility, that they may not\nbe disquieted by the fear of God, the judgment of God follows them so\nclosely, that they cannot attain the object of their desires. So nothing\nprevents God from training his people to humility, that in their valiant\nwarfare they may restrain themselves within the bounds of modesty. And\nthat this was the design of the apostle appears from the context, where,\nas the cause of fear and trembling, he assigns the good pleasure of God,\nby which he gives to his people both rightly to will, and strenuously to\nperform. In the same sense we should understand this prediction: “The\nchildren of Israel shall fear the Lord and his goodness;”(1515) for not\nonly piety produces a reverence of God, but also the sweetness of grace\nfills a man that is dejected in himself, with fear and admiration; causing\nhim to depend upon God, and humbly submit himself to his power.\nXXIV. Yet we give no encouragement to the very pestilent philosophy, begun\nto be broached by some semi‐Papists in the present day. For, being unable\nto defend that gross notion of faith as a doubtful opinion, which has been\ntaught in the schools, they resort to another invention, and propose a\nconfidence mixed with unbelief. They confess, that whenever we look to\nChrist, we find in him a sufficient ground of comfortable hope; but\nbecause we are always unworthy of all those blessings which are offered to\nus in Christ, they wish us to fluctuate and hesitate in the view of our\nown unworthiness. In short, they place the conscience in such a state\nbetween hope and fear, that it alternately inclines to both. They also\nconnect hope and fear together, so that when the former rises, it\ndepresses the latter, and when the latter lifts its head, the former\nfalls. Thus Satan, finding that those open engines, which he heretofore\nemployed to destroy the assurance of faith, are now no longer of any\navail, secretly endeavours to undermine it. But what kind of confidence\nwould that be, which should frequently give way to despair? If you\nconsider Christ, (say they,) salvation is certain; if you return to\nyourself, condemnation is certain. Diffidence and good hope, therefore,\nmust of necessity alternately prevail in your mind. As though we ought to\nconsider Christ as standing apart from us, and not rather as dwelling\nwithin us. For we therefore expect salvation from him, not because he\nappears to us at a great distance, but because, having ingrafted us into\nhis body, he makes us partakers not only of all his benefits, but also of\nhimself. Wherefore I thus retort their own argument: If you consider\nyourself, condemnation is certain; but since Christ, with all his\nbenefits, is communicated to you, so that all that he has becomes yours,\nand you become a member of him, and one with him,—his righteousness covers\nyour sins; his salvation supersedes your condemnation; he interposes with\nhis merit, that your unworthiness may not appear in the Divine presence.\nIndeed, the truth is, that we ought by no means to separate Christ from\nus, or ourselves from him; but, with all our might, firmly to retain that\nfellowship by which he has united us to himself. Thus the apostle teaches\nus: “The body (says he) is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life\nbecause of righteousness.”(1516) According to this frivolous notion of\nthese persons, he ought to have said, Christ indeed has life in himself;\nbut you, being sinners, remain obnoxious to death and condemnation. But he\nspeaks in a very different manner; for he states, that the condemnation\nwhich we demerit in ourselves is swallowed up by the salvation of Christ;\nand in confirmation of this, uses the same argument as I have adduced,\nthat Christ is not without us, but dwells within us; and not only adheres\nto us by an indissoluble connection of fellowship, but by a certain\nwonderful communion coalesces daily more and more into one body with us,\ntill he becomes altogether one with us. Nor do I deny, what I have lately\nsaid, that some interruptions of faith at times occur, as its imbecility\nis by the force of violence inclined to this or the other direction, Thus,\nin the thick gloom of temptations, its light is smothered; but, whatever\nbefalls it, it never discontinues its efforts in seeking God.\nXXV. Bernard reasons in a similar manner, when he professedly discusses\nthis subject, in the Fifth Homily, on the Dedication of the Temple. “By\nthe goodness of God, meditating sometimes on the soul, I think I discover\nin it, as it were, two opposite characters. If I view it as it is in\nitself and of itself, I cannot utter a greater truth concerning it, than\nthat it is reduced to nothing. What need is there at present to enumerate\nall its miseries, how it is loaded with sins, enveloped in darkness,\nentangled with allurements, inflamed with inordinate desires, subject to\nthe passions, filled with illusions, always prone to evil, inclined to\nevery vice, and finally full of ignominy and confusion? Now, if even our\nrighteousnesses, when viewed in the light of truth, be found to be ‘as\nfilthy rags,’(1517) what judgment will be formed of our acknowledged\nunrighteousness? ‘If the light that is in’ us ‘be darkness, how great is\nthat darkness!’(1518) What then? Man is undoubtedly become like vanity;\nman is reduced to nothing; man is nothing. Yet how is he entirely nothing,\nwhom God magnifies? How is he nothing, on whom the heart of God is fixed?\nBrethren, let us revive again. Although we are nothing in our own hearts,\nperhaps there may be something for us latent in the heart of God. O Father\nof mercies, O Father of the miserable, how dost thou fix thine heart on\nus! For thine heart is where thy treasure is. But how are we thy treasure,\nif we are nothing? All nations are before thee as though they existed not;\nthey must be considered as nothing. That is, before thee; not within thee;\nthus it is in the judgment of thy truth; but not thus in the affection of\nthy clemency. Thou callest things which are not, as though they were; and\ntherefore they are not, because thou callest things which are not; yet\nthey are, because thou callest them. For though they are not, with\nreference to themselves, yet with thee they are; according to this\nexpression of Paul: ‘Not of works, but of him that calleth.’ ”(1519) After\nthis, Bernard says, that there is a wonderful connection between these two\nconsiderations. Things which are connected with each other, certainly do\nnot reciprocally destroy each other; which he also more plainly declares\nin the following conclusion: “Now, if we diligently examine what we are in\nboth considerations,—how in one view we are nothing, and in the other how\nwe are magnified,—I conceive that our boasting appears to be restrained;\nbut perhaps it is more increased, and indeed established, that we may\nglory not in ourselves, but in the Lord. If we reflect, if he has decreed\nto save us, we shall shortly be delivered; this is sufficient to recover\nus. But ascending to a loftier and more extensive prospect, let us seek\nthe city of God, let us seek his temple, let us seek his palace, let us\nseek his spouse. I have not forgotten, but with fear and reverence I say,\nWe are; but in the heart of God. We are; but by his condescending favour,\nnot by our own merit.”\nXXVI. Now, the fear of the Lord, which is universally ascribed to all the\nsaints, and which is called sometimes “the beginning of wisdom,”(1520)\nsometimes “wisdom”(1521) itself, although it be but one, proceeds from a\ntwofold apprehension of him. For God requires the reverence of a Father\nand of a Master. Therefore he who truly desires to worship him, will study\nto pay him the obedience of a son and the submission of a servant. The\nLord, by the prophet, distinguishes the obedience which is paid to him as\na father, by the appellation of honour; and the service which he receives\nas a master, by that of fear. “A son (says he) honoureth his father, and a\nservant his master. If, then, I be a father, where is mine honour? And if\nI be a master, where is my fear?”(1522) But notwithstanding his\ndistinction between them, you see how he confounds them together. Let the\nfear of the Lord therefore with us be a reverence mingled with this honour\nand fear. Nor is it surprising, that the same mind cherishes both these\naffections; for he who considers what a Father God is to us, has ample\nreason, even though there were no hell, to dread his displeasure more than\nany death. But, such is the propensity of our nature to the licentiousness\nof transgression, that in order to restrain it by every possible method,\nwe should at the same time indulge this reflection, that all iniquity is\nan abomination to the Lord, under whose power we live, and whose vengeance\nthey will not escape, who provoke his wrath against them by the wickedness\nof their lives.\nXXVII. Now, the assertion of John, that “there is no fear in love, but\nperfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment,”(1523) is not at\nall repugnant to what we have advanced. For he speaks of the terror of\nunbelief, between which and the fear of believers there is a wide\ndifference. For the impious fear not God from a dread of incurring his\ndispleasure, if they could do it with impunity; but because they know him\nto be armed with vindictive power, they tremble with horror at hearing of\nhis wrath. And thus also they fear his wrath, because they apprehend it to\nbe impending over them, because they every moment expect it to fall on\ntheir heads. But the faithful, as we have observed, fear his displeasure\nmore than punishment, and are not disturbed with the fear of punishment,\nas though it were impending over them, but are rendered more cautious that\nthey may not incur it. Thus the apostle, when addressing believers, says,\n“Let no man deceive you with vain words; for, because of these things\ncometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience [or\nunbelief.]”(1524) He threatens not its descending on them; but admonishes\nthem to consider the wrath of the Lord prepared for the impious, on\naccount of the crimes which he had enumerated, that they may avoid\ntempting it. It seldom happens, however, that the reprobate are aroused\nmerely by simple threatenings; but, on the contrary, being already\nobdurate and insensible, when God thunders from heaven, if it be only in\nwords, they rather harden themselves in rebellion; but when they feel the\nstroke of his hand, they are compelled to fear him, whether they will or\nnot. This is commonly called a servile fear, in opposition to a filial\nfear, which is ingenuous and voluntary. Some persons curiously introduce\nan intermediate species of fear; because that servile and constrained\naffection sometimes subdues men’s minds, so that they voluntarily approach\nto the fear of God.\nXXVIII. Now, in the Divine benevolence, which is affirmed to be the object\nof faith, we apprehend the possession of salvation and everlasting life to\nbe obtained. For, if no good can be wanting when God is propitious, we\nhave a sufficient certainty of salvation, when he himself assures us of\nhis love. “O God, cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved,”(1525)\nsays the Psalmist. Hence the Scriptures represent this as the sum of our\nsalvation, that he has “abolished” all “enmity,”(1526) and received us\ninto his favour. In which they imply, that since God is reconciled to us,\nthere remains no danger, but that all things will prosper with us.\nWherefore faith, having apprehended the love of God, has promises for the\npresent life and the life to come, and a solid assurance of all blessings;\nbut it is such an assurance as may be derived from the Divine word. For\nfaith certainly promises itself neither longevity, nor honour, nor wealth,\nin the present state; since the Lord has not been pleased to appoint any\nof these things for us; but is contented with this assurance, that\nwhatever we may want of the conveniences or necessaries of this life, yet\nGod will never leave us. But its principal security consists in an\nexpectation of the future life, which is placed beyond all doubt by the\nword of God. For whatever miseries and calamities may on earth await those\nwho are the objects of the love of God, they cannot prevent the Divine\nbenevolence from being a source of complete felicity. Therefore, when we\nmeant to express the perfection of blessedness, we have mentioned the\ngrace of God, as the fountain from which every species of blessings flows\ndown to us. And we may generally observe in the Scriptures, that when they\ntreat not only of eternal salvation, but of any blessing we enjoy, our\nattention is recalled to the love of God. For which reason David says,\nthat “The loving‐kindness of God,” when experienced in a pious heart, “is\nbetter” and more desirable “than life” itself.(1527) Finally, if we have\nan abundance of all things to the extent of our desires, but are uncertain\nof the love or hatred of God, our prosperity will be cursed, and therefore\nmiserable. But if the paternal countenance of God shine on us, even our\nmiseries will be blessed, because they will be converted into aids of our\nsalvation.(1528) Thus Paul, after an enumeration of all possible\nadversities, glories that they can never separate us from the love of God;\nand in his prayers, he always begins with the grace of God, from which all\nprosperity proceeds. David likewise opposes the Divine favour alone\nagainst all the terrors which disturb us: “Though I walk through the\nvalley of the shadow of death, (says he,) I will fear no evil, for thou\nart with me.”(1529) And we always feel our minds wavering, unless,\ncontented with the grace of God, they seek their peace in it, and are\ndeeply impressed with the sentiment of the Psalmist: “Blessed is the\nnation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his\nown inheritance.”(1530)\nXXIX. We make the foundation of faith to be the gratuitous promise; for on\nthat faith properly rests. For, although faith admits the veracity of God\nin all things, whether he command or prohibit, whether he promise or\nthreaten; though it obediently receives his injunctions, carefully\nobserves his prohibitions, and attends to his threatenings,—yet with the\npromise it properly begins, on that it stands, and in that it ends. For it\nseeks in God for life, which is found, not in precepts nor in\ndenunciations of punishments, but in the promise of mercy, and in that\nonly which is gratuitous; for a conditional promise, which sends us back\nto our own works, promises life to us only if we find it in ourselves.\nTherefore, if we wish our faith not to tremble and waver, we must support\nit with the promise of salvation, which is voluntarily and liberally\noffered us by the Lord, rather in consideration of our misery, than in\nrespect of our worthiness. Wherefore the apostle denominates the gospel\n“the word of faith;”(1531) a character which he denies both to the\nprecepts and to the promises of the law; since there is nothing that can\nestablish faith, but that liberal embassy by which God reconciles the\nworld to himself. Hence also the same apostle frequently connects faith\nwith the gospel; as when he states, that “the ministry of the gospel was\ncommitted to him for obedience to the faith;” that it is “the power of God\nunto salvation to every one that believeth;” that therein is the\n“righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.”(1532) Nor is this to\nbe wondered at; for the gospel being “the ministry of\nreconciliation,”(1533) there is no other sufficient testimony of the\nDivine benevolence towards us, the knowledge of which is necessary to\nfaith. When we assert, therefore, that faith rests on the gratuitous\npromise, we deny not that believers embrace and revere every part of the\nDivine word, but we point out the promise of mercy as the peculiar object\nof faith. Thus believers ought to acknowledge God as a judge and avenger\nof crimes; yet they fix their eyes peculiarly on his clemency; described\nfor their contemplation as “gracious and full of compassion; slow to\nanger, and of great mercy; good to all, and diffusing his tender mercies\nover all his works.”(1534)\nXXX. Nor do I regard the clamours of Pighius, or any such snarlers, who\ncensure this restriction, as though it divided faith, and comprehended\nonly one branch of it. I grant that, as I have already said, the general\nobject of faith (as they express themselves) is the veracity of God,\nwhether he threaten, or give us a hope of his grace. Wherefore the apostle\nattributes this to faith, that Noah feared the destruction of the world\nwhile it was yet unseen.(1535) If the fear of impending punishment was the\nwork of faith, threatenings ought not to be excluded from the definition\nof it. This indeed is true; but these cavillers unjustly charge us with\ndenying that faith respects every part of the word of God. For we only\nintend to establish these two points; first, that it never stands firmly\ntill it comes to the gratuitous promise; secondly, that we are reconciled\nto God only as it unites us to Christ. Both these points are worthy of\nobservation. We are inquiring for a faith which may distinguish the sons\nof God from the reprobate, and believers from unbelievers. If any man\nbelieves the justice of the Divine commands and the truth of the Divine\nthreatenings, must he therefore be called a believer? By no means.\nTherefore faith can have no stability, unless it be placed on the Divine\nmercy. Now, to what purpose do we argue concerning faith? Is it not that\nwe may understand the way of salvation? But how is faith saving, but by\ningrafting us into the body of Christ? There will be no absurdity, then,\nif, in the definition of it, we insist on its principal effect, and as a\ndifference, add to the genus that character which separates believers from\nunbelievers. In a word, these malevolent men have nothing to carp at in\nthis doctrine, without involving in the same reprehension with us, the\napostle Paul, who particularly styles the gospel “the word of\nfaith.”(1536)\nXXXI. Hence, again, we infer, what has been before stated, that the word\nis as necessary to faith, as the living root of the tree is to the fruit;\nbecause, according to David, none can trust in God but those who know his\nname.(1537) But this knowledge proceeds not from every man’s own\nimagination, but from the testimony which God himself gives of his own\ngoodness. This the same Psalmist confirms in another place: “Thy salvation\naccording to thy word.”(1538) Again: “Save me: I hoped in thy word.”(1539)\nWhere we must observe the relation of faith to the word, and that\nsalvation is the consequence of it. Yet we exclude not the Divine power,\nby a view of which, unless faith be supported, it will never ascribe to\nGod the honour that is due to him. Paul seems to relate a trifling or\nuninteresting circumstance concerning Abraham, when he says, that he was\npersuaded that God, who had promised him the blessed seed, “was able also\nto perform.”(1540) In another place, respecting himself he says, “I know\nwhom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which\nI have committed unto him against that day.”(1541) But if any one\nconsiders, how many doubts respecting the power of God frequently intrude\nthemselves, he will fully acknowledge, that they who magnify it as it\ndeserves, have made no small progress in faith. We shall all confess, that\nGod is able to do whatever he pleases; but whilst the smallest temptation\nstrikes us with consternation and terror, it is evident that we derogate\nfrom the Divine power, to which we prefer the menaces of Satan in\nopposition to the promises of God. This is the reason why Isaiah, when he\nwould impress the hearts of the people with an assurance of salvation,\ndiscourses in so magnificent a manner concerning the infinite power of\nGod. He frequently appears, after having begun to treat of the hope of\npardon and reconciliation, to digress to another subject, and to wander\nthrough prolix and unnecessary circumlocutions, celebrating the wonders of\nthe Divine government in the machine of heaven and earth, and the whole\norder of nature: yet there is nothing but what is applicable to the\npresent subject; for, unless the omnipotence of God be presented to our\neyes, our ears will not attend to his word, or not esteem it according to\nits worth. Moreover, the Scripture there speaks of his effectual power;\nfor piety, as we have elsewhere seen, always makes a useful and practical\napplication of the power of God; and particularly proposes to itself those\nof his works in which he has discovered himself as a father. Hence the\nfrequent mention of redemption in the Scriptures, from which the\nIsraelites might learn, that God, who had once been the author of\nsalvation, would be its everlasting preserver. David also teaches us by\nhis own example, that the private benefits which God has conferred on an\nindividual, conduce to the confirmation of his faith for the future: even\nwhen he seems to have deserted us, we ought to extend our views further,\nso as to derive encouragement from his ancient benefits, as it is said in\nanother psalm: “I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works,”\n&c.(1542) Again: “I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will\nremember thy wonders of old.”(1543) But since, without the word, all our\nconceptions of the power and works of God are unprofitable and transient,\nwe have sufficient reason for asserting, that there can be no faith,\nwithout the illumination of Divine grace. But here a question might be\nraised—What must be thought of Sarah and Rebecca, both of whom, apparently\nimpelled by the zeal of faith, transgressed the limits of the word? Sarah,\nwhen she ardently desired the promised son, gave her maid‐servant to her\nhusband. That she sinned in many respects, is not to be denied; but I now\nrefer to her error in being carried away by her zeal, and not restraining\nherself within the bounds of the Divine word. Yet it is certain, that this\ndesire proceeded from faith. Rebecca, having been divinely assured of the\nelection of her son Jacob, procures him the benediction by a sinful\nartifice; she deceives her husband, the witness and minister of the grace\nof God; she constrains her son to utter falsehoods; she corrupts the truth\nof God by various frauds and impostures; finally, by exposing his promise\nto ridicule, she does all in her power to destroy it. And yet this\ntransaction, however criminal and reprehensible, was not unaccompanied\nwith faith; because she had to overcome many obstacles, that she might\naspire earnestly to that which, without any expectation of worldly\nadvantage, was pregnant with great troubles and dangers. So we must not\npronounce the holy patriarch Isaac to be entirely destitute of faith,\nbecause, after having been divinely apprized of the translation of the\nhonour to his younger son, he nevertheless ceases not to be partial to\nEsau, his first‐born. These examples certainly teach that errors are\nfrequently mixed with faith, yet that faith, when real, always retains the\npreëminence. For, as the particular error of Rebecca did not annul the\neffect of the benediction, so neither did it destroy the faith which\ngenerally predominated in her mind, and was the principle and cause of\nthat action. Nevertheless, Rebecca, in this instance, has discovered how\nliable the human mind is to error, as soon as it allows itself the\nsmallest license. But though our deficiency or imbecility obscures faith,\nyet it does not extinguish it: in the mean time it reminds us how\nsolicitously we ought to attend to the declarations of God; and confirms\nwhat we have said, that faith decays unless it be supported by the word;\nas the minds of Sarah, Isaac, and Rebecca, would have been lost in their\nobliquities, if they had not, by the secret restraint of God, been kept in\nobedience to the word.\nXXXII. Again: it is not without reason that we include all the promises in\nChrist;(1544) as the apostle in the knowledge of him includes the whole\ngospel; and in another place teaches, that “all the promises of God in him\nare yea, and in him amen.”(1545) The reason of this is plain. For, if God\npromises any thing, he gives a proof of his benevolence; so that there is\nno promise of his which is not a testimony of his love. Nor does it affect\nthe argument, that the impious, when they are loaded with great and\ncontinual benefits from the Divine goodness, render themselves obnoxious\nto a heavier judgment. For since they neither think nor acknowledge that\nthey receive those things from the hand of the Lord,—or if ever they\nacknowledge it, yet they never reflect within themselves on his\ngoodness,—they cannot thereby be instructed concerning his mercy, any more\nthan the brutes, who, according to the circumstances of their condition,\nreceive the same effusion of his liberality, but never perceive it. Nor is\nit any more repugnant to our argument, that by generally rejecting the\npromises designed for them, they draw down on themselves severer\nvengeance. For although the efficacy of the promises is manifested only\nwhen they have obtained credit with us, yet their force and propriety are\nnever extinguished by our unbelief or ingratitude. Therefore, when the\nLord by his promises invites a man not only to receive, but also to\nmeditate on the effects of his goodness, he at the same time gives him a\ndeclaration of his love. Whence we must return to this principle, that\nevery promise is an attestation of the Divine love to us. But it is beyond\nall controversy, that no man is loved by God but in Christ;(1546) he is\nthe “beloved Son,” in whom the love of the Father perpetually rests, and\nthen from him diffuses itself to us; as Paul says, that we are “accepted\nin the beloved.”(1547) It must therefore be communicated to us by his\nmediation.(1548) Wherefore the apostle, in another place, calls him “our\npeace,”(1549) and elsewhere represents him as the bond by which God is\nunited to us in his paternal love. It follows, that whenever any promise\nis presented to us, our eyes must be directed to him; and that Paul is\ncorrect in stating, that all the promises of God are confirmed and\naccomplished in him.(1550) This is opposed by some examples. For it is not\ncredible that Naaman the Syrian, when he inquired of the prophet\nrespecting the right method of worshipping God,(1551) was instructed\nconcerning the Mediator; yet his piety is commended. Cornelius,(1552) a\nGentile and Roman, could scarcely be acquainted with what was not\nuniversally or clearly known among the Jews; yet his benefactions and\nprayers were acceptable to God; and the sacrifices of Naaman received the\napprobation of the prophet, which neither of these persons could have\nobtained without faith. Similar was the case of the eunuch to whom Philip\nwas conducted;(1553) who, unless he had been possessed of some faith,\nwould never have incurred the labour and expense of a long and difficult\njourney, for the sake of worshipping at Jerusalem. Yet we see how, on\nbeing interrogated by Philip, he betrayed his ignorance of the Mediator. I\nconfess, indeed, that their faith was in some measure implicit, not only\nwith respect to the person of Christ, but with respect to the power and\noffice assigned him by the Father. At the same time it is certain that\nthey had imbibed principles which afforded them some notion of Christ,\nhowever slight; nor should this be thought strange; for the eunuch would\nnot have hastened from a remote country to Jerusalem to adore an unknown\nGod; nor did Cornelius spend so much time, after having once embraced the\nJewish religion, without acquainting himself with the rudiments of sound\ndoctrine. With regard to Naaman, it would have been extremely absurd for\nElisha, who directed him concerning the minutest particulars, to have been\nsilent on the most important subject. Although their knowledge of Christ,\ntherefore, was obscure, yet to suppose that they had none is unreasonable;\nbecause they practised the sacrifices of the law, which must have been\ndistinguished by their end, that is, Christ, from the illegitimate\nsacrifices of the heathen.\nXXXIII. This simple and external demonstration of the Divine word ought,\nindeed, to be fully sufficient for the production of faith, if it were not\nobstructed by our blindness and perverseness. But such is our propensity\nto error, that our mind can never adhere to Divine truth; such is our\ndulness, that we can never discern the light of it. Therefore nothing is\neffected by the word, without the illumination of the Holy Spirit. Whence\nit appears, that faith is far superior to human intelligence. Nor is it\nenough for the mind to be illuminated by the Spirit of God, unless the\nheart also be strengthened and supported by his power. On this point, the\nschoolmen are altogether erroneous, who, in the discussion of faith,\nregard it as a simple assent of the understanding, entirely neglecting the\nconfidence and assurance of the heart. Faith, therefore, is a singular\ngift of God in two respects; both as the mind is enlightened to understand\nthe truth of God, and as the heart is established in it. For the Holy\nSpirit not only originates faith, but increases it by degrees, till he\nconducts us by it all the way to the heavenly kingdom. “That good thing,”\nsays Paul, “which was committed unto thee, keep, by the Holy Ghost which\ndwelleth in us.”(1554) If it be urged, that Paul declares the Spirit to be\ngiven to us “by the hearing of faith,”(1555) this objection is easily\nanswered. If there were only one gift of the Spirit, it would be absurd to\nrepresent the Spirit as the effect of faith, of which he is the author and\ncause; but when the apostle is treating of the gifts with which God adorns\nhis Church, to lead it, by advancements in faith, forwards to perfection,\nwe need not wonder that he ascribes those gifts to faith, which prepares\nus for their reception. It is accounted by the world exceedingly\nparadoxical, when it is affirmed, that no one can believe in Christ, but\nhe to whom it is given. But this is partly for want of considering the\ndepth and sublimity of heavenly wisdom, and the extreme dulness of man in\napprehending the mysteries of God, and partly from not regarding that firm\nand steadfast constancy of heart, which is the principal branch of faith.\nXXXIV. But if, as Paul tells us, no one is acquainted with the will of a\nman but “the spirit of a man which is in him,”(1556) how could man be\ncertain of the will of God? And if we are uncertain respecting the truth\nof God in those things which are the subjects of our present\ncontemplation, how should we have a greater certainty of it, when the Lord\npromises such things as no eye sees and no heart conceives? Human sagacity\nis here so completely lost, that the first step to improvement, in the\nDivine school, is to forsake it. For, like an interposing veil,(1557) it\nprevents us from discovering the mysteries of God, which are revealed only\nto babes.(1558) “For flesh and blood hath not revealed,”(1559) and “the\nnatural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are\nfoolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are\nspiritually discerned.”(1560) The aids of the Spirit therefore are\nnecessary, or rather it is his influence alone that is efficacious here.\n“Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his\ncounsellor?”(1561) but “the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep\nthings of God;”(1562) and through him, “we have the mind of Christ.”(1563)\n“No man can come to me (says he) except the Father, which hath sent me,\ndraw him. Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the\nFather, cometh unto me. Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he\nwhich is of God.” Therefore, as we can never come to Christ, unless we are\ndrawn by the Spirit of God, so when we are drawn, we are raised both in\nmind and in heart above the reach of our own understanding. For\nilluminated by him, the soul receives, as it were, new eyes for the\ncontemplation of heavenly mysteries, by the splendour of which it was\nbefore dazzled. And thus the human intellect, irradiated by the light of\nthe Holy Spirit, then begins to relish those things which pertain to the\nkingdom of God, for which before it had not the smallest taste. Wherefore\nChrist’s two disciples receive no benefit from his excellent discourse to\nthem on the mysteries of his kingdom,(1564) till he opens their\nunderstanding that they may understand the Scriptures. Thus, though the\napostles were taught by his Divine mouth, yet the Spirit of Truth must be\nsent to them, to instil into their minds the doctrine which they had heard\nwith their ears.(1565) The word of God is like the sun shining on all to\nwhom it is preached; but without any benefit to the blind. But in this\nrespect we are all blind by nature; therefore it cannot penetrate into our\nminds, unless the internal teacher, the Spirit, make way for it by his\nillumination.\nXXXV. In a former part of this work, relating to the corruption of nature,\nwe have shown more at large the inability of men to believe; therefore I\nshall not fatigue the reader by a repetition of the same things. Let it\nsuffice that faith itself, which we possess not by nature, but which is\ngiven us by the Spirit, is called by Paul “the spirit of faith.”(1566)\nTherefore he prays “that God would fulfil,” in the Thessalonians, “all the\ngood pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power.”(1567) By\ncalling faith “the work” of God, and “the good pleasure of his goodness,”\nhe denies it to be the proper effect of human exertion; and not content\nwith that, he adds that it is a specimen of the Divine power. When he says\nto the Corinthians, that faith stands “not in the wisdom of men, but in\nthe power of God,”(1568) he speaks indeed of external miracles; but\nbecause the reprobate have no eyes to behold them, he comprehends also the\ninward seal which he elsewhere mentions. And that he may more\nillustriously display his liberality in so eminent a gift, God deigns not\nto bestow it promiscuously on all, but by a singular privilege imparts it\nto whom he will. We have already cited testimonies to prove this point.\nAugustine, who is a faithful expositor of them, says, “It was in order to\nteach us that the act of believing is owing to the Divine gift, not to\nhuman merit, that our Saviour declared, ‘No man can come to me, except the\nFather which hath sent me draw him;(1569) and except it were given unto\nhim of my Father.’(1570) It is wonderful, that two persons hear; one\ndespises, the other ascends. Let him who despises, impute it to himself;\nlet him who ascends, not arrogate it to himself.” In another place he\nsays, “Wherefore is it given to one, not to another? I am not ashamed to\nreply, This is a depth of the cross. From I know not what depth of the\nDivine judgments, which we cannot scrutinize, proceeds all our ability.\nThat I can, I see; whence I can, I see not; unless that I see thus far,\nthat it is of God. But why one, and not another? It is too much for me; it\nis an abyss, a depth of the cross. I can exclaim with admiration, but not\ndemonstrate it in disputation.” The sum of the whole is this—that Christ,\nwhen he illuminates us with faith by the power of his Spirit, at the same\ntime ingrafts us into his body, that we may become partakers of all his\nbenefits.\nXXXVI. It next remains, that what the mind has imbibed, be transfused into\nthe heart. For the word of God is not received by faith, if it floats on\nthe surface of the brain; but when it has taken deep root in the heart, so\nas to become an impregnable fortress to sustain and repel all the assaults\nof temptation. But if it be true that the right apprehension of the mind\nproceeds from the illumination of the Spirit, his energy is far more\nconspicuous in such a confirmation of the heart; the diffidence of the\nheart being greater than the blindness of the mind; and the furnishing of\nthe heart with assurance being more difficult than the communication of\nknowledge to the understanding. Therefore the Spirit acts as a seal, to\nseal on our hearts those very promises, the certainty of which he has\npreviously impressed on our minds, and serves as an earnest to confirm and\nestablish them. “After that ye believed,” says the apostle, “ye were\nsealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our\ninheritance.”(1571) Do you see how he shows that the hearts of believers\nare impressed by the Spirit, as by a seal? How, for this reason, he calls\nhim “the Spirit of promise,” because he ratifies the gospel to us? So, to\nthe Corinthians, he says, “He which hath anointed us, is God; who hath\nalso sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.”(1572)\nAnd in another place, where he speaks of the confidence and boldness of\nhope, he makes “the earnest of the Spirit”(1573) the foundation of it.\nXXXVII. I have not forgotten what I have already observed, and the\nremembrance of which experience incessantly renews, that faith is agitated\nwith various doubts; so that the minds of the pious are seldom at ease, or\nat best enjoy not a state of perpetual tranquillity. But whatever assaults\nthey may sustain, they either emerge from the very gulf of temptation, or\nremain firm in their station. This assurance alone nourishes and supports\nfaith, while we are satisfied of what is declared by the Psalmist, “God is\nour refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will we\nnot fear, though the earth be removed, and the mountains be carried into\nthe midst of the sea.”(1574) This most delightful repose is celebrated\nalso in another psalm: “I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord\nsustained me.”(1575) Not that David enjoyed a happy cheerfulness of soul\nperpetually flowing on in one even tenor; but having tasted the grace of\nGod according to the proportion of his faith, he glories in intrepidly\ndespising whatever could disquiet the peace of his mind. Therefore the\nScripture, intending to exhort us to faith, commands us to “be quiet.” In\nIsaiah, “In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.”(1576) In\nthe Psalms, “Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.”(1577) With\nwhich corresponds the observation of the apostle to the Hebrews, “Ye have\nneed of patience.”(1578)\nXXXVIII. Hence we may judge, how pernicious that dogma of the schoolmen\nis, that it is impossible to decide concerning the favour of God towards\nus, any otherwise than from moral conjecture, as every individual may deem\nhimself not unworthy of it. If it must be determined by our works how the\nLord is affected towards us, I admit we cannot attain this object even by\na very slight conjecture; but as faith ought to correspond to the simple\nand gratuitous promise, there remains no room for doubting. For with what\nconfidence, pray, shall we be armed, if we reason that God is propitious\nto us on this condition, provided the purity of our life deserve it? But\nhaving determined on a separate discussion of these points, I shall pursue\nthem no further at present; especially since it is manifest that nothing\nis more opposite to faith than either conjecture or any thing else\napproaching to doubt. And they very mischievously pervert to this purpose\nthe observation of the Preacher, which is frequently in their mouths: “No\nman knoweth whether he is worthy of hatred or of love.”(1579) For not to\nobserve that this passage is falsely rendered in the Vulgate translation,\nyet the meaning of Solomon, in such expressions, must be clear even to\nchildren; it is, that if any one wishes, from the present state of things,\nto judge who are the objects of Divine love or hatred, he labours in vain,\nand distresses himself to no good purpose; since “there is one event to\nthe righteous and to the wicked; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that\nsacrificeth not.”(1580) Whence it follows that God neither testifies his\nlove to those whom he prospers with success, nor invariably discovers his\nhatred against those whom he plunges into affliction. And this observation\nis designed to reprove the vanity of the human understanding; since it is\nso extremely stupid respecting things most necessary to be known. He had\njust before said, “That which befalleth the sons of men, befalleth beasts;\nas the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so\nthat a man hath no preëminence above a beast.”(1581) If any one would\ninfer from this, that the opinion which we hold of the immortality of the\nsoul rests upon mere conjecture, would he not be deservedly deemed insane?\nAre those persons, then, in a state of sanity, who conclude that there is\nno certainty of the favour of God, because it cannot be attained from the\ncarnal contemplation of present things?\nXXXIX. But they plead that it is rash presumption in men to arrogate to\nthemselves an undoubted knowledge of the Divine will. This, indeed, I\nwould concede to them, if we pretended to subject the incomprehensible\ncounsel of God to the slenderness of our understanding. But when we simply\nassert with Paul, that “we have received, not the spirit of the world, but\nthe Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely\ngiven to us of God,”(1582) what opposition can they make to us, without at\nthe same time insulting the Spirit of God? But if it be a horrible\nsacrilege to accuse the revelation which proceeds from him either of\nfalsehood, or of uncertainty, or of ambiguity, wherein do we err in\naffirming its certainty? But they exclaim, that we betray great temerity,\nin thus presuming to boast of the Spirit of Christ. Who could believe the\nstupidity of men desirous of being esteemed teachers of the world, to be\nso extreme as to stumble in this shameful manner at the first elements of\nreligion? It would certainly be incredible to me, if it were not proved by\nthe writings which they have published. Paul pronounces them alone to be\nthe sons of God, who are led by his Spirit:(1583) these men will have\nthose who are the sons of God to be led by their own spirit, but to be\ndestitute of the Spirit of God. He teaches, that we call God our Father at\nthe suggestion of the Spirit, who “beareth witness with our spirit, that\nwe are the children of God:”(1584) these men, though they forbid not all\ninvocation of God, yet deprive us of the Spirit, by whose influence alone\nhe can be rightly invoked. He denies them to be the servants of Christ,\nwho are not led by the Spirit of Christ:(1585) these men invent a sort of\nChristianity, to which the Spirit of Christ is not necessary. He admits no\nhope of a happy resurrection, unless we experience the Spirit dwelling in\nus:(1586) these men fabricate a hope unattended by such experience. But\nperhaps they will answer, that they deny not the necessity of our being\nendued with the Spirit; but that it is the part of modesty and humility\nnot to acknowledge our possession of him. What, then, is the meaning of\nthe apostle in this exhortation to the Corinthians—“Examine yourselves,\nwhether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves; know ye not yourselves,\nhow that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?”(1587) But says\nJohn, “We know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given\nus.”(1588) And do we not call in question the promises of Christ, when we\nwish to be accounted the servants of God without the possession of his\nSpirit, whom he has announced that he will pour out upon all his\npeople?(1589) Do we not injure the Holy Spirit, if we separate faith from\nhim, which is his peculiar work? These being the first rudiments of piety,\nit is a proof of most miserable blindness, that Christians are censured as\narrogant for presuming to glory in the presence of the Holy Spirit,\nwithout which glorying Christianity itself cannot exist. But they\nexemplify the truth of Christ’s assertion, “The world knoweth not the\nSpirit of truth; but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be\nin you.”(1590)\nXL. Not satisfied with one attempt to destroy the stability of faith, they\nassail it again from another quarter; by arguing, that although we may\nform a judgment concerning the favour of God from the present state of our\nrighteousness, yet the knowledge of final perseverance remains in\nsuspense. Truly we are left in possession of an admirable confidence of\nsalvation, if we can only conclude from mere conjecture that we are in the\nfavour of God at the present instant, but are utterly ignorant what may be\nour fate to‐morrow. The apostle expresses a very different opinion: “I am\npersuaded (says he) that neither life, nor death, nor angels, nor\nprincipalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor\nheight, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us\nfrom the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”(1591) They\nattempt to evade the force of this, by a frivolous pretence that the\napostle had it from a particular revelation; but they are too closely\npressed to avail themselves of this evasion. For he is there treating of\nthe benefits resulting from faith to all believers in common, not of any\nwhich were peculiar to his own experience. But the same apostle, they say,\nin another place, excites fear in us, by the mention of our imbecility and\ninconstancy. “Let him (says he) that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest\nhe fall.”(1592) It is true; but not a fear by which we may be thrown into\nconsternation, but from which we may learn to “humble ourselves,” as Peter\nexpresses it, “under the mighty hand of God.” Besides, how preposterous is\nit to limit to a moment of time the assurance of faith, whose nature it is\nto go beyond the bounds of the present life, and reach forward to a future\nimmortality! Since believers, then, ascribe it to the grace of God that\nthey are illuminated by his Spirit, and enjoy through faith a\ncontemplation of the heavenly life, such a glorying is so remote from\narrogance, that, if any one be ashamed to confess it, he rather betrays\nextreme ingratitude by a criminal suppression of the Divine goodness, than\ngives an evidence of modesty or humility.\nXLI. Because we thought that the nature of faith could not be better or\nmore clearly expressed than by the substance of the promise, which is the\nproper foundation on which it rests, and the removal of which would\noccasion its fall or annihilation,—it is from the promise, therefore, that\nwe have taken our definition, which, nevertheless, is not at all at\nvariance with that definition, or rather description, of the apostle,\nwhich he accommodates to his argument; where he says, that “faith is the\nsubstance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”(1593) For\nby ὑποστασις, which is the word he uses, and which is rendered substance,\nhe intends a prop, as it were, on which the pious mind rests and reclines;\nas though he had said, that faith is a certain and secure possession of\nthose things which are promised to us by God. Unless any one would rather\nunderstand ὑποστασις of confidence, to which I shall not object, though I\nadopt that idea which is the more generally received. Again: to signify\nthat even till the last day, when the books shall be opened, these objects\nare too sublime to be perceived by our senses, seen with our eyes, or\nhandled with our hands; and that, in the mean time, they are enjoyed by us\nonly as we exceed the capacity of our own understanding, extend our views\nbeyond all terrestrial things, and even rise above ourselves; he has\nadded, that this security of possession relates to things which are the\nobjects of hope, and therefore invisible. For “hope that is seen (as Paul\nobserves) is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope\nfor?”(1594) But when he calls it an evidence, or proof, or (as Augustine\nhas frequently rendered it) a conviction of things not seen, (for the\nGreek word is ἐλεγχος,) it is just as though he had called it the evidence\nof things not apparent, the vision of things not seen, the perspicuity of\nthings obscure, the presence of things absent, the demonstration of things\nconcealed. For the mysteries of God, of which description are the things\nthat pertain to our salvation, cannot be discerned in themselves, and in\ntheir own nature; we only discover them in his word, of whose veracity we\nought to be so firmly persuaded, as to consider all that he speaks as\nthough it were already performed and accomplished. But how can the mind\nelevate itself to receive such a taste of the Divine goodness, without\nbeing all inflamed with mutual love to God? For the plenitude of\nhappiness, which God has reserved for them who fear him, cannot be truly\nknown, but it must at the same time excite a vehement affection. And those\nwhom it has once affected, it draws and elevates towards itself. Therefore\nwe need not wonder if a perverse and malicious heart never feel this\naffection, which conducts us to heaven itself, and introduces us to the\nmost secret treasures of God and the most sacred recesses of his kingdom,\nwhich must not be profaned by the entrance of an impure heart. For what\nthe schoolmen(1595) advance concerning the priority of charity to faith\nand hope, is a mere reverie of a distempered imagination, since it is\nfaith alone which first produces charity in us. How much more accurately\nBernard speaks! “I believe,” says he, “that the testimony of conscience,\nwhich Paul calls the rejoicing of the pious, consists in three things. For\nit is necessary to believe, first of all, that you cannot have remission\nof sins but through the mercy of God; secondly, that you cannot have any\ngood work, unless he bestow this also; lastly, that you cannot by any\nworks merit eternal life, unless that also be freely given.”(1596) Just\nafter he adds, “that these things are not sufficient, but are a beginning\nof faith; because in believing that sins can only be forgiven by God, we\nought at the same time to consider that they are forgiven us, till we are\nalso persuaded, by the testimony of the Holy Spirit, that salvation is\nlaid up for us; because God forgives sins; he also bestows merits; he\nlikewise confers rewards; it is not possible to remain in this beginning.”\nBut these and other things must be treated in the proper places; it may\nsuffice, at present, to ascertain wherein faith itself consists.\nXLII. Now, wherever this living faith shall be found, it must necessarily\nbe attended with the hope of eternal salvation as its inseparable\nconcomitant, or rather must originate and produce it; since the want of\nthis hope would prove us to be utterly destitute of faith, however\neloquently and beautifully we might discourse concerning it. For if faith\nbe, as has been stated, a certain persuasion of the truth of God, that it\ncan neither lie, nor deceive us, nor be frustrated,—they who have felt\nthis assurance, likewise expect a period to arrive when God will\naccomplish his promises, which, according to their persuasion, cannot but\nbe true; so that, in short, hope is no other than an expectation of those\nthings which faith has believed to be truly promised by God. Thus faith\nbelieves the veracity of God, hope expects the manifestation of it in due\ntime; faith believes him to be our Father, hope expects him always to act\ntowards us in this character; faith believes that eternal life is given to\nus, hope expects it one day to be revealed; faith is the foundation on\nwhich hope rests, hope nourishes and sustains faith. For as no man can\nhave any expectations from God, but he who has first believed his\npromises, so also the imbecility of our faith must be sustained and\ncherished by patient hope and expectation, lest it grow weary and faint.\nFor which reason, Paul rightly places our salvation in hope.(1597) For\nhope, while it is silently expecting the Lord, restrains faith, that it\nmay not be too precipitate; it confirms faith, that it may not waver in\nthe Divine promises, or begin to doubt of the truth of them; it refreshes\nit, that it may not grow weary; it extends it to the farthest goal, that\nit may not fail in the midst of the course, or even at the entrance of it.\nFinally, hope, by continually renewing and restoring faith, causes it\nfrequently to persevere with more vigour than hope itself. But in how many\ncases the assistance of hope is necessary to the establishment of faith,\nwill better appear, if we consider how many species of temptations assail\nand harass those who have embraced the word of God. First, the Lord, by\ndeferring the execution of his promises, frequently keeps our minds in\nsuspense longer than we wish; here it is the office of hope to obey the\ninjunction of the prophet—“though it tarry, wait for it.”(1598) Sometimes\nhe not only suffers us to languish, but openly manifests his indignation:\nin this case it is much more necessary to have the assistance of hope,\nthat, according to the language of another prophet, we may “wait upon the\nLord that hideth his face from Jacob.”(1599) Scoffers also arise, as Peter\nsays, and inquire, “Where is the promise of his coming? for since the\nfathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning\nof the creation.”(1600) And the flesh and the world whisper the same\nthings into our ears. Here faith must be supported by the patience of\nhope, and kept fixed on the contemplation of eternity, that it may\nconsider “a thousand years as one day.”(1601)\nXLIII. On account of this union and affinity, the Scripture sometimes uses\nthe words faith and hope without any distinction. For when Peter says that\nwe “are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be\nrevealed,”(1602) he attributes to faith, what was more applicable to hope;\nand not without reason, since we have already shown, that hope is no other\nthan the nourishment and strength of faith. Sometimes they are joined\ntogether, as in a passage of the same Epistle—“that your faith and hope\nmight be in God.”(1603) But Paul, in the Epistle to the Philippians,(1604)\ndeduces expectation from hope; because in patient hope we suspend our\ndesires till the arrival of God’s appointed time. All which may be better\nunderstood from the tenth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews,(1605)\nwhich I have already cited. In another place, Paul, though with some\nimpropriety of expression, conveys the very same idea in these words: “We,\nthrough the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith;”(1606)\nbecause, having embraced the testimony of the gospel concerning his\ngratuitous love, we wait till God openly manifests what is now concealed\nunder hope. Now, it is easy to see the absurdity of Peter Lombard, in\nlaying a twofold foundation of hope; the grace of God, and the merit of\nworks. Hope can have no other object than faith; and the only object of\nfaith, we have very clearly stated to be the mercy of God; to which both\nits eyes, if I may be allowed the expression, ought to be directed. But it\nmay be proper to hear what kind of a reason he advances. If, says he, you\nventure to hope for any thing without merits, it must not be called hope,\nbut presumption. Who is there that will not justly detest such teachers,\nwho pronounce a confidence in the veracity of God to be temerity and\npresumption? For whereas it is the will of the Lord that we should expect\nevery thing from his goodness, they assert that it is presumption to\ndepend and rely upon it. Such a master is worthy of such disciples as he\nhas found in the schools of wranglers! But, as for us, since we see that\nsinners are enjoined by the oracles of God to entertain a hope of\nsalvation, let us joyfully presume so far on his veracity as to reject all\nconfidence in our own works, to depend solely on his mercy, and venture to\ncherish a hope of happiness. He who said, “According to your faith be it\nunto you,”(1607) will not deceive us."

          "title": "Chapter III. On Repentance.",
          "content": "Though we have already shown, in some respect, how faith possesses Christ,\nand how by means of faith we enjoy his benefits, yet the subject would\nstill be involved in obscurity, unless we were to add a description of the\neffects which we experience. The substance of the gospel is, not without\nreason, said to be comprised in “repentance and remission of sins.”\nTherefore, if these two points be omitted, every controversy concerning\nfaith will be jejune and incomplete, and consequently of little use. Now,\nsince both are conferred on us by Christ, and we obtain both by\nfaith,—that is, newness of life and gratuitous reconciliation,—the regular\nmethod of instruction requires me, in this place, to enter on the\ndiscussion of both. But our immediate transition will be from faith to\nrepentance; because, when this point is well understood, it will better\nappear how man is justified by faith alone, and mere pardon, and yet that\nreal sanctity of life (so to speak) is not separated from the gratuitous\nimputation of righteousness. Now, it ought not to be doubted that\nrepentance not only immediately follows faith, but is produced by it. For\nsince pardon, or remission, is offered by the preaching of the gospel, in\norder that the sinner, liberated from the tyranny of Satan, from the yoke\nof sin, and the miserable servitude of his vices, may remove into the\nkingdom of God,—no one can embrace the grace of the gospel, but he must\ndepart from the errors of his former life, enter into the right way, and\ndevote all his attention to the exercise of repentance. Those who imagine\nthat repentance rather precedes faith, than is produced by it, as fruit by\na tree, have never been acquainted with its power, and are induced to\nadopt that sentiment by a very insufficient argument.\nII. They argue that Jesus Christ and John the Baptist, in their preaching,\nfirst exhort the people to repentance; and afterwards add, that “the\nkingdom of heaven is at hand;”(1608) that thus the apostles were commanded\nto preach, and that this (according to the account of Luke)(1609) was the\nmethod followed by Paul. But they superstitiously attend to the connection\nof the syllables, and disregard the sense and coherence of the words. For\nwhen Christ and John preach in this manner, “Repent, for the kingdom of\nheaven is at hand,”(1610) do they not derive an argument for repentance\nfrom grace itself, and the promise of salvation? The meaning of their\nlanguage, therefore, is just as though they had said, Since the kingdom of\nheaven is at hand, therefore repent. For Matthew, having related that John\npreached in this manner, informs us, that in him was accomplished the\nprediction of Isaiah concerning “the voice of one crying in the\nwilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” But,\nin the prophet, that voice is commanded to begin with consolation and glad\ntidings.(1611) Yet, when we speak of faith as the origin of repentance, we\ndream not of any space of time which it employs in producing it; but we\nintend to signify, that a man cannot truly devote himself to repentance,\nunless he knows himself to be of God. Now, no man is truly persuaded that\nhe is of God, except he has previously received his grace. But these\nthings will be more clearly discussed as we proceed. This circumstance,\nperhaps, has deceived them—that many are overcome or led to obedience by\nterrors of conscience, before they have imbibed a knowledge of grace, or\nhave even tasted it. And this is the initial fear, which some number among\nthe graces, because they perceive it to be nearly connected with true and\nrighteous obedience. But we are not inquiring, at present, in how many\nways Christ draws us to himself, or prepares us for the practice of piety:\nonly I assert, that no rectitude can be found but where that Spirit\nreigns, whom he has received in order to communicate him to his members.\nIn the next place, according to this passage in the Psalms, “There is\nforgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared,”(1612) no man will ever\nreverence God, but he who confides in his being propitious to him: no man\nwill cheerfully devote himself to the observance of his law, but he who is\npersuaded that his services are pleasing to him: and this indulgence in\npardoning us, and bearing with our faults, is an evidence of his paternal\nfavour. The same also appears from this exhortation of Hosea, “Come, and\nlet us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he\nhath smitten, and he will bind us up;”(1613) because the hope of pardon is\nadded as a stimulus, to prevent them from being stupefied in their sins.\nBut there is not the least appearance of reason in the notion of those\nwho, in order to begin with repentance, prescribe to their young converts\ncertain days, during which they must exercise themselves in repentance;\nafter the expiration of which, they admit them to the communion of\nevangelical grace. I speak of many of the Anabaptists, especially of those\nwho wonderfully delight in being accounted spiritual; and their\ncompanions, the Jesuits, and other such worthless men. Such are the\neffects produced by that spirit of fanaticism, that it terminates\nrepentance within the limits of a few short days, which a Christian ought\nto extend throughout his whole life.\nIII. But concerning repentance, some learned men, in times very remote\nfrom the present, desiring to express themselves with simplicity and\nsincerity according to the rule of the Scripture, have said that it\nconsists of two parts—mortification and vivification. Mortification they\nexplain to be the sorrow of the mind, and the terror experienced from a\nknowledge of sin and a sense of the Divine judgments. For when any one has\nbeen brought to a true knowledge of sin, he then begins truly to hate and\nabhor it; then he is heartily displeased with himself, confesses himself\nto be miserable and lost, and wishes that he were another man. Moreover,\nwhen he is affected with some sense of the Divine judgment, (for the one\nimmediately follows the other,) then, indeed, he is stricken with\nconsternation, he trembles with humility and dejection, he feels a\ndespondency of mind, he falls into despair. This is the first part of\nrepentance, which they have generally styled contrition. Vivification they\nexplain to be the consolation which is produced by faith; when a man,\nafter having been humbled with a consciousness of sin, and stricken with\nthe fear of God, afterwards contemplates the goodness of God, and the\nmercy, grace, and salvation bestowed through Christ, rises from his\ndepression, feels himself re‐invigorated, recovers his courage, and as it\nwere returns from death to life. These terms, provided they be rightly\nunderstood, are sufficiently adapted to express the nature of repentance;\nbut when they explain vivification of that joy which the mind experiences\nafter its perturbations and fears are allayed, I cannot coincide with\nthem; since it should rather signify an ardent desire and endeavour to\nlive a holy and pious life, as though it were said, that a man dies to\nhimself, that he may begin to live to God.\nIV. Others, perceiving this word to have various acceptations in\nScripture, have laid down two kinds of repentance; and, to distinguish\nthem by some character, have called one Legal; in which the sinner,\nwounded by the envenomed dart of sin, and harassed by the fear of Divine\nwrath, is involved in deep distress, without the power of extricating\nhimself: the other they style Evangelical; in which the sinner is\ngrievously afflicted in himself, but rises above his distress, and\nembraces Christ as the medicine for his wound, the consolation of his\nterrors, and his refuge from all misery. Of legal repentance, they\nconsider Cain, Saul, and Judas, as examples;(1614) the scriptural account\nof whose repentance gives us to understand, that from a knowledge of the\ngreatness of their sins they dreaded the Divine wrath, but that\nconsidering God only as an avenger and a judge, they perished under that\napprehension. Their repentance, therefore, was only, as it were, the\nantechamber of hell, which having already entered in this life, they began\nto suffer punishment from the manifestation of the wrath of the Divine\nMajesty. Evangelical repentance we discover in all who have been\ndistressed by a sense of sin in themselves, but have been raised from\ntheir depression, and reinvigorated by a confidence in the Divine mercy,\nand converted to the Lord. Hezekiah was terrified when he received the\nmessage of death;(1615) but he wept and prayed, and, contemplating the\ngoodness of God, recovered his former confidence. The Ninevites were\nconfounded by the terrible denunciation of destruction;(1616) but they\ncovered themselves with sackcloth and ashes, and prayed, in hope that the\nLord might be appeased, and the fury of his wrath averted. David confessed\nthat he had committed a great sin in numbering the people; but added, “O\nLord, take away the iniquity of thy servant.”(1617) He acknowledged his\ncrime of adultery at the rebuke of Nathan, and prostrated himself before\nthe Lord; but at the same time cherished an expectation of pardon.(1618)\nSuch was the repentance of those who felt compunction of heart at the\npreaching of Peter, but, confiding in the goodness of God, exclaimed, “Men\nand brethren, what shall we do?”(1619) Such also was that of Peter\nhimself, who wept bitterly, but never lost his hope.\nV. Though all these observations are true, yet the term repentance, as far\nas I can ascertain from the Scriptures, must have a different acceptation.\nFor to include faith in repentance, is repugnant to what Paul says in the\nActs—that he testified “both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,\nrepentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ;”(1620)\nwhere he mentions faith and repentance, as two things totally distinct.\nWhat then? Can true repentance exist without faith? Not at all. But though\nthey cannot be separated, yet they ought to be distinguished. As faith\nexists not without hope, and yet there is a difference between them, so\nrepentance and faith, although they are perpetually and indissolubly\nunited, require to be connected rather than confounded. I am well aware,\nthat under the term _repentance_ is comprehended a complete conversion to\nGod, of which faith is one of the principal branches; but in what sense,\nwill best appear from an explication of its nature and properties. The\nHebrew word for repentance denotes conversion or return. The Greek word\nsignifies change of mind and intention. Repentance itself corresponds very\nwell with both etymologies, for it comprehends these two things—that,\nforsaking ourselves, we should turn to God, and laying aside our old mind,\nshould assume a new one. Wherefore I conceive it may be justly defined to\nbe “_a true conversion of our life to God, proceeding from a sincere and\nserious fear of God, and consisting in the mortification of our flesh and\nof the old man, and in the vivification of the Spirit_.” In this sense we\nmust understand all the addresses, in which either the prophets in ancient\ndays, or the apostles in a succeeding age, exhorted their contemporaries\nto repentance. For the point to which they endeavoured to bring them was\nthis—that being confounded by their sins, and penetrated with a fear of\nthe Divine judgment, they might prostrate themselves in humility before\nhim against whom they had offended, and with true penitence return into\nhis right way. Therefore these expressions, “_to repent_”(1621) and “_to\nreturn to the Lord_,”(1622) are promiscuously used by them in the same\nsignification. Hence also the sacred history expresses repentance by\n_seeking after_ and _following God_, when men who have disregarded him,\nand indulged their criminal propensities, begin to obey his word, and are\nready to follow whithersoever he calls them. And John and Paul have spoken\nof “bringing forth fruits meet for repentance,” to signify a life which,\nin every action, will discover and testify such a repentance.\nVI. But before we proceed any further, it will be useful to amplify and\nexplain the definition we have given; in which there are three points to\nbe particularly considered. In the first place, when we call repentance “a\nconversion of the life to God,” we require a transformation, not only in\nthe external actions, but in the soul itself; which, after having put off\nits old nature, should produce the fruits of actions corresponding to its\nrenovation. The prophet, intending to express this idea, commands those\nwhom he calls to repentance, to make themselves a new heart.(1623)\nWherefore Moses, when about to show how the Israelites might repent and be\nrightly converted to the Lord, frequently teaches them that it must be\ndone with all their heart, and with all their soul; and by speaking of the\ncircumcision of the heart, he enters into the inmost affections of the\nmind. This mode of expression we find often repeated by the prophets; but\nthere is no passage from which we may obtain clearer ideas of the true\nnature of repentance, than from the language of God in the fourth chapter\nof Jeremiah: “If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto\nme. Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. Circumcise\nyourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart.”(1624)\nObserve how he denounces that they shall labour in vain in the pursuit of\nrighteousness, unless impiety be previously eradicated from the bottom of\ntheir hearts. And in order to make a deeper impression upon them, he\napprizes them that they have to do with God, with whom subterfuges are of\nno avail, because he abhors all duplicity of heart. For this reason,\nIsaiah ridicules the preposterous endeavours of hypocrites, who did indeed\nstrenuously attempt an external repentance by the observance of\nceremonies, but at the same time were not concerned “to loose the bands of\nwickedness,”(1625) with which they oppressed the poor. In that passage he\nalso beautifully shows, in what duties unfeigned repentance properly\nconsists.\nVII. In the second place, we represented repentance as proceeding from a\nserious fear of God. For before the mind of a sinner can be inclined to\nrepentance, it must be excited by a knowledge of the Divine judgment. But\nwhen this thought has once been deeply impressed, that God will one day\nascend his tribunal to exact an account of all words and actions, it will\nnot permit the miserable man to take any interval of rest, or to enjoy\neven a momentary respite, but perpetually stimulates him to adopt a new\ncourse of life, that he may be able to appear with security at that\njudgment. Wherefore the Scripture, when it exhorts to repentance,\nfrequently introduces a mention of the judgment; as in Jeremiah; “Lest my\nfury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of\nthe evil of your doings:”(1626) in the address of Paul to the Athenians;\n“The times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men\nevery where to repent; because he hath appointed a day in which he will\njudge the world in righteousness:”(1627) and in many other places.\nSometimes, by the punishments already inflicted, it declares that God is a\njudge; in order that sinners may consider with themselves that worse\ncalamities await them, unless they speedily repent. We have an example of\nthis in the twenty‐ninth chapter of Deuteronomy. But since conversion\ncommences with a dread and hatred of sin, therefore the apostle makes\ngodly sorrow the cause of repentance.(1628) He calls it godly sorrow when\nwe not only dread punishment, but hate and abhor sin itself, from a\nknowledge that it is displeasing to God. Nor ought this to be thought\nstrange; for, unless we felt sharp compunction, our carnal sluggishness\ncould never be corrected, and even these distresses of mind would not be\nsufficient to arouse it from its stupidity and indolence, if God, by the\ninfliction of his chastisements, did not make a deeper impression. Beside\nthis, there is a rebellious obstinacy, which requires violent blows, as it\nwere, to overcome it. The severity, therefore, which God uses in his\nthreatenings, is extorted from him by the depravity of our minds; since it\nwould be in vain for him to address kind and alluring invitations to those\nwho are asleep. I forbear to recite the testimonies with which the\nScripture abounds. The fear of God is called the beginning of repentance\nalso for another reason; because though a man’s life were perfect in every\nvirtue, if it be not devoted to the worship of God, it may indeed be\ncommended by the world, but in heaven it will be only an abomination;\nsince the principal branch of righteousness consists in rendering to God\nthe honour due to him, of which he is impiously defrauded, when it is not\nour end and aim to submit ourselves to his government.\nVIII. It remains for us, in the third place, to explain our position, that\nrepentance consists of two parts—the mortification of the flesh and the\nvivification of the spirit. This is clearly expressed by the prophets,\nalthough in a simple and homely manner, according to the capacity of a\ncarnal people, when they say, “Depart from evil, and do good.”(1629)\nAgain: “Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from\nbefore mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment;\nrelieve the oppressed,” &c.(1630) For when they call men from the paths of\nwickedness, they require the total destruction of the flesh, which is full\nof wickedness and perverseness. It is a thing truly difficult and arduous\nto put off ourselves, and to depart from the native bias of our minds. Nor\nmust the flesh be considered as entirely dead, unless all that we have of\nourselves be destroyed. But since the universal disposition of the flesh\nis settled “enmity against God,”(1631) the first step to an obedience of\nthe law is this renunciation of our own nature. They afterwards designate\nthe renovation by its fruits—righteousness, judgment, and mercy. For a\npunctual performance of these external duties would not be sufficient,\nunless the mind and heart had previously acquired a disposition of\nrighteousness, judgment, and mercy. This takes place when the Spirit of\nGod has tinctured our souls with his holiness, and given them such new\nthoughts and affections, that they may be justly considered as new, [or\naltogether different from what they were before.] And certainly, as we\nhave a natural aversion to God, we shall never aim at that which is right,\nwithout a previous renunciation of ourselves. Therefore we are so\nfrequently commanded to put off the old man, to renounce the world and the\nflesh, to forsake our lusts, and to be renewed in the spirit of our mind.\nBesides, the very word mortification reminds us how difficult it is to\nforget our former nature; for it implies that we cannot be formed to the\nfear of God, and learn the rudiments of piety, without being violently\nslain and annihilated by the sword of the Spirit. As though God had\npronounced that, in order to our being numbered among his children, there\nis a necessity for the destruction of our common nature.\nIX. Both these branches of repentance are effects of our participation of\nChrist. For if we truly partake of his death, our old man is crucified by\nits power, and the body of sin expires, so that the corruption of our\nformer nature loses all its vigour.(1632) If we are partakers of his\nresurrection, we are raised by it to a newness of life, which corresponds\nwith the righteousness of God. In one word I apprehend repentance to be\nregeneration, the end of which is the restoration of the Divine image\nwithin us; which was defaced, and almost obliterated, by the transgression\nof Adam. Thus the apostle teaches us, when he says, “But we all, with open\nface beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the\nsame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”(1633)\nAgain: “Be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put on the new man,\nwhich after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.”(1634)\nAgain, in another place: “And ye have put on the new man, which is renewed\nin knowledge after the image of him that created him.”(1635) Wherefore, in\nthis regeneration, we are restored by the grace of Christ to the\nrighteousness of God, from which we fell in Adam; in which manner the Lord\nis pleased completely to restore all those whom he adopts to the\ninheritance of life. And this restoration is not accomplished in a single\nmoment, or day, or year; but by continual, and sometimes even tardy\nadvances, the Lord destroys the carnal corruptions of his chosen, purifies\nthem from all pollution, and consecrates them as temples to himself;\nrenewing all their senses to real purity, that they may employ their whole\nlife in the exercise of repentance, and know that this warfare will be\nterminated only by death. And so much the greater is the wickedness of\nthat impure and quarrelsome apostate Staphylus, who idly pretends that I\nconfound the state of the present life with the glory of heaven, when I\nexplain the image of God, according to Paul, to be righteousness and true\nholiness. As if, indeed, when any thing is to be defined, we are not to\ninquire after the completeness and perfection of it. It is not denied that\nthere is room for further advances; but I assert, that as far as any man\napproaches to a resemblance of God, so far the image of God is displayed\nin him. That believers may attain to this, God assigns them the race of\nrepentance to run during their whole life.\nX. Thus, therefore, the children of God are liberated by regeneration from\nthe servitude of sin; not that they have already obtained the full\npossession of liberty, and experience no more trouble from the flesh, but\nthere remains in them a perpetual cause of contention to exercise them;\nand not only to exercise them, but also to make them better acquainted\nwith their own infirmity. And on this subject all sound writers are\nagreed—that there still remains in a regenerate man a fountain of evil,\ncontinually producing irregular desires, which allure and stimulate him to\nthe commission of sin. They acknowledge, also, that saints are still so\nafflicted with the disease of concupiscence, that they cannot prevent\ntheir being frequently stimulated and incited either to lust, or to\navarice, or to ambition, or to other vices. There is no need of a\nlaborious investigation, to learn what were the sentiments of the fathers\non this subject: it will be sufficient to consult Augustine alone, who\nwith great diligence and fidelity has collected the opinions of them all.\nFrom him, then, the reader may receive all the certainty he can desire\nconcerning the sense of antiquity. Between him and us, this difference may\nbe discovered—that while he concedes that believers, as long as they\ninhabit a mortal body, are so bound by concupiscence that they cannot but\nfeel irregular desires, yet he ventures not to call this disease by the\nname of _sin_, but, content with designating it by the appellation of\ninfirmity, teaches that it only becomes sin in cases where either action\nor consent is added to the conception or apprehension of the mind, that\nis, where the will yields to the first impulse of appetite. But we, on the\ncontrary, deem it to be sin, whenever a man feels any evil desires\ncontrary to the Divine law; and we also assert the depravity itself to be\nsin, which produces these desires in our minds. We maintain, therefore,\nthat sin always exists in the saints, till they are divested of the mortal\nbody; because their flesh is the residence of that depravity of\nconcupiscence, which is repugnant to all rectitude. Nevertheless, he has\nnot always refrained from using the word sin in this sense; as when he\nsays, “Paul gives the appellation of sin to this, from which all sins\nproceed, that is, to carnal concupiscence. This, as it respects the\nsaints, loses its kingdom on earth, and has no existence in heaven.” In\nthese words he acknowledges that believers are guilty of sin, inasmuch as\nthey are the subjects of carnal concupiscence.\nXI. But when God is said “to cleanse his church”(1636) from all sin, to\npromise the grace of deliverance in baptism, and to fulfil it in his\nelect,—we refer these phrases rather to the guilt of sin, than to the\nexistence of sin. In the regeneration of his children, God does indeed\ndestroy the kingdom of sin in them, (for the Spirit supplies them with\nstrength, which renders them victorious in the conflict;) but though it\nceases to reign, it continues to dwell in them. Wherefore we say, that\n“the old man is crucified,”(1637) that the law of sin is abolished in the\nchildren of God, yet so that some relics remain; not to predominate over\nthem, but to humble them with a consciousness of their infirmity. We\ngrant, indeed, that they are not imputed, any more than if they did not\nexist; but we likewise contend that it is owing to the mercy of God that\nthe saints are delivered from this guilt, who would otherwise be justly\naccounted sinners and guilty before him. Nor will it be difficult for us\nto confirm this opinion, since there are clear testimonies of Scripture to\nsupport it. What can we desire more explicit than the declaration of Paul\nto the Romans?(1638) In the first place, that he there speaks in the\ncharacter of a regenerate man, we have already shown; and Augustine has\nevinced the same by the strongest arguments. I say nothing of his using\nthe words evil and sin. However those who wish to oppose us may cavil at\nthose words, yet who can deny that a resistance to the Divine law is evil?\nwho can deny that an opposition to righteousness is sin? finally, who will\nnot admit that there is guilt wherever there is spiritual misery? But all\nthese things are affirmed by Paul respecting this disease. Besides, we\nhave a certain demonstration from the law, by which this whole question\nmay be briefly decided. For we are commanded to love God with all our\nheart, with all our mind, and with all our strength. Since all the powers\nof our soul ought to be thus occupied by the love of God, it is evident\nthat the precept is not fulfilled by those who receive into their hearts\nthe least desire, or admit into their minds any thought, which may draw\nthem aside from the love of God into vanity. What then? Are not these\nproperties of the soul,—to be affected with sudden emotions, to apprehend\nin the sensory, and to form conceptions in the mind? When these,\ntherefore, open a way for the admission of vain and corrupt thoughts, do\nthey not show that they are so far destitute of the love of God? Whoever,\ntherefore, refuses to acknowledge that all the inordinate desires of the\nflesh are sins, and that that malady of concupiscence, which they call an\nincentive to sin, is the source of sin, must necessarily deny the\ntransgression of the law to be sin.\nXII. If it be thought absurd, that all the natural appetites of man should\nbe thus universally condemned, since they were implanted by God, the\nauthor of nature,—we reply, that we by no means condemn those desires,\nwhich God implanted so deeply in the nature of man at his first creation\nthat they cannot be eradicated from it without destroying humanity itself,\nbut only those insolent and lawless appetites which resist the commands of\nGod. But now, since, through the depravity of nature, all its powers are\nso vitiated and corrupted, that disorder and intemperance are visible in\nall our actions; because the appetites are inseparable from such excesses,\ntherefore we maintain that they are corrupt. Or, if it be wished to have\nthe substance of our opinion in fewer words, we say, that all the desires\nof men are evil; and we consider them to be sinful, not as they are\nnatural, but because they are inordinate; and we affirm they are\ninordinate, because nothing pure or immaculate can proceed from a\ncorrupted and polluted nature. Nor does Augustine deviate from this\ndoctrine so much as he appears to do. When he is too much afraid of the\nodium with which the Pelagians endeavoured to overwhelm him, he sometimes\nrefrains from using the word _sin_: yet when he says, “that the law of sin\nremains in the saints, and that only the guilt is abolished,” he\nsufficiently indicates that he is not averse to our opinion.\nXIII. We will adduce some other passages, from which his sentiments will\nmore fully appear. In his second book against Julian: “This law of sin is\nboth abolished in the spiritual regeneration, and continues in the mortal\nflesh; abolished, since the guilt is removed in the sacrament, by which\nbelievers are regenerated; but continues, because it produces those\ndesires against which also believers contend.” Again: “Therefore the law\nof sin, which was in the members even of so great an apostle, is abolished\nin baptism, but not finally destroyed.” Again: “The law of sin, the\nremaining guilt of which is removed in baptism, Ambrose has called\n_iniquity_; because it is iniquitous for the flesh to lust against the\nspirit.” Again: “Sin is dead in that guilt in which it held us; and,\nalthough dead, it will rebel till it is cured by the perfection of\nburial.” In the fifth book, he is still more explicit: “As blindness of\nheart is both a sin, which consists in a man’s not believing in God; and a\npunishment for sin, by which a proud heart is deservedly punished; and\nalso a cause of sin, when any is committed through the error of a blind\nheart; so the concupiscence of the flesh, against which the good spirit\nlusteth, is both a sin, because it is a disobedience against the\ngovernment of the mind; and a punishment for sin, because it is inflicted\nfor the demerits of the disobedient; and also a cause of sin, consenting\nby defection, or produced from contagion.” Here he styles it _sin_,\nwithout any ambiguity; because, having overthrown error and confirmed the\ntruth, he is not so much afraid of calumnies; as also in the forty‐first\nhomily on John, where he undoubtedly speaks the real sentiments of his\nmind: “If in the flesh you serve the law of sin, do what the apostle\nhimself says—’Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey\nit in the lusts thereof.’(1639) He says not, let it not exist; but, let it\nnot reign. As long as you live, sin must necessarily exist in your\nmembers; let it at least be divested of its kingdom, so that its commands\nmay not be fulfilled.” Those who contend that concupiscence is not sin,\ncommonly object this passage of James—“When lust hath conceived, it\nbringeth forth sin.”(1640) But this objection is easily repelled; for,\nunless we understand him there to speak of evil works exclusively, or of\nactual sins, even an evil volition cannot be accounted sin. But from his\ncalling flagitious and criminal actions the offspring of lust, and\nattributing to them the name of sin, it does not necessarily follow that\nconcupiscence is not an evil thing, and deserving of condemnation in the\nsight of God.\nXIV. Some Anabaptists, in the present age, imagine I know not what frantic\nintemperance, instead of spiritual regeneration—that the children of God,\nbeing restored to a state of innocence, are no longer obliged to be\nsolicitous to restrain the licentiousness of the flesh, but that they\nought to follow the leadings of the Spirit, under whose direction it is\nimpossible ever to err. It would be incredible that the mind of man should\nfall into such madness, did they not publicly and haughtily disseminate\nthis opinion. It is indeed truly prodigious; but it is just and\nreasonable, that those who have persuaded themselves to pervert the truth\nof God into a falsehood, should suffer such punishment for their\nsacrilegious presumption. Must all distinction, then, of honour and\nturpitude, justice and injustice, good and evil, virtue and vice, be\nannihilated? This difference, they say, proceeds from the malediction of\nthe old Adam, from which we are delivered by Christ. Then there will be no\ndifference now between chastity and fornication, sincerity and knavery,\ntruth and falsehood, equity and rapine. Dismiss (they say) all vain fear;\nthe Spirit will command you nothing that is evil, provided you securely\nand intrepidly resign yourself to his direction. Who is not astonished at\nthese monstrous notions? Yet this is a popular philosophy among those,\nwho, blinded by the violence of their appetites, have discarded common\nsense. But what kind of a Christ, and what kind of a Spirit, have they\nfabricated for us? For we acknowledge one Christ and his Spirit alone;\nwhom the prophets have celebrated, whom the gospel proclaims as revealed,\nbut of whom it gives us no such account as this. That Spirit is not the\npatron of murder, fornication, drunkenness, pride, contention, avarice, or\nfraud; but the author of love, chastity, sobriety, modesty, peace,\nmoderation, and truth. He is not a Spirit of fanaticism, rushing\nprecipitately, without any consideration, through right and wrong; but is\nfull of wisdom and understanding, rightly to discern between justice and\ninjustice. He never instigates to dissolute and unrestrained\nlicentiousness; but, discriminating between what is lawful and what is\nunlawful, inculcates temperance and moderation. But why should we spend\nany more labour in refuting this monstrous frenzy? To Christians the\nSpirit of the Lord is not a turbulent phantom, which they have either\nspawned themselves in a dream, or received from the invention of others;\nbut they religiously seek the knowledge of him in the Scriptures, where\nthese two things are delivered concerning him—first, that he is given to\nus in order to our sanctification, to purify us from all our pollutions,\nand lead us to obey the Divine righteousness; which obedience cannot exist\nwithout the subjugation of the appetites, to which these men would allow\nan unlimited license: in the next place, that we are so purified by his\nsanctification, that we are nevertheless still encompassed with numerous\nvices and great infirmity, as long as we are burdened with the body.\nWherefore, being at a great distance from perfection, it behoves us to\nmake continual advances; and being entangled in vices, we have need to\nstrive against them every day. Hence, also, it follows that we ought to\nshake off all slothful security, and exert the most vigilant attention,\nlest, without caution, we should be surprised and overcome by the snares\nof our flesh; unless we are well assured that we have made a greater\nprogress than the apostle; who, nevertheless, was buffeted by the\n“messenger of Satan,”(1641) that his strength might be “made perfect in\nweakness;”(1642) and who faithfully represented the conflict between the\nflesh and the Spirit, which he experienced in his own person.\nXV. When the apostle, in a description of repentance, enumerates seven\nthings, which are either causes producing it, or effects proceeding from\nit, or members and parts of it, he does it for a very good reason. These\nthings are, carefulness, excuse, indignation, fear, vehement desire, zeal,\nrevenge.(1643) Nor ought it to be thought strange that I venture not to\ndetermine whether they should be considered as causes or effects; for\narguments may be adduced in support of both. They may also be styled\naffections connected with repentance; but as we may discover the meaning\nof Paul without discussing these questions, we shall be content with a\nsimple exposition of them. He says, then, that godly sorrow produces\n_solicitude_. For a person who is affected with a serious sense of\ndispleasure because he has sinned against his God, is at the same time\nstimulated to diligence and attention, that he may completely extricate\nhimself from the snares of the devil, and be more cautious of his\ninsidious attacks, that he may not in future disobey the government of the\nSpirit, or be overcome with a careless security. The next thing is _self‐\nexcuse_, which in this place signifies not a defence by which a sinner\ntries to escape the judgment of God, either by denying his transgressions\nor extenuating his guilt, but a kind of excuse, consisting rather in\ndeprecation of punishment than in confidence of his cause. Just as\nchildren, who are not absolutely lost to all sense of duty, while they\nacknowledge and confess their faults, at the same time deprecate\npunishment, and, in order to succeed, testify by every possible method\nthat they have not cast off that reverence which is due to their parents;\nin a word, they excuse themselves in such a manner, not to prove\nthemselves righteous and innocent, but only to obtain pardon. This is\nfollowed by _indignation_, in which the sinner laments within himself,\nexpostulates with himself, and is angry with himself, while he recollects\nhis perverseness and ingratitude to God. The word _fear_ denotes that\ntrepidation with which our minds are penetrated, whenever we reflect upon\nour demerits, and on the terrible severity of the Divine wrath against\nsinners. For we cannot but be agitated with an amazing inquietude, which\nteaches us humility, and renders us more cautious for the future. Now, if\nthe solicitude before mentioned be the offspring of fear, we see the\nconnection and coherence between them. He appears to me to have used the\nword _desire_ to denote diligence in duty and alacrity of obedience, to\nwhich the knowledge of our faults ought to be a most powerful stimulus.\nSimilar to this is the meaning of _zeal_, which he immediately subjoins;\nfor it signifies the ardour with which we are inflamed, when we are roused\nwith such thoughts as these: “What have I done? Whither had I precipitated\nmyself, if I had not been succoured by the mercy of God?” The last thing\nis _revenge_, or punishment; for the greater our severity is towards\nourselves, and the stricter inquisition we make concerning our sins, so\nmuch the stronger hope ought we to entertain that God will be propitious\nand merciful. And, indeed, it is impossible but that a soul, impressed\nwith a dread of the Divine judgment, must inflict some punishment on\nitself. Truly pious persons experience what punishments are contained in\nshame, confusion, lamentation, displeasure with themselves, and the other\naffections which arise from a serious acknowledgment of their\ntransgressions. But let us remember that some limit must be observed, that\nwe may not be overwhelmed in sorrow; for to nothing are terrified\nconsciences more liable than to fall into despair. And with this artifice,\nalso, whomsoever Satan perceives to be dejected by a fear of God, he\nplunges them further and further into the deep gulf of sorrow, that they\nmay never arise again. That fear, indeed, cannot be excessive, which\nterminates in humility, and departs not from the hope of pardon.\nNevertheless, the sinner should always be on his guard, according to the\ndirection of the apostle,(1644)lest while he excites his heart to be\ndispleased with himself, he be _wearied_ with excessive dread, and _faint\nin his mind_; for this would drive us away from God, who calls us to\nhimself by repentance. On this subject, Bernard also gives a very useful\nadmonition: “Sorrow for sin is necessary, if it be not perpetual. I advise\nyou sometimes to quit the anxious and painful recollection of your own\nways, and to arise to an agreeable and serene remembrance of the Divine\nblessings. Let us mingle honey with wormwood, that its salutary bitterness\nmay restore our health, when it shall be drunk tempered with a mixture of\nsweetness; and if you reflect on your own meanness, reflect also on the\ngoodness of the Lord.”\nXVI. Now, it may also be understood what are the fruits of repentance.\nThey are, the duties of piety towards God, and of charity towards men,\nwith sanctity and purity in our whole life. In a word, the more diligently\nany one examines his life by the rule of the Divine law, so much the more\ncertain evidences he discovers of his repentance. The Spirit, therefore,\nin frequently exhorting us to repentance, calls our attention, sometimes\nto all the precepts of the law, sometimes to the duties of the second\ntable; though in other places, after having condemned impurity in the very\nfountain of the heart, he proceeds to those external testimonies which\nevidence a sincere repentance; a view of which I will soon exhibit to the\nreader, in a description of the Christian life. I shall not collect\ntestimonies from the prophets, in which they partly ridicule the follies\nof those who attempt to appease God by ceremonies, and demonstrate them to\nbe mere mockeries; and partly inculcate, that external integrity of life\nis not the principal branch of repentance, because God looks at the heart.\nHe that is but ordinarily acquainted with the Scripture, will discover of\nhimself, without being informed by any one, that in our concerns with God,\nwe advance not a single step unless we begin with the internal affection\nof the heart. And this passage of Joel will afford us no small assistance\nin the interpretation of others: “Rend your heart, and not your\ngarments.”(1645) Both these ideas are briefly expressed in these words of\nJames—“Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double\nminded;”(1646) where there is indeed an addition made to the first clause;\nbut the fountain, or original, is next discovered, showing the necessity\nof cleansing the secret pollution, that an altar may be erected to God\neven in the heart. There are likewise some external exercises which we\nuse, in private, as remedies either to humble ourselves, or to subdue our\ncarnality; and in public, to testify our repentance. They proceed from the\nrevenge mentioned by Paul;(1647) for it is natural to an afflicted mind to\ncontinue in a squalid condition, groaning and weeping, to avoid every kind\nof splendour and pomp, and to forsake all pleasures. He who experiences\nthe great evil of the rebellion of the flesh, seeks every remedy to\nrestrain it. He who properly considers what a grievous thing it is to have\noffended the justice of God, can enjoy no repose till he has glorified God\nby his humility. Such exercises are frequently mentioned by the old\nwriters, when they speak of the fruits of repentance. And though they by\nno means make repentance wholly to consist in them, yet the reader will\npardon me if I deliver my opinion, that they appear to me to insist upon\nthem more than they ought. And I hope every one, on a sober examination,\nwill agree with me, that they have gone beyond all due bounds in two\nrespects. For when they so strongly urged and so extravagantly recommended\nthat corporeal discipline, the consequence was indeed that the common\npeople adopted it with great ardour; but they also obscured that which\nought to be esteemed of infinitely greater importance. Secondly, in the\ninfliction of castigations, they used rather more rigour than was\nconsistent with ecclesiastical gentleness. But we shall have to treat of\nthis in another place.\nXVII. But as some persons, when they find weeping, fasting, and ashes\nmentioned, not only in many other passages of Scripture, but particularly\nin Joel,(1648) consider fasting and weeping as the principal part of\nrepentance, their mistake requires to be rectified. What is there said of\nthe conversion of the whole heart to the Lord, and of rending not the\ngarments, but the heart, properly belongs to repentance; but weeping and\nfasting are not added as perpetual or necessary effects of it, but as\ncircumstances belonging to a particular case. Having prophesied that a\nmost grievous destruction was impending over the Jews, he persuades them\nto prevent the Divine wrath, not only by repentance, but also by\nexhibiting external demonstrations of sorrow. For as it was customary, in\nancient times, for an accused person to present himself in a suppliant\nposture, with a long beard, dishevelled hair, and mourning apparel, in\norder to conciliate the compassion of the judge, so it became those who\nstood as criminals before the tribunal of God, to deprecate his severity\nin a condition calculated to excite commiseration. Though sackcloth and\nashes were perhaps more suitable to those times, yet it is evident that\nthe practice of weeping and fasting would be very seasonable among us,\nwhenever the Lord appears to threaten us with any affliction or calamity.\nFor when he causes danger to appear, he, as it were, denounces that he is\nprepared and armed for the exercise of vengeance. The prophet, therefore,\nwas right in exhorting his countrymen to weeping and fasting; that is, to\nthe sadness of persons under accusation, into whose offences he had just\nbefore said that an examination was instituted. Neither would the pastors\nof the church act improperly in the present age, if, when they perceived\ncalamity impending over the heads of their people, they called them to\nimmediate weeping and fasting; provided they always insisted with the\ngreatest fervour and diligence on the principal point, which is, that they\nmust rend their hearts, and not their garments. It is certain, that\nfasting is not always the concomitant of repentance, but is appointed for\ntimes of peculiar calamity; wherefore Christ connects it with mourning,\nwhen he frees the apostles from any obligation to it, till they should be\naffected with grief at the loss of his presence.(1649) I speak of solemn\nfasting. For the life of the pious ought at all times to be regulated by\nfrugality and sobriety, that through its whole progress it may appear to\nbe a kind of perpetual fast. But as the whole of this subject must be\ndiscussed again, when we come to treat of Ecclesiastical Discipline, I\ntouch the more slightly upon it at present.\nXVIII. I will again remark, however, that when the word _repentance_ is\ntransferred to this external profession, it is improperly changed from the\ngenuine signification which I have stated. For this external profession is\nnot so much a conversion to God, as a confession of sin, with a\ndeprecation of punishment and guilt. Thus to “repent in sackcloth and\nashes,”(1650) is only a declaration of our displeasure against ourselves,\nwhen God is angry with us on account of our grievous offences. And this is\na public species of confession, by which condemning ourselves before\nangels and men, we prevent the judgment of God. For Paul rebukes the\nsluggishness of those who indulge their sins, saying, “If we would judge\nourselves, we should not be judged.”(1651) It is not necessary, in all\ncases, publicly to make men witnesses of our repentance; but a private\nconfession to God is a branch of true penitence which cannot be omitted.\nFor nothing is more unreasonable than that God should pardon sins, in\nwhich we encourage ourselves, and which, lest he should bring them to\nlight, we conceal under the garb of hypocrisy. And it is not only\nnecessary to confess the sins which we commit from day to day; more\ngrievous falls ought to lead us further, and to recall to our remembrance\nthose which appear to have been long buried in oblivion. We learn this\nfrom the example of David;(1652) for, being ashamed of a recent and\nflagitious crime, he examines himself back to the time of his conception,\nand acknowledges that even then he was corrupted and contaminated with\ncarnal impurity; and this not to extenuate his guilt, as many conceal\nthemselves in a multitude, and endeavour to escape with impunity by\nimplicating others with themselves. Very different was the conduct of\nDavid, who ingenuously aggravated his guilt, by confessing that he was\ncorrupted from his earliest infancy, and had never ceased to accumulate\ncrimes upon crimes. In another place, also, he enters on such an\nexamination of his past life, that he implores the Divine mercy to pardon\nthe sins of his youth.(1653) And certainly we shall never give proof that\nwe have shaken off our lethargy, till, groaning under the burden, and\nbewailing our misery, we pray to God for relief. It is further to be\nremarked, that the repentance which we are commanded constantly to\npractise, differs from that which arouses, as it were, from death those\nwho have either fallen into some great enormity, or abandoned themselves\nto a course of sin with unrestrained license, or by any rebellion shaken\noff the Divine yoke. For when the Scripture exhorts to repentance, it\nfrequently signifies a kind of transition and resurrection from death to\nlife; and when it states that the people repented, it means that they\ndeparted from idolatry and other gross enormities; in which sense Paul\ndeclares his grief for sinners, who “have not repented of their\nuncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness.”(1654) This difference\nshould be carefully observed, lest, when we hear that few are called to\nrepentance, we fall into a supine security, as though we had no more to do\nwith the mortification of the flesh, from which the depraved appetites\nthat perpetually disturb us, and the vices that often arise in us, will\nnever permit us to relax. The special repentance, therefore, which is only\nrequired of some whom the devil has seduced from the fear of God, and\nentangled in his fatal snares, supersedes not that ordinary repentance,\nwhich the corruption of nature obliges us to practise during the whole\ncourse of our lives.\nXIX. Now, if it be true, as it certainly is, that the whole substance of\nthe gospel is comprised in these two points, repentance and remission of\nsins,—do not we perceive that the Lord freely justifies his children, that\nhe may also restore them to true righteousness by the sanctification of\nhis Spirit? John, the “messenger sent before the face” of Christ to\n“prepare his way before him,”(1655) preached, “Repent ye, for the kingdom\nof heaven is at hand.”(1656) By calling men to repentance, he taught them\nto acknowledge themselves to be sinners, and every thing belonging to them\nto be condemned before God, that they might earnestly desire and pray for\na mortification of the flesh, and new regeneration in the Spirit. By\nannouncing the kingdom of God, he called them to exercise faith; for by\n“the kingdom of God,” the approach of which he proclaimed, he intended\nremission of sins, salvation, life, and in general all the benefits that\nwe obtain in Christ. Wherefore, in the other evangelists, it is said, that\n“John came, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of\nsins.”(1657) What was intended by this, but that, oppressed and wearied\nwith the burden of sins, men should turn themselves to the Lord, and\nentertain a hope of remission and salvation? Thus, also, Christ commenced\nhis public ministrations. “The kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and\nbelieve the gospel.”(1658) First, he declares that the treasures of mercy\nare opened in himself; then he requires repentance; and lastly, a reliance\non the Divine promises. Therefore, when he would give a brief summary of\nthe whole gospel, he said, that “it behoved him to suffer, and to rise\nfrom the dead; and that repentance and remission of sins should be\npreached in his name.”(1659) The apostles also, after his resurrection,\npreached that he was exalted by God, “to give repentance to Israel and\nremission of sins.”(1660) Repentance is preached in the name of Christ,\nwhen men are informed, by the doctrine of the gospel, that all their\nthoughts, their affections, and their pursuits, are corrupt and vicious;\nand that therefore it is necessary for them to be born again, if they wish\nto enter the kingdom of God. Remission of sins is preached, when men are\ntaught that Christ is made unto them “wisdom, and righteousness, and\nsanctification, and redemption;”(1661) in whose name they are gratuitously\naccounted righteous and innocent in the sight of God. Both these blessings\nof grace, as we have already shown, are apprehended by faith; yet since\nthe goodness of God in the remission of sins is the peculiar object of\nfaith, it was necessary that it should be carefully distinguished from\nrepentance.\nXX. Now, as a hatred of sin, which is the commencement of repentance, is\nour first introduction to the knowledge of Christ, who reveals himself to\nnone but miserable and distressed sinners, who mourn, and labour, and are\nheavy laden; who hunger and thirst, and are pining away with grief and\nmisery;(1662) so it is necessary for us, if we desire to abide in Christ,\nto strive for this repentance, to devote our whole lives to it, and to\npursue it to the last. For he “came to call sinners,” but it was to call\nthem “to repentance.”(1663) He was “sent to bless” the unworthy; but it\nwas “in turning away every one from his iniquities.”(1664) The Scripture\nis full of such expressions. Wherefore, when God offers remission of sins,\nhe generally requires repentance on the part of the sinner; implying that\nhis mercy ought to furnish a motive to excite us to repentance. “Keep ye\njudgment, and do justice; for my salvation is near.”(1665) Again: “The\nRedeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in\nJacob.”(1666) Again: “Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon\nhim while he is near: let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous\nman his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy\nupon him.”(1667) Again: “Repent, and be converted, that your sins may be\nblotted out.”(1668) Here it must be remarked, however, that this condition\nis not annexed in such a manner, as though our repentance were the\nfundamental and meritorious cause of pardon; but rather, because the Lord\nhas determined to have mercy upon men, in order that they may repent, he\ninforms them what course they must take if they wish to obtain his favour.\nTherefore, as long as we inhabit the prison of our body, we shall have to\nmaintain an incessant conflict with the vices of our corrupt nature, and\neven with our natural soul. Plato sometimes says, that the life of a\nphilosopher is a meditation of death. We may assert with more truth, that\nthe life of a Christian is perpetually employed in the mortification of\nthe flesh, till it is utterly destroyed, and the Spirit of God obtains the\nsole empire within us. Wherefore I think that he has made a very\nconsiderable proficiency, who has learned to be exceedingly displeased\nwith himself: not that he should remain in this distress, and advance no\nfurther, but rather hasten and aspire towards God; that being ingrafted\ninto the death and life of Christ, he may make repentance the object of\nhis constant meditation and pursuit. And this cannot but be the conduct of\nthose who feel a genuine hatred of sin; for no man ever hated sin, without\nhaving been previously captivated with the love of righteousness. This\ndoctrine, as it is the most simple of all, so also it appears to me to be\nmost consistent with the truth of the Scripture.\nXXI. That repentance is a peculiar gift of God, must, I think, be so\nevident from the doctrine just stated, as to preclude the necessity of a\nlong discourse to prove it. Therefore the Church praises and admires the\ngoodness of God, that he “hath granted to the Gentiles repentance unto\nlife;”(1669) and Paul, when he enjoins Timothy to be patient and gentle\ntowards unbelievers, says, “If God, peradventure, will give them\nrepentance, that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the\ndevil.”(1670) God affirms, indeed, that he wills the conversion of all\nmen, and directs his exhortations promiscuously to all; but the efficacy\nof these exhortations depends on the Spirit of regeneration. For it were\nmore easy to make ourselves men, than by our own power to endue ourselves\nwith a more excellent nature. Therefore, in the whole course of\nregeneration, we are justly styled God’s “workmanship, created unto good\nworks, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.”(1671)\nWhomsoever God chooses to rescue from destruction, them he vivifies by the\nSpirit of regeneration: not that repentance is properly the cause of\nsalvation, but because, as we have already seen, it is inseparable from\nfaith and the mercy of God; since, according to the testimony of Isaiah,\n“the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from\ntransgression in Jacob.”(1672) It remains an unshaken truth, that wherever\nthe fear of God prevails in the heart, the Spirit has operated to the\nsalvation of that individual. Therefore, in Isaiah, where believers are\nbewailing and deploring their being deserted by God, they mention this as\na sign of reprobation, that their hearts are hardened by him.(1673) The\napostle also, intending to exclude apostates from all hope of salvation,\nasserts, as a reason, that “it is impossible to renew them again unto\nrepentance;”(1674) because God, in the renewal of those whom he will not\nsuffer to perish, discovers an evidence of his paternal favour, and\nattracts them to himself with the radiance of his serene and joyful\ncountenance; whilst, on the contrary, he displays his wrath in hardening\nthe reprobate, whose impiety is never to be forgiven.(1675) This kind of\nvengeance the apostle denounces against wilful apostates, who, when they\ndepart from the faith of the gospel, deride God, contumeliously reject his\ngrace, profane and trample on the blood of Christ, and do all in their\npower to crucify him again. For he does not, as is pretended by some\npreposterously severe persons, preclude all voluntary sinners from a hope\nof pardon. His design is to show that apostasy is unworthy of every\nexcuse, and therefore it is not strange that God punishes such a\nsacrilegious contempt of himself with inexorable rigour. “For it is\nimpossible (he tells us) for those who were once enlightened, and have\ntasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,\nand have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,\nif they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they\ncrucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open\nshame.”(1676) Again: “If we sin wilfully after that we have received the\nknowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a\ncertain fearful looking‐for of judgment.”(1677) These are the passages,\nfrom a misinterpretation of which the Novatians formerly derived a\npretence for their extravagant opinions; and the apparent harshness of\nwhich has offended some good men, and induced them to believe that this\nEpistle is supposititious, though every part of it contains unequivocal\nevidences of the apostolic spirit. But as we are contending only with\nthose who receive it, it is easy to show that these passages afford not\nthe least countenance to their error. In the first place, the apostle must\nnecessarily be in unison with his Master, who affirms that “all sin and\nblasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Holy\nGhost, which shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the\nworld to come.”(1678) The apostle, I say, must certainly have been content\nwith this exception, unless we wish to make him an enemy to the grace of\nChrist. Whence it follows, that pardon is denied to no particular sins,\nexcept one, which proceeds from desperate fury, and cannot be attributed\nto infirmity, but clearly proves a man to be possessed by the devil.\nXXII. But, for the further elucidation of this subject, it is necessary to\ninquire into the nature of that dreadful crime which will obtain no\nforgiveness. Augustine somewhere defines it to be an obstinate\nperverseness, attended with a despair of pardon, and continued till death;\nbut this is not consistent with the language of Christ, that “it shall not\nbe forgiven in this world.” For either this is a vain assertion, or the\nsin may be committed in this life. But if the definition of Augustine be\nright, it is never committed unless it continue till death. Others say,\nthat a man sins against the Holy Ghost, who envies the grace bestowed on\nhis brother. I know no foundation for this notion. But we will adduce the\ntrue definition; which when it shall have been proved by strong\ntestimonies, will of itself easily overturn all others. I say, then, that\nthe sin against the Holy Ghost is committed by those who, though they are\nso overpowered with the splendour of Divine truth that they cannot pretend\nignorance, nevertheless resist it with determined malice, merely for the\nsake of resisting it. For Christ, in explanation of what he had asserted,\nimmediately subjoins, “Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man,\nit shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost,\nit shall not be forgiven him.”(1679) And Matthew, instead of “blasphemy\nagainst the Spirit,” says, “blasphemy of the Spirit.”(1680) How can any\none cast a reproach on the Son, that is not also directed against the\nSpirit? Those who unadvisedly offend against the truth of God, which they\nknow not, and who ignorantly revile Christ, but at the same time have such\na disposition that they would not extinguish the Divine truth if revealed\nto them, or utter one injurious word against him whom they knew to be the\nLord’s Christ,—they sin against the Father and the Son. Thus there are\nmany, in the present day, who most inveterately execrate the doctrines of\nthe gospel, which if they knew to be the evangelical doctrine, they would\nbe ready to venerate with their whole heart. But those who are convinced\nin their conscience, that it is the word of God which they reject and\noppose, and yet continue their opposition,—they are said to blaspheme\nagainst the Spirit, because they strive against the illumination which is\nthe work of the Holy Spirit. Such were some among the Jews, who, when they\nwere not able to resist the Spirit(1681) that spake by Stephen, yet\nobstinately strove to resist. Many of them were undoubtedly urged to this\nconduct by a zeal for the law; but it appears that there were others, who\nwere infuriated by a malignant impiety against God himself, that is,\nagainst the doctrine which they knew to be from God. Such also were the\nPharisees, whom the Lord rebuked; who, in order to counteract the\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit, slanderously ascribed it to the power of\nBeelzebub.(1682) This, then, is “blasphemy of the Spirit,” where the\npresumption of man deliberately strives to annihilate the glory of God.\nThis is implied in the observation of Paul, that he “obtained mercy,\nbecause” he had “ignorantly in unbelief” committed those crimes, the\ndemerits of which would otherwise have excluded him from the grace of the\nLord.(1683) If the union of ignorance and unbelief was the reason of his\nobtaining pardon, it follows that there is no room for pardon where\nunbelief has been attended with knowledge.\nXXIII. But, on a careful observation, you will perceive that the apostle\nspeaks not of one or more particular falls, but of the universal\ndefection, by which the reprobate exclude themselves from salvation. We\nneed not wonder that those whom John, in his canonical Epistle, affirms\nnot to have been of the number of the elect from whom they departed,\nexperience God to be implacable towards them.(1684) For he directs his\ndiscourse against those who imagined that they might return to the\nChristian religion, although they had once apostatized from it; to whom he\ncontradicts this false and pernicious notion, declaring, what is\nabsolutely true, that it is impossible for persons to return to the\ncommunion of Christ, who have knowingly and wilfully rejected it. And it\nis rejected, not by those who simply transgress the word of the Lord by a\ndissolute and licentious life, but by those who professedly renounce all\nhis doctrines. Therefore the fallacy lies in the terms _falling away_ and\n_sinning_; for the Novatians explain _falling away_ to take place, when\nany one, after having been instructed by the law of the Lord that theft\nand fornication ought not to be committed, yet abstains not from either of\nthese sins. But, on the contrary, I affirm that there is a tacit\nantithesis understood, which ought to contain a repetition of all the\nopposites of the things which had been previously mentioned; so that this\npassage expresses not any particular vice, but a universal defection from\nGod, and if I may use the expression, an apostasy of the whole man. When\nhe speaks, therefore, of some who fell away, “after they were once\nenlightened, and had tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers\nof the Holy Ghost, and the powers of the world to come,”(1685) it must be\nunderstood of persons who, with deliberate impiety, have smothered the\nlight of the Spirit, rejected the taste of the heavenly gift, alienated\nthemselves from the sanctification of the Spirit, and trampled on the word\nof God and the powers of the world to come. And the more fully to express\nthat decided determination of impiety, he afterwards, in another place,\nadds the word _wilfully_. For when he says, that “if we sin wilfully after\nthat we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more\nsacrifice,”(1686) he denies not that Christ is a perpetual sacrifice to\nexpiate the iniquities of the saints, which almost the whole Epistle\nexpressly proclaims in describing the priesthood of Christ, but intends\nthat there remains no other where that is rejected. But it is rejected,\nwhen the truth of the gospel is avowedly renounced.\nXXIV. The objection of some, who conceive it to be severe and inconsistent\nwith the Divine clemency, that pardon should be refused to any who flee to\nthe Lord imploring his mercy, is easily answered. For he affirms not that\npardon is denied to them if they turn themselves to the Lord; but he\nabsolutely denies the possibility of their attaining to repentance,\nbecause they are stricken with eternal blindness by the righteous judgment\nof God, on account of their ingratitude. Nor is it any objection that the\nsame apostle afterwards accommodates to this subject the example of Esau,\nwho vainly endeavoured with weeping and lamentation to recover his lost\nrights of primogeniture. Nor that the prophet utters this denunciation:\n“though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.”(1687) For\nsuch forms of expression signify neither true conversion nor invocation of\nGod, but the anxiety felt by the impious in extreme calamity, which\nconstrains them to consider, what before they carelessly disregarded, that\nnothing can do them any good but the assistance of the Lord. And this they\ndo not so much implore, as bewail its being withheld from them. Therefore\nthe prophet intends by _crying_, and the apostle by _weeping_, only that\ndreadful torment which excruciates the impious with the agonies of\ndespair. This requires to be carefully observed, because otherwise this\nprocedure of God would contradict his proclamation by the mouth of the\nprophet, that as soon as the sinner shall have turned, he will be\npropitious to him.(1688) And, as I have already remarked, it is certain\nthat the human mind is not changed for the better, except by the previous\ninfluence of his grace. Nor will his promise respecting those who call\nupon him, ever deceive; but it is improper to apply the terms _conversion_\nand _prayer_ to that blind torment by which the reprobate are distracted,\nwhen they see that it is necessary for them to seek God in order to find a\nremedy for their miseries, while at the same time they continue to flee\nfrom his approach.\nXXV. But it is inquired, since the apostle denies that God is appeased by\na hypocritical repentance, how Ahab obtained pardon, and averted the\npunishment with which he had been threatened, though he appears, from the\nsubsequent tenor of his life, to have been only terrified by a sudden\nconsternation. He clothed himself with sackcloth, sprinkled ashes upon his\nhead, lay on the ground, and, as it is declared concerning him, “humbled\nhimself before God;”(1689) but it was nothing to rend his garments, while\nhis heart remained perverse and inflated with wickedness. Yet we see how\nGod is inclined to clemency. I reply, that sometimes hypocrites are thus\nspared for a season, yet that the wrath of God always abides upon them,\nand that this is done not so much for their sakes, as for a public\nexample. For what benefit did Ahab receive from the mitigation of the\nthreatened punishment, but a respite from it during his continuance in\nthis world? The malediction of God, therefore, although concealed, fixed\nitself in his family, and he himself went forward to eternal perdition.\nThe same may be observed in the case of Esau; for though he suffered a\nrepulse, yet a temporal benediction was granted to his tears.(1690) But\nsince the spiritual inheritance, according to the oracle of God, could\nremain only with one of the brothers, when Jacob was chosen and Esau\nrejected, that preterition shut out the Divine mercy; yet this consolation\nwas left to him as to a man on a level with the brutes, that he should be\nenriched with “the fatness of the earth and the dew of heaven.” This is\nwhat I have just observed ought to be considered as an example to others,\nthat we may learn to devote our minds and our exertions with more alacrity\nto sincere repentance; because it is not to be doubted that those who are\ntruly and cordially converted will find God readily disposed to\nforgiveness, whose clemency extends itself even to the unworthy, as long\nas they manifest any appearance of contrition. At the same time, also, we\nare taught what dreadful vengeance awaits all the obstinate, who, with\nimpudent countenances and hardened hearts, despise, disregard, and\nridicule the Divine threatenings. Thus he frequently extended his hand to\nthe children of Israel, to alleviate their distresses, notwithstanding\ntheir supplications were hypocritical, and their hearts full of duplicity\nand perfidy; as he complains in one of the Psalms,(1691) that they\nimmediately after returned to their former courses. He designed by his\nmerciful kindness, either to bring them to a serious conversion, or to\nrender them inexcusable. Yet, by the temporary remission of punishments,\nhe imposes on himself no perpetual law, but sometimes arises against\nhypocrites with the greater severity, and enhances their punishments, to\nmanifest his extreme displeasure against hypocrisy. But he exhibits, as I\nhave observed, some examples of his readiness to pardon, in order to\nanimate the pious to a correction of their lives, and the more severely to\ncondemn the pride of those who obstinately kick against the goads."

          "title": "Chapter IV. The Sophistry And Jargon Of The Schools Concerning Repentance,",
          "content": "Very Remote From The Purity Of The Gospel. On Confession And Satisfaction.\nI come now to the discussion of those things which have been advanced by\nthe sophists of the schools concerning Repentance, which I shall run over\nas briefly as possible; for it is not my design to pursue the subject at\nlarge, lest this book, which I am endeavouring to make a compendium of\ndoctrine, should be drawn out to an immoderate extent. They have involved\na subject, otherwise not very intricate, in so many perplexities, that\nthose who have entered but a little way into their labyrinths will not\nfind it easy to extricate themselves. In the first place, the definition\nthey have given of repentance, clearly shows that they never understood\nwhat it was; for they catch at some passages in the writings of the\nfathers, which by no means express the nature of repentance; as, “that to\nrepent is to weep for sins previously committed, and not to commit sins to\nbe wept for.” Again: “that it is to lament evils that are past, and not to\ncommit new ones to be lamented.” Again: “that it is a kind of mournful\nvengeance, punishing in ourselves what we bewail having committed.” Again:\n“that it is a sorrow of heart and bitterness of soul on account of the\nevils which a man has committed, or to which he has consented.” But though\nwe concede that these expressions were properly used by the fathers,\nwhich, however, a contentious man would find no difficulty in denying, yet\nthey were used not with a view to describe repentance, but only to exhort\ntheir readers to avoid relapsing into those crimes from which they had\nbeen delivered. But if we are disposed to convert all observations of this\nkind into definitions, others may be added with equal propriety. As this\nof Chrysostom, “Repentance is a medicine which destroys sin, a gift\nbestowed from heaven, an admirable virtue, a grace exceeding the power of\nlaws.” Moreover, the doctrine which they afterwards advance is still worse\nthan these definitions; for they are so obstinately riveted to external\nexercises, that one can collect nothing else from immense volumes, but\nthat repentance is an austere discipline, which serves partly to subdue\nthe flesh, partly to chastise and punish vices; but concerning the\ninternal renovation of the mind, which is attended with a real reformation\nof the life, they observe a wonderful silence. Of _contrition_ and\n_attrition_, indeed, they treat largely; they torment souls with a\nmultitude of scruples, and drive them to extreme trouble and anxiety; but\nwhen they appear to have thoroughly wounded the heart, they heal all the\nbitterness by a slight sprinkling of ceremonies. Having thus quaintly\ndefined repentance, they divide it into contrition of heart, confession of\nmouth, and satisfaction of work—a division which is no more agreeable to\nthe rules of logic than their definition, though they would be thought to\nhave spent their whole lives in composing syllogisms. But should any one\nreason from the definition, (which is a kind of argumentation common among\nlogicians,) that a man may weep for sins previously committed, and commit\nno more to be wept for; may lament evils that are past, and commit no more\nto be lamented; may punish what he mourns that he has committed, &c.,\nalthough he makes no confession with his mouth; how will they defend their\ndivision? For if he who confesses not, be nevertheless truly penitent,\nrepentance may exist where there is no confession. But if they reply that\nthis division refers to repentance as a sacrament, or is to be understood\nof the complete perfection of repentance, which they comprehend not in\ntheir definition, they have no reason to accuse me; let them impute the\nblame to themselves, for not giving definitions with more correctness and\nperspicuity. For myself, indeed, according to my dull capacity, in all\ncontroversies I refer every thing to the definition, which is the hinge\nand foundation of the whole argument. But, admitting this to be their\nmagisterial license, we proceed to an attentive examination of the parts\nthemselves in order. When I neglect, and pass over as frivolous, things\nwhich, with supercilious gravity, they represent as mysteries, I never do\nit without design; not that I should find it very laborious to canvass the\narguments in which they conceive themselves to have discovered most\nshrewdness and subtilty; but I could not conscientiously fatigue my\nreaders with such impertinences to no good purpose. From the questions\nwhich they raise and agitate, and with which they miserably embarrass\nthemselves, it is easy to see, that they talk of subjects of which they\nare utterly ignorant; such as this: Whether repentance for one sin be\npleasing to God during an obstinate continuance in others. Again: Whether\npunishments inflicted by God be available for satisfaction. Again: Whether\nrepentance may be frequently repeated for mortal sins. On this point they\nshamefully and impiously determine, that repentance is daily practised\nonly for venial sins. They also torment themselves much with a gross\nerror, in an expression of Jerome, “That repentance is a second plank\nafter a shipwreck;” thus giving proof, that they have never been awakened\nfrom their brutish stupidity, so as to have even the most distant view of\nthe thousandth part of their sins.\nII. I wish the reader to consider, that this is not a contention about an\ninsignificant trifle, but a question respecting the most serious of all\nsubjects—remission of sins. For by requiring, in repentance, compunction\nof heart, confession of mouth, and satisfaction of work, they maintain,\nthat these three things are necessary to procure the remission of sins.\nBut if it be important for us to know any thing in the whole science of\nreligion, it is certainly of the greatest importance to apprehend, and\nfully to understand, by what means, by what law, on what condition, and\nwith what facility or difficulty, remission of sins may be obtained.\nUnless this knowledge be clear and certain, the conscience can have no\nrest, no peace with God, no confidence or security; but is the subject of\nperpetual trepidations and fluctuations, is disturbed, tormented, and\nharassed, and dreads, hates, and avoids the presence of God. But if\nremission of sins depend on those conditions to which they confine it, we\nare in a most miserable and deplorable situation. They make contrition the\nfirst step towards obtaining pardon, and require such as is due from us,\nthat is, such as is just and perfect; but they have not determined, when a\nman may be assured that he has arrived at this degree of perfect\ncontrition. I grant, indeed, that every man ought to be sedulously and\nearnestly urged, that by bitterly mourning for his sins, he may\ncontinually augment his displeasure and hatred against them. For this\n“sorrow worketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of.”(1692) But\nwhen such an anguish of sorrow is required as may correspond to the\nmagnitude of the guilt, and may be weighed in the balance with confidence\nof pardon, then the wretched conscience is wonderfully tormented and\nagitated, when it sees a due contrition for sins imposed on it, and\nunderstands not the extent of the debt so as to be able to decide with\nitself that it has discharged what was due from it. If they say that we\nmust do what we can, we still return to the same point; for when will any\nman presume to flatter himself that he has exerted all his power in\nbewailing his sins? Consciences, therefore, that have been long striving\nwith themselves, and exercised in tedious conflicts, but without finding\nat length any place of rest, endeavour to procure some small alleviation,\nextorting from themselves some sorrow, and forcing out some tears to\ncomplete their contrition.\nIII. If they charge me with calumny, let them come forth and produce a\nsingle individual, who has not, by this doctrine of contrition, either\nbeen driven into despair, or endeavoured to avert the Divine judgment by a\npretended sorrow instead of real compunction. We have said ourselves, that\nforgiveness of sins is never enjoyed without repentance, because none but\nthose who are afflicted and wounded with a consciousness of sins, can\nsincerely implore the mercy of God; but we have likewise added, that\nrepentance is not the cause of remission of sins. But those torments of\nsoul, which they say are duties to be performed, we have put aside. We\nhave taught the sinner not to look on his compunction or on his tears, but\nto fix both his eyes solely on the mercy of God. We have only declared,\nthat Christ called the labouring and heavy‐laden, when he was sent “to\npreach the gospel to the poor, to heal the broken‐hearted, to preach\ndeliverance to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that\nare bound, and to comfort all that mourn.”(1693) This would exclude the\nPharisees, who, satisfied with their own righteousness, acknowledge not\ntheir poverty; and despisers, who, careless of the wrath of God, seek no\nremedy for their disease; for such neither labour, nor are heavy‐laden;\nthey are not broken‐hearted, or in bondage, or in captivity. But there is\na considerable difference, whether a man be taught to merit remission of\nsins by a true and perfect contrition, (which no sinner can ever perform,)\nor be instructed to hunger and thirst for the Divine mercy, that by the\nknowledge of his misery, by his disquietude, fatigue, and captivity, he\nmay be shown where he ought to seek for consolation, rest, and liberty,\nand may learn to glorify God by his humility.\nIV. Concerning confession, there has always been a great controversy\nbetween the canonists and the scholastic divines; the latter contending,\nthat confession is commanded by the word of God; the other, on the\ncontrary, maintaining that it is enjoined only by the ecclesiastical\nconstitutions. But this controversy has discovered the singular impudence\nof the theologians, who have corrupted and violently distorted all the\npassages of Scripture which they have cited in favour of their argument.\nAnd when they perceived that they could not even thus obtain what they\ndesired, those who would appear more shrewd than others, resorted to this\nsubterfuge, that confession, as to the substance of it, came from the\nDivine law, but afterwards derived its form from a positive law. In a\nsimilar manner the most foolish lawyers pretend, that citations originated\nfrom the Divine law, because it is said, “Adam, where art thou?”(1694) and\nexceptions also, because Adam answered, as if by way of exception, “The\nwoman whom thou gavest to be with me,” &c.; but that both received their\nform from the civil code. But let us examine by what arguments they prove\nthis confession, either formal or informal, to have been commanded by God.\nThe Lord, say they, sent leprous persons to the priests. What then? Did he\nsend them to confession? Who ever heard that the Levitical priests were\nappointed to hear confessions? Therefore they resort to allegories: it was\nenacted by the Mosaic law, that the priests should distinguish between\nleprosy and leprosy; sin is a spiritual leprosy, concerning which it is\nthe office of the priests to decide. Before I reply to this, I would\ninquire, by the way, if this passage constitutes them judges of the\nspiritual leprosy, why do they arrogate to themselves the cognizance of\nthe natural and corporeal leprosy? Is not this trifling with the\nScriptures? The law commits to the Levitical priests the cognizance of the\nleprosy; let us usurp this to ourselves. Sin is a spiritual leprosy; let\nus also take cognizance of sin. Now, I reply, “The priesthood being\nchanged, there is made, of necessity, a change also of the law.”(1695) All\nthe priestly functions have been transferred to Christ; in him they are\nfulfilled and finished; therefore every privilege and honour of the\nsacerdotal office has been transferred to him alone. If they are so\nextremely fond of pursuing allegories, let them propose Christ to\nthemselves as the only priest, and accumulate on his tribunal the\nunlimited jurisdiction over all things; this we shall easily admit.\nBesides, this allegory of theirs is very absurd, since it places among the\nceremonies a law that was merely political. Why, then, does Christ send\nleprous persons to the priests? To preclude the priests from calumniating\nhim with a violation of the law, which commanded him that was cured of the\nleprosy to show himself to the priest, and to be purged by the oblation of\na sacrifice. “Go (said he) show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift\nthat Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.”(1696) And truly this\nmiracle was to be a testimony to them; for they had pronounced him\nleprous, now they pronounce him healed. Are they not, whether willingly or\nreluctantly, constrained to become witnesses of the miracles of Christ?\nChrist gives them his miracle for their examination; they cannot deny it;\nbut because they still cavil, this work is a testimony to them. Thus it is\nsaid, “This gospel shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto\nall nations.”(1697) Again: “Ye shall be brought before governors and\nkings, for a testimony against them.”(1698) That is, that they may be more\npowerfully convicted at the judgment of God. But if they would rather\ncoincide with Chrysostom, he also teaches, that Christ did this on account\nof the Jews, that he might not be deemed a transgressor of the law. Though\non a point so clear I am ashamed to adduce the suffrage of any man; when\nChrist declares that he leaves the legal rights entirely to the priests,\nas the professed enemies of the gospel, who were always ready to cavil, if\ntheir mouths were not stopped. Wherefore the Popish priests, in order to\nretain this possession, should publicly espouse the party of those whom it\nis necessary to restrain by force from uttering their curses against\nChrist. For with this his true ministers have no concern.\nV. Their second argument they derive from the same source, that is, from\nallegory; as though allegories were sufficient for the confirmation of any\ndogma. Let them be admitted as sufficient, if I do not prove that those\nvery allegories may be urged by me with more plausibility than they\npossibly can by them. They plead, therefore, that the Lord commanded his\ndisciples to loose Lazarus from his bandages, when he was raised from the\ngrave.(1699) Here, in the first place, they are guilty of falsehood; for\nit is nowhere recorded, that the Lord said this to his disciples; and it\nis much more probable that he said it to the Jews who were standing near\nhim, that the miracle might be rendered more evident, beyond all suspicion\nof fraud, and that his power might appear the greater, from his raising\nthe dead to life without the least touch, solely by the call of his voice.\nFor I apprehend, that the Lord, in order to remove from the minds of the\nJews every unfavourable suspicion, chose that they should roll back the\nstone, should perceive the fetid odour, should see the certain tokens of\ndeath, should behold him rising by the sole energy of a word, and be the\nfirst to touch him on his restoration to life. And this is the opinion of\nChrysostom. But admitting this to have been addressed to the disciples,\nwhat will they gain by it? That the Lord gave his apostles the power of\nloosing; but with how much more aptitude and skill might these words be\nhandled in an allegorical sense, if we should say, that God intended by\nthis emblem to instruct believers, that they ought to loose those whom he\nhas raised to life; that is, that they should not recall to remembrance\nthe sins which he had forgotten; that they should not condemn as sinners\nthose whom he had absolved; that they should not continue to upbraid with\noffences which he had forgiven; that where he is merciful and ready to\nspare, they should not be severe and rigorous to punish! Nothing, surely,\nought to be a stronger motive to the exercise of forgiveness by us, than\nthe example of that judge, who threatens to be implacable towards them who\nare too rigorous and cruel. Let them go now and boast of their allegories.\nVI. They come to a closer contest, when they oppose us with what they\napprehend to be plain passages. Those who came to the baptism of John\nconfessed their sins;(1700) and James directs us to confess our sins one\nto another.(1701) It is no wonder, if those who desired to be baptized\nconfessed their sins, for it is said, that John “preached the baptism of\nrepentance,” and “baptized with water unto repentance.” Whom, then, should\nhe baptize, but such as confessed themselves sinners? Baptism is an emblem\nof remission of sins; and who should be admitted to this emblem but\nsinners, and those who acknowledged themselves to be such? They confessed\ntheir sins, therefore, in order to be baptized. Nor is it without reason\nthat James directs us to confess one to another. But if they would observe\nwhat immediately follows, they would perceive, that this also affords them\nvery little support. “Confess (says he) your faults one to another, and\npray for one another.” He connects mutual confession and mutual prayer. If\nour confessions must be made only to priests, then our prayers ought to be\noffered up for them alone. But would it not follow from the language of\nJames, that priests alone might make confessions? For when he enjoins\nmutual confession, he addresses such only as have a right to hear the\nconfessions of others. Αλληλοι implies mutually, by turns, successively,\nor reciprocally. But none can reciprocally confess, but those who are\nqualified to hear confessions. And since they dignify the priests\nexclusively with this prerogative, we also relinquish to them alone the\ntask of making confession. Then let us dismiss such impertinences, and\nattend to the real meaning of the apostle, which is simple and clear; it\nis, that we should reciprocally communicate our infirmities to each other,\nto receive from one another mutual advice, mutual compassion, and mutual\nconsolation; and, also, that being mutually conscious of the infirmities\nof our brethren, we should pray to the Lord on their behalf. Why, then, do\nthey quote James in opposition to us, when we so strongly urge a\nconfession of the Divine mercy? But no man can confess the mercy of God,\nif he has not previously confessed his own misery. Indeed, we rather\npronounce an anathema against him who has not confessed himself a sinner\nbefore God, before his angels, before the Church, and, in a word, before\nall mankind. “For the Scripture hath concluded all under sin—that every\nmouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before\nGod;”(1702) and that he alone may be justified and exalted.\nVII. But I wonder with what face they can presume to contend, that the\nconfession of which they speak is of Divine appointment. The practice we\nadmit to be very ancient, but we can easily prove, that Christians were\nformerly quite at liberty as to the use of it. That there was no fixed law\nor constitution respecting it till the time of Innocent III., is certain\nfrom the testimony of their own histories. Surely, if there had been a\nmore ancient law, they would rather have cited it, than, by being content\nwith a decree of the Council of Lateran, have rendered themselves\nridiculous even in the eyes of children. They hesitate not in other cases\nto fabricate fictitious decrees, which they ascribe to the most ancient\ncouncils, that they may dazzle the eyes of the simple by a veneration for\nantiquity. In this instance they never thought of obtruding such a\nforgery. Therefore, according to their own testimony, three hundred years\nhave not yet elapsed, since Innocent III. introduced the snare, and\nimposed the necessity of confession. But, to say nothing respecting the\ntime, the barbarism of the diction is, of itself, sufficient to deprive\nthat law of all credit. For the good fathers enjoin, that every person, of\nboth sexes, shall, once in every year, make a particular confession of all\nsins to the proper priest; but some wits facetiously object, that this\nprecept binds none but hermaphrodites, and relates to no one who is either\na male or a female. Moreover, their disciples have betrayed still greater\nfolly, in their inability to explain what is meant by the proper priest.\nWhatever may be clamorously pretended by all the Pope’s mercenary\ndisputants, we are certain, that Christ was not the author of this law,\nwhich compels men to enumerate their sins, and that twelve centuries\npassed away after the resurrection of Christ, before any such law was\npromulgated; so that this tyranny was not introduced till after the\nextinction of piety and learning, when masques, occupying the place of\npastors, had assumed an unlimited license of doing whatever they pleased.\nThere are also plain testimonies, in histories and other ancient writings,\nwhich inform us, that this was a political discipline instituted by\nbishops, not a law given by Christ or his apostles. Of a great number, I\nshall produce only one, which will be a clear proof of this assertion.\nSozomen, in his Ecclesiastical History, relates, that this ordinance of\nthe bishops was diligently observed in all the Western Churches, and\nespecially at Rome. He fully implies that it was not the universal custom\nof all the churches, and says, that one of the Presbyters was peculiarly\nappointed to this office. In this, he abundantly confutes the false\npretensions of these men, that the keys were given promiscuously, for this\nuse, to the whole sacerdotal order, since it was not the common function\nof all priests, but the peculiar department of one who was chosen to it by\nthe bishop. This is the same, who, in the present day, in every cathedral\nchurch is called the Penitentiary, who takes cognizance of crimes of\npeculiar enormity, and such as are censured for the sake of example. The\nhistorian immediately adds, that this was the custom also at\nConstantinople, till a certain matron, pretending to go to confession, was\ndiscovered to have concealed, under this specious pretext, a criminal\nconnection with the deacon of that church. On account of this crime,\nNectarius, the bishop of the church, (a man eminent for sanctity and\nerudition,) abolished the ceremony of confession. Here let them erect\ntheir asinine ears. If auricular confession had been a law of God, how\ncould Nectarius have presumed to reverse and disannul it? Will they accuse\nNectarius of heresy and schism, who is acknowledged by all the fathers to\nhave been a holy man of God? But the same sentence would condemn the\nConstantinopolitan church, in which Sozomen affirms the custom of\nconfession not only to have been discontinued for a season, but to have\nbeen altogether disused down to his time. And they would accuse of\napostasy, not only the church of Constantinople, but all the Oriental\nchurches, who neglected a law which they maintain to be inviolable and\nobligatory on all Christians.\nVIII. But this abrogation is plainly attested by Chrysostom, who was\nhimself also a bishop of the church of Constantinople, in so many places,\nthat it is surprising how they dare to open their mouths in contradiction\nof it. “Confess your sins, (says he,) that you may obliterate them. If you\nare ashamed to tell any one what sins you have committed, confess them\ndaily in your soul. I say not, that you should confess them to your\nfellow‐servant, who may reproach you; confess them to God, who cures them.\nConfess your sins on your bed, that there your conscience may daily\nrecognize its crimes.” Again: “But, now, it is not necessary to confess in\nthe presence of witnesses; let an inquisition into your transgressions be\nthe work of your own thoughts; let there be no witness of this judgment;\nlet God alone see you confessing.” Again: “I conduct you not into the\npublic view of your fellow‐servants; I do not oblige you to reveal your\nsins to men; lay open your conscience in the presence of God. Show your\nwounds to the Lord, who is the best physician, and implore a remedy from\nhim; show them to him, who upbraideth not, but most mercifully heals.”\nAgain: “You certainly should not tell it to a man, lest he reproach you;\nnor is confession to be made to a fellow‐servant, who may publish it; but\nshow your wounds to the Lord, who exercises his care over you, and is a\nmost merciful physician.” He afterwards introduces God, speaking thus: “I\nconstrain you not to come forth into the midst of a theatre, and assemble\na multitude of witnesses; declare your sin privately to me alone, that I\nmay heal your wound.” Shall we say, that Chrysostom proceeded to such a\ndegree of temerity, when he wrote those and similar passages, as to\nliberate the consciences of men from obligations imposed on them by the\nDivine law? Certainly not. But he dares not to require as necessary what\nhe knows is never prescribed in the word of God.\nIX. But to place the whole subject in a more plain and familiar light, we\nwill first faithfully state what kind of confession is taught in the word\nof God; and then we will subjoin an account of those inventions of the\nPapists, not indeed of all, (for who could exhaust that immense ocean?)\nbut only of those which comprise the substance of their doctrine\nrespecting secret confession. Here it grieves me to mention, how\nfrequently the old translator has translated confess instead of praise;\nwhich is well known even to the most unlearned; only it is necessary to\nexpose their audacity, in transferring to their own tyrannical edict what\nwas written with reference to the praises of God. To prove the virtue of\nconfession to exhilarate the mind, they produce this passage from the\nPsalmist: “With the voice of exultation and confession.”(1703) But if such\na metamorphosis of the passage be admitted, we shall be able to infer any\nthing from any thing. But since they are thus lost to all sense of shame,\nlet the pious reader remember, that they have been consigned over to a\nreprobate mind by the righteous vengeance of God, to render their\npresumption the more detestable. If we are satisfied with the simple\ndoctrine of the Scripture, we shall be in no danger of being deluded by\nsuch fallacies; for there one method of confession is prescribed; which\nis, that since it is the Lord who forgives, forgets, and obliterates sins,\nwe should confess our sins to him, that we may obtain pardon. He is a\nphysician; to him, then, let us discover our wounds. He is injured and\noffended; let us pray to him for peace. He is the searcher of hearts, and\nprivy to all thoughts; let us hasten to pour out our hearts before him.\nFinally, it is he who calls sinners; let us not delay to approach him.\nDavid says, “I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not\nhid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou\nforgavest the iniquity of my sin.”(1704) Similar to this is another\nconfession of David: “Have mercy upon me, O God, according unto the\nmultitude of thy tender mercies.”(1705) Such, also, is the confession of\nDaniel: “We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done\nwickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts.”(1706)\nAnd such are the other confessions, which frequently occur in the\nScriptures, the recital of which would almost fill a volume. John says,\n“If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our\nsins.”(1707) To whom must we confess? To him, certainly; and this we do,\nif we prostrate ourselves before him with a distressed and humbled heart;\nif we sincerely accuse and condemn ourselves in his presence, and pray to\nbe pardoned by his goodness and mercy.\nX. Whoever from the heart makes this confession before God, will also,\nwithout doubt, have a tongue prepared for confession, as often as it shall\nbe necessary to proclaim the Divine mercy among men; and not only to\nwhisper the secret of his mind once into the ear of an individual, but\nfrequently and publicly, and in the hearing of the whole world,\ningenuously to declare, both his own ignominy, and the magnificence and\nglory of God. In this manner, when David was reproved by Nathan, he felt\ncompunction of conscience, and confessed his sin both to God and to men:\n“I have sinned (said he) against the Lord;”(1708) that is, I now make no\nexcuse, nor use the least subterfuge to prevent all men from condemning me\nas a sinner, and what I wished to conceal from the Lord, from being\nrevealed also to men. The secret confession, therefore, which is made to\nGod, is followed by a voluntary confession before men, whenever it\ncontributes either to the Divine glory or to our humiliation. For this\nreason, the Lord anciently enjoined upon the Israelites, that all the\npeople should confess their iniquities publicly in the temple, by the\nmouth of the priest.(1709) For he foresaw this assistance to be necessary\nfor them, to bring every person to a proper view of himself. And it is\nreasonable, that, by the confession of our misery, we should glorify the\ngoodness and mercy of God, both among ourselves and before the whole\nworld.\nXI. This kind of confession ought to be both ordinary, in the Church; and\nextraordinary, to be practised in a particular manner whenever the people\nat large are chargeable with the guilt of any common crime. We have an\nexample of the latter in that solemn confession which was made by all the\npeople under the auspices of Ezra and Nehemiah. For as their long exile,\nthe destruction of their city and temple, and the subversion of their\nreligion, were punishments of the common defection of all, they could not\nproperly acknowledge the blessing of deliverance, unless they had first\nconfessed their guilt. Nor is it of any importance if, in a congregation,\nthere be sometimes a few innocent persons; for as they are members of a\nlanguid and diseased body, they ought not to boast of health. Nor is it\npossible, indeed, but they must contract some of the pollution, and\nsustain part of the guilt. Therefore, whenever we are afflicted with\npestilence, or war, or sterility, or any other calamity, if it be our duty\nto resort to mourning, to fasting, and other expressions of\nguilt,—confession itself, on which all these other things depend, ought by\nno means to be neglected. The ordinary confession is not only recommended\nfrom the mouth of the Lord, but no judicious man, who has considered its\nusefulness, will venture to condemn it. For since, in every religious\nassembly, we introduce ourselves into the presence of God and angels, how\nshall we commence our services, except by an acknowledgment of our\nunworthiness? But this, you will say, is done in every prayer; for\nwhenever we pray for pardon, we make a confession of our sins. This I\nacknowledge. But, if you consider our extreme carelessness, or drowsiness,\nor stupidity, you will admit to me, that it would be a salutary\nregulation, if the generality of Christians were accustomed to humble\nthemselves by some solemn act of confession. For though the ceremony,\nwhich the Lord enjoined on the Israelites, was a part of the tutelage of\nthe law, yet the thing itself, in some measure, belongs also to us. And,\nindeed, we see that in all well‐regulated churches this custom is\nadvantageously observed; that on every Lord’s day the minister makes a\nformal confession, in which he represents all as guilty of sin, and\nsupplicates pardon from the Lord on behalf of all. Finally, by this key\nthe gate of prayer is opened, both to individuals in private, and in\npublic to all the congregation.\nXII. Moreover, the Scripture sanctions two kinds of private confession;\none to be made for our own sake, which is referred to in the direction of\nJames, that we should “confess our faults one to another;”(1710) for he\nmeans, that, revealing our infirmities to one another, we should assist\neach other with mutual advice and consolation; another, which is to be\nmade for the sake of our neighbour, to pacify and reconcile him to us, if\nwe have done him any injury. In the former species of confession, though\nJames, by not expressly appointing any one into whose bosom we should\ndisburden ourselves, leaves us quite at liberty to confess to any member\nof the church who shall appear most suitable; yet, since the pastors must\ngenerally be considered more proper than others, we ought chiefly to make\nchoice of them. I say that they are more suitable than others, since, in\ntheir very vocation to the ministry, they are designated by the Lord, to\ninstruct us to subdue and correct our sins, and to console us with a\nconfidence of pardon. For though the office of mutual admonition and\nreproof is committed to all, yet it is especially confided to ministers.\nAnd so, while we all ought mutually to console and confirm each other in a\nconfidence of the Divine mercy, yet we see, that ministers are constituted\nwitnesses and sureties of it, that they may afford our consciences a\nstronger assurance of the remission of sins; insomuch that they themselves\nare said to remit sins and to loose souls.(1711) When you find this\nattributed to them, consider that it is for your benefit. Therefore, let\nevery believer remember that it is his duty, if he feels such secret\nanguish or affliction from a sense of his sins, that he cannot extricate\nhimself without some exterior aid, not to neglect the remedy offered him\nby the Lord; which is, that in order to alleviate his distress, he should\nuse private confession with his pastor, and, to obtain consolation, should\nprivately implore his assistance, whose office it is, both publicly and\nprivately, to comfort the people of God with the doctrine of the gospel.\nBut we should always observe such a degree of moderation, as to lay no\nyoke on the conscience, where God has given no positive command. Hence it\nfollows, that such confession ought to be free, so as not to be required\nof all, but only to be recommended to those who conceive themselves to\nneed it. It follows also, that they who practise it on account of their\nneed of it, should neither be compelled by any precept, nor be induced by\nany artifice, to enumerate all their sins; but only so far as they shall\nthink beneficial to themselves, that they may receive solid consolation.\nFaithful pastors ought not only to leave the churches in possession of\nthis liberty, but also to defend and vindicate it with all their power, if\nthey wish to preserve their ministry from tyranny, and the people from\nsuperstition.\nXIII. Concerning the other species of confession, Christ says, in the\nGospel of Matthew, “If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there\nrememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift\nbefore the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and\nthen come and offer thy gift.”(1712) Thus is that charity, which has been\nbroken by our offence, to be repaired by acknowledging the fault we have\ncommitted, and imploring forgiveness. In this kind is comprehended the\nconfession of those who have sinned to the offence of the whole Church.\nFor, if Christ esteems the private offence of one man of such importance,\nas to prohibit from the sacred ordinances all those who have sinned\nagainst their brethren till they have been restored to favour by an\nadequate satisfaction,—how much stronger is the reason, that he who, by\nany evil example, has injured the whole Church, should reconcile it to\nhimself by an acknowledgment of his guilt! Thus was the Corinthian\nreadmitted to the communion, after having submitted to reproof.(1713) This\nmode of confession is stated by Cyprian to have been practised in the\nancient Church. “They repent (says he) in due time; and afterwards they\ncome to confession; and by the imposition of the hands of the bishop and\nclergy, they receive a right to communion.” The Scripture knows nothing of\nany other method or form of confession; and it is not our province to\nimpose new chains on men’s consciences, which Christ most strictly forbids\nto reduce under the yoke of bondage. But that the sheep should present\nthemselves to their pastor, whenever they desire to partake of the sacred\nsupper, I am so far from opposing, that I earnestly wish it were\nuniversally observed. For those who experience distress of conscience may\nreceive singular benefit from such an interview; and those who require to\nbe admonished, will thus afford an opportunity for admonitions; provided\nthat care be always taken to guard against tyranny and superstition.\nXIV. The power of the keys is exercised in these three kinds of\nconfession: either when the whole church implores pardon by a solemn\nacknowledgment of its transgressions; or when an individual, who, by any\nremarkable crime, has occasioned a common offence, declares his\nrepentance; or when he who needs the assistance of the minister on account\nof the disquietude of his conscience, discloses his infirmity to him. The\nremoval of an offence proceeds on a different principle; because, though\nit is also designed to produce peace of conscience, yet the principal end\nis, that animosity may be destroyed, and the minds of men united in the\nbonds of peace. But this advantage, which I have mentioned, is by no means\nto be despised, that we may confess our sins with the greater readiness.\nFor, when the whole church stands, as it were, before the tribunal of God,\nwhen they confess themselves guilty, and have no refuge but in the Divine\nmercy,—it is no mean or trivial consolation to have Christ’s ambassador\npresent, furnished with the mandate of reconciliation, by whom they may\nhave their absolution pronounced. Here the usefulness of the keys is\ndeservedly celebrated, when this embassy is rightly performed, with\nbecoming order and reverence. So, when he who had, in some measure,\nalienated himself from the Church, is pardoned and restored to the unity\nof the brethren, how great a blessing does he experience in knowing\nhimself to be forgiven by them, to whom Christ has said, “Whose soever\nsins ye shall remit on earth, they shall be remitted in heaven!”(1714) Nor\nis private absolution less efficacious or beneficial, when it is requested\nby those who need a particular remedy for the relief of their infirmities.\nFor it frequently happens, that he who hears the general promises, which\nare addressed to the whole congregation of believers, nevertheless remains\nin some suspense, and his mind is still disquieted with doubts of the\nforgiveness of his sins. The same person, if he discloses to his pastor\nthe secret distress of his mind, and hears this language of the gospel\nparticularly directed to him, “Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven\nthee,”(1715) will encourage his mind to an assurance, and will be\nliberated from that trepidation with which he was before disturbed. But\nwhen we are treating of the keys, we must always be cautious not to dream\nof any power distinct from the preaching of the gospel. This subject will\nagain be discussed more fully in another place, where we shall have to\ntreat of the government of the Church; and there we shall see, that all\nthe power of binding and loosing, which Christ has conferred on the\nChurch, is inseparable from the word. But this is chiefly applicable to\nthe ministry of the keys, the whole force and meaning of which consist in\nthis, that the grace of the gospel should be confirmed and sealed, as it\nwere, to the minds of the faithful, in public as well as private, by those\nwhom the Lord has ordained to this office; which cannot be done but by\npreaching alone.\nXV. But what is the doctrine of the Romish divines? They maintain, that\nall persons, of both sexes, as soon as they shall have arrived at years of\ndiscretion, should, once at least in every year, confess all their sins to\ntheir own priest; that there is no remission of sin, unless they have\nfirmly resolved to confess it; that unless they fulfil this resolution,\nwhen opportunity offers, there is no admittance for them into Paradise;\nand, moreover, that the priest has the power of the keys, with which he\nmay loose the sinner or bind him; because Christ has not said in vain,\n“Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.”(1716) But\nconcerning this power, they have obstinate contentions among themselves.\nSome say, that there is essentially but one key, namely, the power of\nbinding and loosing; that knowledge is required, indeed, for the good use\nof it, but that it is only like an accessory, not an essential\nconcomitant. Others, perceiving this to be too unlimited a license, have\nmentioned two keys, discretion and power. Others, again, observing that\nthe wickedness of the priests was restrained by such moderation, have\ninvented other keys, an authority of discerning which they might use in\npronouncing decisions; and a power, which they might exert in executing\ntheir sentences; with knowledge, to assist as a counsellor. But they\nventure not to explain this binding and loosing simply to mean, forgiving\nand obliterating sins; because they hear the Lord proclaiming by the\nprophet, “I am the Lord, and beside me there is no Saviour. I, even I, am\nhe which blotteth out thy transgressions.”(1717) But they say, that it\nbelongs to the priest to pronounce who are bound or loosed, and to declare\nwhose sins are remitted or retained; and that he declares it, either by\nconfession, when he absolves and retains sins; or by his sentence, when he\nexcommunicates, and when he receives to the communion of the sacraments.\nLastly, when they perceive that they are not yet extricated from this\ndifficulty, but that it may always be objected, that their priests\nfrequently bind and loose improper persons, who are not therefore bound or\nloosed in heaven,—as their last resource, they reply, that the commission\nof the keys must be understood with some limitation, Christ having\npromised, that the sentence of the priest, which has been justly\ndelivered, according to the merits of the persons bound or loosed, shall\nbe confirmed at his tribunal. They add also, that these keys were given by\nChrist to all priests, who receive them from the bishops on their\npromotion to the sacerdotal office; but that the free use of them belongs\nonly to those who exercise ecclesiastical functions; that the keys\nthemselves remain, indeed, with the excommunicated or suspended ones, but\nthat they are rusty and disused. And those who advance these things may\njustly be considered modest and sober, in comparison with others, who, on\na new anvil, have fabricated new keys, with which they tell us the\ntreasure of the Church is locked up; which we shall examine in the proper\nplace.\nXVI. I shall briefly reply to each of these things; though without\nnoticing, at present, the justice or injustice with which they bind the\nsouls of the faithful by their laws; as that will be considered in due\norder. But when they impose a law respecting the enumeration of all sins;\nwhen they deny that sin is forgiven, but on condition that a firm\nresolution has been formed to confess it; when they say that there remains\nno entrance into Paradise, if the opportunity of confession has been\nneglected,—this is altogether intolerable. Must all sins be enumerated?\nDavid, who (I suppose) had often meditated the confession of his sins,\nnevertheless exclaimed, “Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me\nfrom secret faults.”(1718) And in another place: “Mine iniquities are gone\nover mine head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.”(1719) He had\njust apprehensions of the vast abyss of our sins, of the numerous species\nof our crimes, of the many heads this monster bore, and the long tail it\ndrew after it. Therefore he attempted not to detail his transgressions,\nbut from the abyss of his distresses cried to the Lord. “I am afflicted\nand ready to die; my spirit is overwhelmed within me; I dwell in darkness,\nas those that have been long dead;”(1720) “the sorrows of death compassed\nme, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me;”(1721) “I sink in deep mire;\ndeliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink.”(1722) Who can now think\nof recounting his sins, when he sees that David was unable to enter on an\nenumeration of his?\nXVII. The souls of those who have been affected with any discoveries of\nGod, have been most cruelly tormented by this fatal delusion. First, they\ncalled themselves to an account; they divided sins into boughs, branches,\ntwigs, and leaves, according to the distinctions of these confessors: then\nthey examined the qualities, quantities, and circumstances; and the\nbusiness made some little progress. But, when they had advanced further,\nthey were surrounded on all sides by the sea and the sky, no port, no\nhaven in prospect; the more they had passed over, the greater mass was\nalways accumulating on their view; they beheld, as it were, lofty\nmountains rising before them, and no time or labour seemed to encourage\nthe least hope of escaping. Thus they remained in extreme distress, and\nafter all, found it terminate in nothing but despair. Then the remedy\napplied by those cruel murderers, to alleviate the wounds which they had\nmade, was, that every one should do to the uttermost of his ability. But\nnew cares again disturbed, and new agonies again excruciated, these\nmiserable souls: I have not devoted sufficient time; I have not applied\nwith proper diligence; I have omitted many things through negligence, and\nthe forgetfulness which arises from negligence is inexcusable. To assuage\nsuch pains, other remedies were now added: Repent of your negligence; if\nit be not too great, it will be forgiven. But all these things cannot heal\nthe wound; nor do they act as alleviations of the malady, but rather as\npoisons concealed in honey, that they may not by their harshness offend at\nthe first taste, but may penetrate into the inmost parts before they are\nperceived. This terrible injunction, therefore, is always pursuing them\nand resounding in their ears: “Confess all your sins;” nor can that terror\nbe appeased but by some certain consolation. Here let the reader consider\nthe possibility of taking an account of the actions of a whole year, and\nselecting the sins of every day; since experience convinces every man\nthat, when at evening he comes to examine the delinquencies of only one\nday, his memory is confounded by their great multitude and variety. I\nspeak not of stupid hypocrites, who, if they have noticed three or four\ngross sins, imagine they have discharged their duty; but of the true\nworshippers of God, who, when they find themselves overwhelmed with the\nexamination they have made, conclude, in the language of John, “If our\nheart condemn us, God is greater than our heart.”(1723) They tremble,\ntherefore, before that Judge, whose knowledge far exceeds our\napprehension.\nXVIII. The acquiescence of a great part of the world in such soothing\narts, employed to temper this mortal poison, was not indulged from a\nbelief that God was satisfied, or because they were altogether satisfied\nthemselves; but that, like mariners, having cast anchor in the midst of\nthe sea, they might enjoy a short respite from the toils of navigation, or\nlike a fatigued and fainting traveller, might lie down in the road. I\nshall not take much trouble to establish this point for every man may be\nhis own witness of it. I will briefly state the nature of this law. First,\nit is absolutely impracticable; therefore it can only destroy, condemn,\nconfound, and precipitate into ruin and despair. In the next place, it\ndiverts sinners from a true sense of their sins, and makes them\nhypocrites, ignorant both of God and themselves. For while they are wholly\nemployed in enumerating their sins, they forget, in the mean time, that\nlatent source of vices, their secret iniquities and inward pollutions, a\nknowledge of which is above all things necessary to a consideration of\ntheir misery. But the most certain rule of confession is to acknowledge\nand confess the abyss of our guilt to be vast beyond all our\ncomprehension. The publican’s confession appears to have been composed\naccording to this rule—“God be merciful to me a sinner.”(1724) As though\nhe had said, “All that I am is utterly sinful; I cannot reach the\nmagnitude of my sins, either with my tongue or with my mind; let the abyss\nof thy mercy swallow up this abyss of sin.” But you will say, Are not\nparticular sins, then, to be confessed? Is no confession accepted by God\nunless it be comprised in these precise words, “I am a sinner?” I reply,\nthat we should rather endeavour, as far as we possibly can, to pour out\nour whole heart before the Lord; and not only confess ourselves sinners in\na single expression, but truly and cordially acknowledge ourselves such;\nand consider in all our reflections, how great and various is the\npollution of sin; not only that we are unclean, but the nature and extent\nof our impurity; not only that we are debtors, but the magnitude and\nnumber of the debts with which we are burdened; not only that we are\nwounded, but what a multitude of mortal wounds we have received. Yet when\nthe sinner has wholly unbosomed himself before God in this acknowledgment,\nlet him seriously and sincerely reflect, that more sins still remain, and\nthat the secret recesses of his guilt are too deep to be entirely\ndisclosed. And therefore let him exclaim with David, “Who can understand\nhis errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults.”(1725) Now, when they\naffirm, that sins are not forgiven without a strong resolution having been\nformed to confess them, and that the gate of Paradise is shut against him\nwho has neglected an opportunity afforded him of confessing,—far be it\nfrom us to make them such a concession. For there is no other remission of\nsins now than there always has been. Among all those who are said to have\nobtained remission of sins from Christ, none are said to have made a\nconfession in the ear of any priest. Nor, indeed, was it possible for them\nthus to confess, when there were no confessionary priests, and confession\nitself was altogether unknown. And this confession was unheard of for many\nages after, during which sins were forgiven without this condition. But,\nnot to debate any longer as respecting a doubtful point, “the word of God\nwhich abideth for ever,”(1726) is perfectly clear: “If the wicked will\nturn from all his sins, all his transgressions that he hath committed,\nthey shall not be mentioned unto him.”(1727) He who presumes to make any\naddition to this declaration, does not bind sins, but limits the mercy of\nGod. When they contend that judgment cannot be given without a trial of\nthe cause, we are prepared with an answer—that they are guilty of arrogant\npresumption in creating themselves judges. And it is surprising that they\nso securely fabricate principles for themselves, which no man of sound\nunderstanding will admit. They boast that the office of binding and\nloosing is committed to them, as though it were a kind of jurisdiction\nannexed to examination. That the apostles were strangers to this\nauthority, their whole doctrine proclaims; and to know certainly whether\nthe sinner be loosed, belongs not to the priest, but to Him of whom\nabsolution is implored; since the priest who bears the confession, can\nnever know whether the enumeration of sins be true and perfect. Thus there\nwould be no absolution, but what must be restricted to the words of the\nperson to be judged. Besides, the loosing of sins depends entirely on\nfaith and repentance; which both elude the knowledge of man, when sentence\nis to be given respecting another. It follows, therefore, that the\ncertainty of binding and loosing is not subject to the decision of an\nearthly judge; because a minister, in the legitimate execution of his\noffice, can pronounce only a conditional absolution; but that the\ndeclaration, “_Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted_,” is spoken\nfor the sake of sinners, to preclude every doubt that the pardon, which is\npromised according to the command and word of God, will be ratified in\nheaven.\nXIX. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if we condemn and desire the\ntotal removal of this auricular confession—a thing so pestilent, and in so\nmany respects injurious to the Church. Even if it were a thing\nabstractedly indifferent, yet, since it is of no use or benefit, but has\noccasioned so much impiety, sacrilege, and error,—who can refuse to admit,\nthat it ought to be immediately abolished? They mention, indeed, some\nuses, which they boast of as very beneficial; but these are mere fictions,\nor productive of no advantage whatever. One circumstance they state as a\npeculiar recommendation, that the shame of the person who confesses is a\ngrievous punishment, by which the sinner is rendered more cautious in\nfuture, and prevents the vengeance of God by punishing himself. As though\nwe humble not a man with a sufficient degree of shame, when we summon him\nto the supreme tribunal of heaven—to the cognizance of God! It is a\nwonderful advantage, indeed, if we cease to sin through a shame of one\nman, but are never ashamed of having God for a witness of our evil\nconscience! Though this very notion is utterly false; for it is\nuniversally observable, that nothing produces a greater confidence or\nlicentiousness in sinning, than the idea entertained by some men, after\nthey have made their confession to a priest, that they may “wipe their\nmouth and say, I have done no wickedness.”(1728) And they not only become\nmore presumptuous in their sins throughout the year, but, having no\nconcern about confession for the rest of the year, they never aspire after\nGod, they never retire into themselves, but accumulate sins upon sins,\ntill they disembogue them, as they imagine, all at once. But when they\nhave done this, they conceive themselves to be exonerated of their burden,\nand to have transferred from God the judgment they have conferred on the\npriest; and that they have deprived God of remembrance, by the information\nthey have communicated to the priest. Besides, who rejoices to see the day\nof confession approaching? Who goes to confess with alacrity of heart; and\ndoes not rather come with unwillingness and reluctance, as though he were\nforcibly dragged to a prison; except perhaps the priests, who pleasantly\nentertain themselves with mutual narrations of their exploits, as with\nhumorous anecdotes? I will not soil much paper by relating the monstrous\nabominations with which auricular confession abounds. I only remark, if\nthat holy man was not guilty of indiscretion, who, on account of one\nrumour of fornication, banished confession from his church, or rather from\nthe memory of his people,—we are thus reminded of what ought to be done in\nthe present day, when rapes, adulteries, incests, and seductions exceed\nall enumeration.\nXX. As the advocates of confession plead the power of the keys, and rest\nupon it all the merits of their cause, we must examine the weight that is\ndue to this argument. Are the keys, then, (say they,) given without any\nreason? Is it without any cause that it is said, “Whatsoever ye shall\nloose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven?”(1729) Do we, then, frustrate\nthe declaration of Christ? I reply, that there was an important reason why\nthe keys should be given; as I have already stated, and shall again more\nexplicitly show, when I come to treat of excommunication. But what if I\nrefute the whole of their pretensions with one argument, that their\npriests are not vicars, or successors of the apostles? But this, also,\nwill be discussed in another place. Now, they set up, as their principal\ndefence, an engine by which their whole structure may be completely\ndemolished. For Christ never conferred on his apostles the power of\nbinding and loosing, till after he had given them the Holy Ghost. I deny,\ntherefore, that the power of the keys belongs to any, who have not\npreviously received the Holy Ghost. I deny that any one can use the keys,\nunless the Spirit guide and instruct him, and direct him how he ought to\nact. They impertinently pretend, that they have the Holy Ghost; but in\nreality they deny it; unless perhaps they imagine, as they certainly do,\nthat the Holy Ghost is a useless and worthless thing; but they will not be\nbelieved. By this weapon they are completely vanquished. Of whatever door\nthey pretend to have the key, they should always be asked, whether they\nhave the Holy Ghost, who is the arbiter and governor of the keys. If they\nreply in the affirmative, they must be questioned again, whether it be\npossible for the Holy Ghost to err. This they will not dare expressly to\navow, though they obliquely insinuate it in their doctrine. We may justly\ninfer, therefore, that no priests have the power of the keys, who, without\ndiscrimination, frequently loose what the Lord had designed to be bound,\nand bind what he had commanded to be loosed.\nXXI. When they find themselves convinced, by evident experience, that they\npromiscuously loose and bind the worthy and the unworthy, they arrogate to\nthemselves the power without knowledge. And though they dare not deny that\nknowledge is requisite to a good use of it, yet they tell us, that the\npower itself is committed to improper dispensers of it. But this is the\npower—“Whatsoever thou bindest or loosest on earth, shall be bound or\nloosed in heaven.” Either the promise of Christ must be false, or the\nbinding and loosing is rightly performed by those who are endued with this\npower. Nor is there any room for them to quibble, that the declaration of\nChrist is limited according to the merits of the person that is bound or\nloosed. We also acknowledge, that none can be bound or loosed, but such as\nare worthy to be bound or loosed. But the preachers of the gospel, and the\nChurch, have the word as the standard of this worthiness. In this word,\nthe ministers of the gospel may promise to all remission of sins in Christ\nthrough faith; they may denounce damnation against all and upon all who\nreceive not Christ. In this word, the Church pronounces, that fornicators,\nadulterers, thieves, murderers, misers, and extortioners, have no part in\nthe kingdom of God; and binds such with the firmest bonds. In the same\nword, the Church looses and comforts those who repent.(1730) But what kind\nof power will it be, not to know what ought to be bound or loosed? and not\nto be able to bind or loose without this knowledge? Why, then, do they\nsay, that they absolve by the authority committed to them, when their\nabsolution is uncertain? Why should we concern ourselves about this\nimaginary power, if it be quite useless? But I have already ascertained,\neither that it has no existence, or that it is too uncertain to be\nconsidered of any value. For, as they confess that there are many of the\npriests who make no right use of the keys, and that the power has no\nefficacy without a legitimate use of it, who will assure me, that he by\nwhom I am loosed is a good dispenser of the keys? But if he be a bad one,\nwhat else does he possess but this frivolous dispensation of them: “What\nought to be bound or loosed in you, I know not, since I am destitute of\nthe proper use of the keys; but if you deserve it, I absolve you?” But as\nmuch as this might be done, I will not say by a layman, (since they could\nnot hear that with any patience,) but by a Turk or a devil. For it is\nequivalent to saying, “I have not the word of God, which is the certain\nrule of loosing; but I am invested with authority to absolve you, on\ncondition that your merits deserve it.” We see, then, what they intended,\nwhen they defined the keys to be an authority of discerning, and a power\nof executing, attended with knowledge as a counsellor, to promote the good\nuse. The truth is, that they wished to reign according to their own\nlicentious inclinations, independently of God and his word.\nXXII. If it be objected, that the legitimate ministers of Christ will be\nequally perplexed in their office, since the absolution, which depends on\nfaith, will ever be doubtful, and that therefore sinners will have but a\nslight consolation, or none at all, since the minister himself, who is not\na competent judge of their faith, is not certain of their absolution,—we\nare prepared with an answer. They say, that no sins are remitted by the\npriest, but those which fall under his cognizance; thus, according to\nthem, remission depends on the judgment of the priest; and unless he\nsagaciously discerns who are worthy of pardon, the whole transaction is\nfrivolous and useless. In short, the power of which they speak is a\njurisdiction annexed to examination, to which pardon and absolution are\nrestricted. In this statement, we find no firm footing, but rather a\nbottomless abyss; for where the confession is deficient, the hope of\npardon is also imperfect; in the next place, the priest himself must\nnecessarily remain in suspense, while he is ignorant whether the sinner\nfaithfully enumerates all his crimes; lastly, such is the ignorance and\ninexperience of priests, that the majority of them are no more qualified\nfor the exercise of this office, than a shoemaker for cultivating the\nground; and almost all the rest ought justly to be suspicious of\nthemselves. Hence, then, the perplexity and doubtfulness of the Papal\nabsolution, because they maintain it to be founded on the person of the\npriest; and not only so, but on his knowledge, so that he can only judge\nof what he hears, examines, and ascertains. Now, should any one inquire of\nthese good doctors, whether a sinner be reconciled to God on the remission\nof part of his sins, I know not what answer they can give, without being\nconstrained to acknowledge the inefficacy of whatever the priest may\npronounce concerning the remission of sins which he has heard enumerated,\nas long as the guilt of others still remains. What a pernicious anxiety\nmust oppress the conscience of the person that confesses, appears from\nthis consideration, that while he relies on the discretion of the priest,\n(as they express themselves,) he decides nothing by the word of God. The\ndoctrine maintained by us, is perfectly free from all these absurdities.\nFor absolution is conditional, in such a way, that the sinner may be\nconfident that God is propitious to him, provided he sincerely seeks an\natonement in the sacrifice of Christ, and relies upon the grace offered to\nhim. Thus it is impossible for him to err, who, according to his duty as a\npreacher, promulgates what he has been taught by the Divine word; and the\nsinner may receive a certain and clear absolution, simply on condition of\nembracing the grace of Christ, according to that general rule of our Lord\nhimself, which has been impiously despised among the Papists—“According to\nyour faith be it unto you.”(1731)\nXXIII. Their absurd confusion of the clear representations of the\nScripture concerning the power of the keys, I have promised to expose in\nanother place; and a more suitable opportunity will present itself, in\ndiscussing the government of the Church. But let the reader remember, that\nthey preposterously pervert to auricular and secret confession, passages\nwhich are spoken by Christ, partly of the preaching of the gospel, and\npartly of excommunication. Wherefore, when they object that the power of\nloosing was committed to the apostles, which is now exercised by the\npriests in remitting the sins confessed to them, it is evidently an\nassumption of a false and frivolous principle; for the absolution\nconsequent on faith, is nothing but a declaration of pardon taken from the\ngracious promise of the gospel; but the other absolution, which depends on\necclesiastical discipline, relates not to secret sins, but is rather for\nthe sake of example, that the public offence of the Church may be removed.\nThey rake together testimonies from every quarter, to prove, that it is\nnot sufficient to make a confession of sins to God, or to laymen, unless\nthey are likewise submitted to the cognizance of a priest; but they ought\nto be ashamed of such a disgusting employment. For, if the ancient fathers\nsometimes persuade sinners to disburden themselves to their own pastor, it\ncannot be understood of a particular enumeration of sins, which was not\nthen practised. Moreover, Lombard and others of the same class have been\nso unfair, that they appear to have designedly consulted spurious books,\nin order to use them as a pretext to deceive the unwary. They do, indeed,\nproperly acknowledge, that since loosing always accompanies repentance,\nthere really remains no bond where any one has experienced repentance,\nalthough he may not yet have made a confession; and, therefore, that then\nthe priest does not so much remit sins, as pronounce and declare them to\nbe remitted. Though in the word _declare_ they insinuate a gross error,\nsubstituting a ceremony in the place of instruction; but by adding, that\nhe who had already obtained pardon before God, is absolved in the view of\nthe Church, they unseasonably apply to the particular use of every\nindividual, what we have already asserted to have been appointed as a part\nof the common discipline of the Church, when the offence of some great and\nnotorious crime requires to be removed. But they presently corrupt and\ndestroy all the moderation they had observed, by adding another mode of\nremission, that is, with an injunction of punishment and satisfaction; by\nwhich they arrogantly ascribe to their priests the power of dividing into\ntwo parts what God has every where promised as complete. For, as he simply\nrequires repentance and faith, this partition or exception is an evident\nsacrilege. For it is just as if the priest, sustaining the character of a\ntribune, should interpose his _veto_, and not suffer God of his mere\ngoodness to receive any one into favour, unless he had lain prostrate\nbefore the tribunitial seat, and there been punished.\nXXIV. The whole argument comes to this—that if they will represent God as\nthe author of this fictitious confession, it is a full proof of their\nerror; for I have pointed out their fallacies in the few passages which\nthey quote. But since it is evident that this is a law of human\nimposition, I assert that it is also tyrannical and injurious to God, who\nbinds the consciences of men by his word, and whose will it is that they\nshould be free from the authority of men. Now, when they prescribe as a\nnecessary prerequisite to pardon that which God has chosen should be free,\nI maintain that it is an intolerable sacrilege; for nothing is more\npeculiarly the prerogative of God than the remission of sins, in which our\nsalvation consists. I have moreover proved, that this tyranny was not\nintroduced till the world was oppressed with the rudest barbarism. I have\nlikewise shown that it is a pestilent law, because, if wretched souls are\naffected with the fear of God, it precipitates them into despair; or if\nthey are in a state of careless security, it soothes them with vain\nflatteries, and renders them still more insensible. Lastly, I have stated,\nthat all the mitigations which they add, have no other tendency than to\nperplex, obscure, and corrupt the pure doctrine, and to conceal their\nimpieties under false and illusive colours.\nXXV. The third place in repentance they assign to _satisfaction_; all\ntheir jargon concerning which may be overturned in one word. They say,\nthat it is not sufficient for a penitent to abstain from his former sins,\nand to change his morals for the better, unless he make satisfaction to\nGod for the crimes which he has committed; and that there are many helps\nby which we may redeem sins, such as tears, fastings, oblations, and works\nof charity; that by these the Lord is to be propitiated, by these our\ndebts are to be paid to the Divine justice, by these we must compensate\nfor the guilt of our sins, by these we must merit pardon; for that though,\nin the plenitude of his mercy, he has remitted our sins, yet, in the\ndiscipline of justice, he retains the punishment, and that this is the\npunishment which must be redeemed by _satisfactions_. All that they say,\nhowever, comes to this conclusion—that we obtain the pardon of our\ntransgressions from the mercy of God, but that it is by the intervention\nof the merit of works, by which the evil of our sins must be compensated,\nthat the Divine justice may receive the satisfaction which is due to it.\nTo such falsehoods I oppose the gratuitous remission of sins, than which\nthere is nothing more clearly revealed in the Scripture. In the first\nplace, what is remission, but a gift of mere liberality? For the creditor\nis not said to forgive, who testifies by a receipt that the debt has been\npaid, but he who, without any payment, merely through his beneficence,\nvoluntarily cancels the obligation. In the next place, why is this said to\nbe free, but to preclude every idea of satisfaction? With what confidence,\nthen, can they still set up their satisfactions, which are overthrown by\nsuch a mighty thunderbolt? But when the Lord proclaims by Isaiah, “I, even\nI, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will\nnot remember thy sins,”(1732) does he not evidently declare, that he\nderives the cause and foundation of forgiveness merely from his own\ngoodness? Besides, while the whole Scripture bears testimony to Christ,\nthat “remission of sins” is to be “received through his name,”(1733) does\nit not exclude all other names? How, then, do they teach, that it is\nreceived through the name of _satisfactions_? Nor can they deny that they\nascribe this to satisfactions, although they call their intervention\n_subsidiary_. For when the Scripture states it to be “through the name of\nChrist,” it signifies, that we bring nothing, that we plead nothing, of\nour own, but rely solely on the mediation of Christ; as Paul, after\naffirming, “that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not\nimputing their trespasses unto them,” immediately adds the method and\nnature of it, “for he hath made him, who knew no sin, to be sin for\nus.”(1734)\nXXVI. But such is their perverseness, they reply that both remission of\nsins and reconciliation are obtained at once, when in baptism we are\nreceived into the favour of God, through Christ; that if we fall after\nbaptism, we are to be raised up again by _satisfactions_; and that the\nblood of Christ avails us nothing, any further than it is dispensed by the\nkeys of the Church. I am not speaking of a doubtful point, for they have\nbetrayed their impurity in the most explicit terms; and this is the case\nnot only of two or three, but of all the schoolmen. For their master,\nLombard, after having confessed that, according to the doctrine of Peter,\nChrist suffered the punishment of sins on the cross,(1735) immediately\ncorrects that sentiment by the addition of the following exception: that\nall the temporal punishments of sins are remitted in baptism; but that\nafter baptism they are diminished by means of repentance, so that our\nrepentance coöperates with the cross of Christ. But John speaks a very\ndifferent language: “If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,\nJesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins: I\nwrite unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for\nhis name’s sake.”(1736) He certainly addresses believers, and when he\nexhibits Christ to them as the propitiation for sins, proves that there is\nno other satisfaction by which our offended God may be propitiated or\nappeased. He says not, God was once reconciled to you by Christ, now seek\nsome other means; but represents him as a perpetual advocate, who by his\nintercession restores us to the Father’s favour for ever, and as a\nperpetual propitiation by which our sins are expiated. For this is\nperpetually true, that was declared by the other John, “Behold the Lamb of\nGod, which taketh away the sins of the world.”(1737) He takes them away\nhimself, I say, and no other; that is, since he alone is the Lamb of God,\nhe alone is the oblation, the expiation, the satisfaction for sins. For\nthe right and power to forgive being the peculiar prerogative of the\nFather, as distinguished from the Son, as we have already seen, Christ is\nhere represented in another capacity, since by transferring to himself the\npunishment we deserved, he has obliterated our guilt before the throne of\nGod. Whence it follows, that we shall not be partakers of the atonement of\nChrist in any other way, unless he remain in the exclusive possession of\nthat honour, which they unjustly assume to themselves who endeavour to\nappease God by satisfactions of their own.\nXXVII. And here two things demand our consideration—that the honour, which\nbelongs to Christ, should be preserved to him entire and undiminished; and\nthat consciences assured of the pardon of their sins, should have peace\nwith God. Isaiah says, “The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,”\nand “With his stripes we are healed.”(1738) Peter, repeating the same\ntruth in different words, says, that Christ “bare our sins in his own body\non the tree.”(1739) Paul informs us, that “sin was condemned in the\nflesh,”(1740) when “Christ was made sin for us;”(1741) that is, that the\npower and curse of sin were destroyed in his flesh, when he was given as a\nvictim, to sustain the whole load of our sins, with their curse and\nexecrations, with the dreadful judgment of God, and the condemnation of\ndeath. We cannot here listen to those foolish fictions; that after the\ninitial purgation or baptism, none of us can have any further experience\nof the efficacy of the sufferings of Christ, than in proportion to a\nsatisfactory repentance. But whenever we have fallen, the Scripture\nrecalls us to the satisfaction of Christ alone. Now, review their\npestilent follies; “that the grace of God operates alone in the first\nremission of sins; but that if we afterwards fall, our works coöperate\nwith it in the impetration of a second pardon.” If these things be\nadmitted, does Christ remain exclusively possessed of what we have before\nattributed to him? How immensely wide is the difference between these\npositions—that our iniquities are laid on Christ to be expiated by him,\nand that they are expiated by our own works! that Christ is the\npropitiation for our sins, and that God must be propitiated by works! But\nwith respect to pacifying the conscience, what peace will it afford any\none, to hear that sins are redeemed by satisfactions? When will he be\nassured of the accomplishment of satisfaction? Therefore he will always\ndoubt whether God be propitious to him, he will always be in a state of\nfluctuation and terror. For those who content themselves with trivial\nsatisfactions, have too contemptuous sentiments of the judgment of God,\nand reflect very little on the vast evil of sin, as we shall elsewhere\nobserve. But though we should allow them to expiate some sins by a proper\nsatisfaction, yet what will they do when they are overwhelmed with so many\nsins, that to make adequate satisfactions for them, even a hundred lives\nentirely devoted to it could not possibly be sufficient? Besides, all the\npassages in which remission of sins is declared, are not addressed to\ncatechumens, [or persons not yet baptized,] but to the regenerated sons of\nGod, and those who have been long nurtured in the bosom of the Church.\nThat embassy which Paul so splendidly extols, “We pray you in Christ’s\nstead, be ye reconciled to God,”(1742) is directed not to strangers, but\nto those who had already been regenerated. But, dismissing all\nsatisfactions, he sends them to the cross of Christ. Thus, when he writes\nto the Colossians, that “Christ had made peace by the blood of his cross,\nand reconciled all things both in earth and in heaven,”(1743) he restricts\nnot this to the moment of our reception into the Church, but extends it\nthrough our whole course; as is evident from the context, where he says\nthat believers “have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of\nsins.” But it is unnecessary to accumulate more passages, which are\nfrequently occurring.\nXXVIII. Here they take refuge in a foolish distinction, that some sins are\n_venial_, and some _mortal_; that a great satisfaction is due for mortal\nsins; but that those which are venial are purged away by easier remedies,\nby the Lord’s prayer, the aspersion of holy water, and the absolution of\nthe mass. Thus they sport and trifle with God. But though they are\nincessantly talking of venial and mortal sins, yet they have never been\nable to discriminate one from the other, except by making impiety and\nimpurity of heart a venial sin. But we maintain, according to the doctrine\nof the Scripture, the only standard of righteousness and sin, that “the\nwages of sin is death,” and “the soul that sinneth, it shall die;”(1744)\nbut that the sins of believers are venial, not because they are not\ndeserving of death, but because, through the mercy of God, “there is no\ncondemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus;”(1745) because they are\nnot imputed to them, but obliterated by a pardon. I know their unjust\ncalumnies against this doctrine of ours; they assert it to be the Stoical\nparadox concerning the equality of sins; but they will easily be refuted\nout of their own lips. For I ask, whether among those very sins which they\nconfess to be mortal, they do not acknowledge one to be greater or less\nthan another? It does not, therefore, immediately follow, that sins are\nequal because they are alike mortal. Since the Scripture declares that the\nwages of sin is death, that obedience to the law is the way of life, and\nthe transgression of it death, they cannot evade this decision. What end,\nthen, will they find to satisfactions in so great an accumulation of sins?\nIf it be the business of one day to satisfy for one sin, while they are\nemployed in that, they involve themselves in more; for the most righteous\nman cannot pass a single day without falling several times. While they\nshall be preparing themselves to make satisfaction for these, they will\naccumulate a numerous, or rather an innumerable multitude. Now, all\nconfidence in satisfaction is cut off: on what do they depend? How do they\nstill presume to think of making satisfaction?\nXXIX. They endeavour to extricate themselves from this difficulty, but\nwithout success. They invent a distinction between the guilt and the\npunishment; and acknowledge that the guilt is forgiven by the Divine\nmercy, but maintain, that after the remission of the guilt, there still\nremains the punishment, which the Divine justice requires to be suffered;\nand, therefore, that satisfactions properly relate to the remission of the\npunishment. What desultory levity is this! Now, they confess that\nremission of guilt is proposed as gratuitous, which they are continually\nteaching men to merit by prayers and tears, and other preparations of\nvarious kinds. But every thing delivered in the Scripture concerning\nremission of sins is diametrically opposite to this distinction. And\nthough I think I have fully established this point already, I will subjoin\nsome additional testimonies, by which our opponents will be so much\nembarrassed, as, notwithstanding all their serpentine lubricity, to be\ntotally unable ever to extricate themselves. “This is the new covenant,”\nwhich God has made with us in Christ, “that he will not remember our\niniquities.”(1746) The import of these expressions we learn from another\nprophet, by whom the Lord says, “When the righteous turneth away from his\nrighteousness, all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be\nmentioned. When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness, he shall\nsurely live, he shall not die.”(1747) “Not to mention righteousness,”\nsignifies, not to notice it so as to reward it; and “not to remember\nsins,” is, not to inflict punishment for them. This is expressed in other\npassages by the following phrases: to “cast behind the back,” to “blot out\nas a cloud,” to “cast into the depths of the sea,” “not to impute,” to\n“cover.”(1748) These forms of expression would clearly convey to us the\nsense of the Holy Spirit, if we attended to them with docility. If God\npunishes sins, he certainly imputes them; if he avenges them, he remembers\nthem; if he cites them to judgment, he does not cover them; if he examines\nthem, he has not cast them behind his back; if he inspects them, he has\nnot blotted them out as a cloud; if he scrutinizes them, he has not cast\nthem into the depths of the sea. And in this manner the subject is clearly\nexplained by Augustine. “If God has covered sins, he would not look at\nthem; if he would not look at them, he would not take cognizance of them;\nif he would not take cognizance of them, he would not punish them; he\nwould not know them, he would rather forgive them. Why, then, has he said\nthat sins are covered? That they might not be seen. For what is meant by\nGod’s seeing sin, but his punishing it?” Let us also hear from another\npassage of the prophet, on what conditions God remits sins. “Though your\nsins be as scarlet, (says he,) they shall be as white as snow; though they\nbe red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”(1749) And in Jeremiah we find\nthis declaration: “In that time the iniquities of Israel shall be sought\nfor, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be\nfound; for I will pardon them whom I reserve.”(1750) Would you briefly\nknow what is the meaning of these words? Consider, on the contrary, the\nimport of the following expressions: “the Lord seweth up iniquity in a\nbag;” “iniquity is bound up;” “sin is hid;” to “write sins with a pen of\niron, and engrave them with the point of a diamond.”(1751) If they signify\nthat God will execute vengeance, as they undoubtedly do, neither can it be\ndoubted but that, by the contrary declaration, the Lord proclaims his\nremission of all vindictive punishment. Here I must conjure my readers not\nto listen to my expositions, but only to pay some deference to the word of\nGod.\nXXX. What would Christ have done for us, if punishment for sins were still\ninflicted on us? For when we say, that he “bare all our sins in his own\nbody on the tree,”(1752) we intend only, that he sustained the vindictive\npunishment which was due to our sins. This sentiment is more significantly\nexpressed by Isaiah, when he says that the “chastisement (or correction)\nof our peace was upon him.”(1753) Now, what is the correction of our\npeace, but the punishment due to sins, and which we must have suffered\nbefore we could be reconciled to God, if he had not become our substitute?\nThus we see clearly, that Christ bore the punishment of sins, that he\nmight deliver his people from it. And whenever Paul mentions the\nredemption accomplished by him, he generally calls it ἀπολυτρωσις,(1754)\nwhich signifies not simply redemption, as it is commonly understood, but\nthe price and satisfaction of redemption. Thus he says that Christ “gave\nhimself a ransom” (αντιλυτρον) for us.(1755) “What propitiation is there\nwith the Lord (says Augustine) but sacrifice? And what sacrifice is there,\nbut that which has been offered for us in the death of Christ?” But the\ninstitutions of the law of Moses, respecting expiations for sins, furnish\nus with a most powerful argument. For there the Lord prescribes not this\nor the other method of satisfying, but requires the whole compensation in\nsacrifices; though he specifies all the rites of expiation with the most\nparticular care, and in the most exact order. How is it that he commands\nthe expiation of sins without any works at all, requiring no other\natonement than by sacrifices, but because he intends in this way to\ndeclare, that there is only one kind of satisfaction by which his justice\nis appeased? For the sacrifices then immolated by the Israelites were not\nconsidered as the works of men, but were estimated according to their\nantitype, that is, the one sacrifice of Christ alone. The nature of the\ncompensation which the Lord receives from us is concisely and beautifully\nexpressed by Hosea: “Take away (saith he) all iniquity, O Lord;” here is\nremission of sins; “so will we render the calves of our lips;”(1756) here\nis satisfaction, [which is no other than thanksgiving.] I am aware of\nanother still more subtle evasion to which they resort, by distinguishing\nbetween eternal punishments and those which are temporal. But when they\nassert that temporal punishment is any suffering inflicted by God on the\nbody or the soul, eternal death only excepted, this limitation affords\nthem but little assistance. For the passages which we have cited above,\nexpressly signify, that God receives us into favour on this condition,\nthat in forgiving our guilt, he remits all the punishment that we had\ndeserved. And whenever David or the other prophets implore the pardon of\ntheir sins, they at the same time deprecate the punishment; and to this\nthey are impelled by an apprehension of the Divine judgment. Again: when\nthey promise mercy from the Lord, they almost always professedly speak of\npunishments, and of the remission of them. Certainly when the Lord\nannounces by Ezekiel, that he will put an end to the Babylonian captivity,\nand that for his own sake, not for the sake of the Jews, he sufficiently\nshows this deliverance to be gratuitous. Finally, if Christ delivers us\nfrom guilt, the punishments consequent upon it must necessarily cease.\nXXXI. But as our adversaries also, on their part, arm themselves with\ntestimonies from the Scripture, let us examine what arguments they offer.\nThey reason in this way: David, after having been reproved by Nathan the\nprophet for adultery and murder, receives the pardon of his sin; and yet\nis afterwards punished by the death of the son that was the fruit of his\nadultery.(1757) We are taught to compensate by satisfactions for such\npunishments as would be inflicted even after the remission of the guilt.\nFor Daniel exhorted Nebuchadnezzar to atone for his sins by acts of\nmercy.(1758) And Solomon says, “By mercy and truth, iniquity is\npurged.”(1759) And that “charity shall cover a multitude of sins,”(1760)\nis a sentiment confirmed by the united testimony of Solomon and Peter. The\nLord also says in Luke, concerning the woman that had been a sinner, “Her\nsins are forgiven; for she loved much.”(1761) How perversely and\npreposterously they always estimate the Divine proceedings! But if they\nhad observed, what should by no means have been overlooked, that there are\ntwo kinds of Divine judgment, they would have seen, in this correction of\nDavid, a species of punishment very different from that which may be\nconsidered as vindictive. But since it highly concerns us all to\nunderstand the design of those chastisements with which God corrects our\nsins, and how greatly they differ from the examples of his indignation\npursuing the impious and reprobate, I conceive it will not be unseasonable\nto give a summary account of them. For the sake of perspicuity, let us\ncall one _vengeance_, or _vindictive judgment_, and the other\n_chastisement_, or _disciplinary judgment_. In vindictive judgment, God is\nto be contemplated as taking vengeance on his enemies, so as to exert his\nwrath against them, to confound, dissipate, and reduce them to nothing. We\nconsider it, therefore, strictly speaking, to be the vengeance of God,\nwhen the punishment he inflicts is attended with his indignation. In\ndisciplinary judgment, he is not so severe as to be angry; nor does he\npunish in order to destroy or precipitate into perdition. Wherefore, it is\nnot properly punishment or vengeance, but correction and admonition. The\nformer is the part of a judge, the latter of a father. For a judge, when\nhe punishes an offender, attends to the crime itself, and inflicts\npunishment according to the nature and aggravations of it. When a father\ncorrects his child with severity, he does it not to take vengeance or\nsatisfaction, but rather to teach him, and render him more cautious for\nthe future. Chrysostom somewhere uses a comparison a little different,\nwhich, nevertheless, comes to the same point. “A son (says he) is beaten;\na servant also is beaten; but the latter is punished as a slave, because\nhe has transgressed; the former is chastised as free and a son, that needs\nto be disciplined.” Correction serves to the latter for a probation and\nreformation, to the former for a scourge and a punishment.\nXXXII. To obtain a clear view of the whole subject in a small compass, it\nis necessary to state two distinctions respecting it. The first is, that\nwherever there is vindictive punishment, there also is a manifestation of\nthe curse and wrath of God, which he always withholds from believers.\nChastisement, on the contrary, is, as the Scripture teaches us, both a\nblessing of God, and a testimony of his love. This difference is\nsufficiently marked in every part of the Divine word. For all the\nafflictions which the impious endure in the present life, are represented\nto us as constituting a kind of antechamber of hell, whence they already\nhave a distant prospect of their eternal damnation; and they are so far\nfrom being reformed, or receiving any benefit from this, that they are\nrather prepared by such preludes for that most tremendous vengeance which\nfinally awaits them. On the contrary, the Lord repeatedly chastises his\nservants, yet does not deliver them over to death;(1762) wherefore they\nconfess that the strokes of his rod were highly beneficial and instructive\nto them. As we every where find that the saints bore these corrections\nwith resignation of soul, so they always earnestly deprecated punishments\nof the former kind. Jeremiah says, “O Lord, correct me, but with judgment;\nnot in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. Pour out thy fury upon\nthe heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not upon\nthy name.”(1763) And David: “O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither\nchasten me in thy hot displeasure.”(1764) Nor is it any objection to this,\nthat the Lord is frequently said to be angry with his saints, when he\nchastises them for their sins. As in Isaiah: “O Lord, I will praise thee;\nthough thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou\ncomfortedst me.”(1765) Habakkuk also: “In wrath remember mercy.”(1766) And\nMicah: “I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned\nagainst him.”(1767) Which reminds us, not only that those who are justly\npunished, receive no advantage from murmuring, but that the faithful\nderive a mitigation of their sorrow from a consideration of the intention\nof God. For on the same account he is said to profane his own inheritance,\nwhich, however, we know, he never will profane.(1768) That relates not to\nthe design or disposition of God in punishing, but to the vehement sense\nof sorrow experienced by those who suffer any of his severity. He not only\ndistresses his believing people with no small degree of rigour, but\nsometimes wounds them in such a manner, that they seem to themselves to be\non the brink of infernal destruction. Thus he declares, that they have\ndeserved his wrath; and this in order that they may be displeased with\nthemselves in their distresses, may be influenced by a greater concern to\nappease God, and may hasten with solicitude to implore his pardon; but in\nthis very procedure he exhibits a brighter testimony of his clemency than\nof his wrath. The covenant still remains which was made with us in our\ntrue Solomon, and the validity of which he, who cannot deceive, has\ndeclared shall never be diminished: “If his children forsake my law, and\nwalk not in my commandments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my\ncommandments; then will I visit their transgressions with the rod, and\ntheir iniquities with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving‐kindness will I not\nutterly take from him.”(1769) To assure us of this loving‐kindness, he\nsays, that the rod with which he will chastise the posterity of Solomon,\nand the stripes he will inflict on them, will be “the rod of men, and the\nstripes of the children of men.”(1770) While by these phrases he signifies\nmoderation and lenity, he also implies that those who feel his hand\nexerted against them cannot but be confounded with an extreme and deadly\nhorror. How much he observes this lenity in chastising his Israel, he\nshows by the prophet: “I have refined thee, (says he,) but not with\nsilver;(1771) for thou wouldst have been wholly consumed.” Though he\nteaches him that chastisements serve to purify him, yet he adds that he so\nfar moderates them, that they may not exceed what he is able to bear. And\nthis is highly necessary; for the more a man reveres God and devotes\nhimself to the cultivation of piety, he is so much the more tender to bear\nhis wrath. For though the reprobate groan under his scourges, yet because\nthey consider not the cause, but rather turn their backs both on their\nsins and on the Divine judgments, from this carelessness they contract an\ninsensibility; or because they murmur and resist, and rebel against their\njudge, that furious impetuosity stupefies them with madness and rage. But\nbelievers, admonished by the Divine corrections, immediately descend to\nthe consideration of their sins, and, stricken with fear and dread, resort\nto a suppliant deprecation of punishment. If God did not mitigate these\nsorrows, with which wretched souls torment themselves, they would be\ncontinually fainting, even under slight tokens of his wrath.\nXXXIII. The second distinction is, that when the reprobate are lashed by\nthe scourges of God in this world, they already begin to suffer his\nvindictive punishments; and though they will not escape with impunity for\nhaving disregarded such indications of the Divine wrath, yet they are not\npunished in order to their repentance, but only that, from their great\nmisery, they may prove God to be a judge who will inflict vengeance\naccording to their crimes. On the contrary, the children of God are\nchastised, not to make satisfaction to him for their sins, but that they\nmay thereby be benefited and brought to repentance. Wherefore we see, that\nsuch chastisements relate to the future rather than the past. To express\nthis, I would prefer Chrysostom’s language to my own. “For this reason\n(says he) God punishes us, not to take vengeance for our sins, but to\ncorrect us for the future.” Thus also Augustine: “That which you suffer,\nand which causes you to mourn, is a medicine to you, not a punishment; a\nchastisement, and not damnation. Reject not the scourge, if you desire not\nto be rejected from the inheritance. All this misery of mankind, under\nwhich the world groans, know, brethren, that it is a medicinal sorrow, not\na penal sentence.” These passages I have therefore thought proper to\nquote, that no one might consider the phraseology which I have adopted to\nbe novel or unusual. And to the same purpose are the indignant complaints\nin which the Lord frequently expostulates on account of the ingratitude of\nthe people, and their obstinate contempt of all their punishments. In\nIsaiah: “Why should ye be stricken any more? From the sole of the foot\neven unto the head there is no soundness.”(1772) But as the prophets\nabound in such passages, it will be sufficient briefly to have suggested,\nthat God punishes his Church with no other design than to subdue it to\nrepentance. Therefore, when he rejected Saul from the kingdom, he punished\nhim in a vindictive manner;(1773) when he deprived David of his infant\nson, he corrected him in order to his reformation.(1774) In this sense we\nmust understand the observation of Paul: “When we are judged, we are\nchastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the\nworld.”(1775) That is, when we, the children of God, are afflicted by the\nhand of our heavenly Father, this is not a punishment to confound us, but\nonly a chastisement to instruct us. In which Augustine evidently coincides\nwith us; for he teaches that the punishments with which men are equally\nchastised by God, are to be considered in different points of view;\nbecause to the saints, after the remission of their sins, they are\nconflicts and exercises, but to the reprobate, whose sins are not\nforgiven, they are the penalties due to their iniquity. He also mentions\nthe punishments inflicted on David and other pious persons, and says, that\nthose chastisements tended to promote their humility, and thereby to\nexercise and prove their piety. And the declaration of Isaiah, that\nJerusalem’s “iniquity is pardoned, for she hath received of the Lord’s\nhand double for all her sins,”(1776) proves not the pardon of\ntransgressions to depend on the suffering of the punishment, but is just\nas though he had said, “Punishments enough have now been inflicted on you;\nand as the severity and multitude of them have harassed you with a long\ncontinuance of grief and sorrow, it is time for you to receive the message\nof complete mercy, that your hearts may be expanded with joy, and\nexperience me to be your Father.” For God there assumes the character of a\nFather, who repents even of his righteous severity, when he has been\nconstrained to chastise his son with any degree of rigour.\nXXXIV. It is necessary that the faithful should be provided with these\nreflections in the anguish of afflictions. “The time is come that judgment\nmust begin at the house of God, upon which his name is called.”(1777) What\nwould the children of God do, if they believed the severity which they\nfeel to be the vengeance of God upon them? For he who, under the strokes\nof the Divine hand, considers God as an avenging Judge, cannot but\nconceive of Him as incensed against him, and hostile to him, and will\ntherefore detest his scourge itself as a curse and condemnation; in a\nword, he who thinks that God is still determined to punish him, can never\nbe persuaded to believe himself an object of the Divine love. The only one\nwho receives any benefit from the Divine chastisements, is he who\nconsiders God as angry with his crimes, but propitious and benevolent\ntowards his person. For otherwise the case must necessarily be similar to\nwhat the Psalmist complains of having experienced: “Thy fierce wrath goeth\nover me; thy terrors have cut me off.”(1778) And what Moses also speaks\nof: “For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.\nThou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of\nthy countenance. For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend\nour years as a tale that is told.”(1779) On the contrary, David, speaking\nof his paternal chastisements, in order to show that believers are rather\nassisted than oppressed by them, sings: “Blessed is the man whom thou\nchastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law; that thou mayest give\nhim rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the\nwicked.”(1780) It is certainly a severe temptation, when the Lord spares\nunbelievers, and conceals their crimes, while he appears more rigorous\ntowards his own children. For their consolation, therefore, he adds the\nadmonition of the law, whence they may learn, that it is for the promotion\nof their salvation when they are recalled into the way, but that the\nimpious are precipitated into their errors, which end in the pit. Nor is\nit of any importance whether the punishment be eternal or temporal. For\nwars, famines, plagues, and diseases are curses from God, as well as the\njudgment of eternal death itself, when they are inflicted as the\ninstruments of the Lord’s wrath and vengeance against the reprobate.\nXXXV. Every one, I presume, now perceives the design of the Lord’s\ncorrection of David, that it was to be a proof of God’s extreme\ndispleasure against murder and adultery, with which he declared himself to\nbe so greatly offended in his beloved and faithful servant, and to teach\nDavid never again to be guilty of such crimes; but not as a punishment, by\nwhich he was to render God a satisfaction for his offence. And we ought to\nform the same judgment concerning the other correction, in which the Lord\nafflicted the people with a violent pestilence, on account of the\ndisobedience of David in numbering them. For he freely forgave David the\nguilt of his sin; but because it was necessary, as a public example to all\nages, and also to the humiliation of David, that such an offence should\nnot remain unpunished, he chastised him with extreme severity. This end we\nshould keep in view also in the universal curse of mankind. For since we\nall, even after having obtained pardon, still suffer the miseries which\nwere inflicted on our first parent as the punishment of sin, we consider\nsuch afflictions as admonitions how grievously God is displeased with the\ntransgression of his law; that being thus dejected and humbled with a\nconsciousness of our miserable condition, we may aspire with greater\nardour after true blessedness. Now, he is very unwise, who imagines that\nthe calamities of the present life are inflicted upon us as satisfactions\nfor the guilt of sin. This appears to me to have been the meaning of\nChrysostom, when he said, “If God therefore inflicts punishments on us,\nthat while we are persisting in sins he may call us to repentance,—after a\ndiscovery of repentance, the punishment will be unnecessary.” Wherefore he\ntreats one person with greater severity, and another with more tender\nindulgence, as he knows to be suitable to every man’s particular\ndisposition. Therefore, when he means to suggest that he is not\nexcessively severe in the infliction of punishment, he reproaches an\nobdurate and obstinate people, that though they have been corrected, they\nhave not forsaken their sins.(1781) In this sense he complains, that\n“Ephraim is a cake not turned,”(1782) that is, scorched on one side,\nunbaked on the other; because his corrections did not penetrate the hearts\nof the people, so as to expel their vices and render them proper objects\nof pardon. By expressing himself in this manner, he certainly gives us to\nunderstand, that as soon as they shall have repented, he will be\nimmediately appeased, and that the rigour which he exercises in chastising\noffences is extorted from him by our obstinacy, but would be prevented by\na voluntary reformation. Yet since our obduracy and ignorance are such as\nuniversally to need castigation, our most wise Father is pleased to\nexercise all his children, without exception, with the strokes of his rod,\nas long as they live. It is astonishing why they fix their eyes thus on\nthe example of David alone, and are unaffected by so many instances in\nwhich they might behold a gratuitous remission of sins. The publican is\nsaid to have gone down from the temple justified;(1783) no punishment\nfollows. Peter obtained the pardon of his sins. “We read,” says Ambrose,\n“of his tears, but not of his satisfaction.”(1784) And a paralytic hears\nthe following address: “Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven\nthee;”(1785) no punishment is inflicted. All the absolutions which are\nmentioned in the Scripture, are described as gratuitous. A general rule\nought rather to be deduced from these numerous examples, than from that\nsingle case which is attended with peculiar circumstances.\nXXXVI. When Daniel exhorted Nebuchadnezzar to “break off his sins by\nrighteousness, and his iniquities by showing mercy to the poor,”(1786) he\nmeant not to intimate that righteousness and mercy propitiate God and\natone for sins; for God forbid that there should ever be any other\nredemption than the blood of Christ. But he used the term _break off_ with\nreference to men, rather than to God; as though he had said, “Thou hast\nexercised, O king, an unrighteous and violent despotism; thou hast\noppressed the weak; thou hast plundered the poor; thou hast treated thy\npeople with harshness and iniquity; instead of unjust exactions, instead\nof violence and oppression, now substitute mercy and righteousness.” In a\nsimilar sense Solomon says, that “love covereth all sins;” not with\nreference to God, but among men. For the whole verse is as follows:\n“Hatred stirreth up strifes; but love covereth all sins.”(1787) In which\nverse, he, according to his usual custom, contrasts the evils arising from\nhatred with the fruits of love; signifying, that they who hate each other,\nreciprocally harass, criminate, reproach, revile, and convert every thing\ninto a fault; but that they who love one another, mutually conceal,\nconnive at, and reciprocally forgive, many things among themselves; not\nthat they approve each other’s faults, but bear with them, and heal them\nby admonition, rather than aggravate them by invectives. Nor can we doubt\nthat Peter intended the same in his citation of this passage,(1788) unless\nwe mean to accuse him of corrupting, and craftily perverting the\nScriptures. When Solomon says, that “by mercy and truth iniquity is\npurged,”(1789) he intends not a compensation in the Divine view, so that\nGod, being appeased with such a satisfaction, remits the punishment which\nhe would otherwise have inflicted; but, in the familiar manner of\nScripture, he signifies, that they shall find him propitious to them who\nhave forsaken their former vices and iniquities, and are converted to him\nin piety and truth; as though he had said, that the wrath of God subsides,\nand his judgment ceases, when we cease from our sins. He describes not the\ncause of pardon, but the mode of true conversion. Just as the prophets\nfrequently declare that it is in vain for hypocrites to offer to God\nostentatious ceremonies instead of repentance, since he is only pleased\nwith integrity and the duties of charity; and as the author of the Epistle\nto the Hebrews, when he recommends us “to do good and to communicate,”\ninforms us that “with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”(1790) And when\nChrist ridicules the Pharisees for having attended only to the cleansing\nof dishes, and neglected all purity of heart, and commands them to give\nalms that all might be clean,(1791) he is not exhorting them to make a\nsatisfaction, but only teaching them what kind of purity obtains the\nDivine approbation. But of this expression we have treated in another\nwork.(1792)\nXXXVII. With respect to the passage of Luke,(1793) no one, who has read\nwith a sound judgment the parable the Lord there proposes, will enter into\nany controversy with us concerning it. The Pharisee thought within\nhimself, that the Lord did not know the woman, whom he had so easily\nadmitted to his presence. For he imagined that Christ would not have\nadmitted her, if he had known what kind of a sinner she was. And thence he\ninferred that Christ, who was capable of being so deceived, was not a\nprophet. To show that she was not a sinner, her sins having already been\nforgiven, the Lord proposed this parable: “There was a certain creditor,\nwhich had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other\nfifty. He frankly forgave them both. Which of them will love him most?”\nThe Pharisee answered, “He to whom he forgave most.” The Lord rejoins,\nHence know that “this woman’s sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she\nloved much.” In these words, you see, he makes her love, not the cause of\nthe remission of her sins, but the proof of it. For they are taken from a\ncomparison of that debtor to whom five hundred pence had been forgiven, of\nwhom it is said, not that his debt was forgiven, because he had loved\nmuch, but that he loved much because his debt had been forgiven. And this\nsimilitude may be applied to the case of the woman in the following\nmanner: “You suppose this woman to be a sinner; but you ought to know that\nshe is not such, since her sins are forgiven her. And her love ought to\nconvince you of the remission of her sins, by the grateful return she\nmakes for this blessing.” It is an argumentum _a posteriori_, by which any\nthing is proved from its consequences. By what means she obtained\nremission of sins, the Lord plainly declares: “Thy faith,” says he, “hath\nsaved thee.” By faith therefore we obtain remission, by love we give\nthanks and declare the goodness of the Lord.\nXXXVIII. To those things which frequently occur in the works of the\nfathers concerning _satisfaction_, I pay little regard. I see, indeed,\nthat some of them, or, to speak plainly, almost all whose writings are\nextant, have either erred on this point, or expressed themselves too\nharshly. But I shall not admit that they were so ignorant and\ninexperienced, as to write those things in the sense in which they are\nunderstood by the modern advocates for satisfaction. Chrysostom somewhere\nexpresses himself thus: “Where mercy is requested, examination ceases;\nwhere mercy is implored, judgment is not severe; where mercy is sought,\nthere is no room for punishment; where there is mercy, there is no\ninquiry; where mercy is, an answer is freely given.” These expressions,\nhowever they may be distorted, can never be reconciled with the dogmas of\nthe schools. In the treatise On Ecclesiastical Doctrines, which is\nascribed to Augustine, we read the following passage: “The satisfaction of\nrepentance is to cut off the causes of sins, and not to indulge an\nentrance to their suggestions.” Whence it appears, that even in those\ntimes the doctrine of satisfaction, as a compensation for sins committed,\nwas universally rejected, since he refers all satisfaction to a cautious\nabstinence from sins in future. I will not quote what is further asserted\nby Chrysostom, that the Lord requires of us nothing more than to confess\nour sins before him with tears; for passages of this kind frequently occur\nin his writings, and in those of other fathers. Augustine somewhere calls\nworks of mercy “remedies for obtaining remission of sins;” but lest any\none should stumble at that expression, he explains himself more fully in\nanother place. “The flesh of Christ,” says he, “is the true and sole\nsacrifice for sins, not only for those which are all obliterated in\nbaptism, but also for those which afterwards creep in through infirmity;\non account of which the whole Church at present exclaims, Forgive us our\ndebts;(1794) and they are forgiven through that single sacrifice.”\nXXXIX. But they most commonly used the word “satisfaction” to signify, not\na compensation rendered to God, but a public testification, by which those\nwho had been punished with excommunication, when they wished to be\nreadmitted to communion, gave the Church an assurance of their repentance.\nFor there were enjoined on those penitents certain fastings, and other\nobservances, by which they might prove themselves truly and cordially\nweary of their former life, or rather obliterate the memory of their past\nactions; and thus they were said to make satisfaction, not to God, but to\nthe Church. This is also expressed by Augustine in these very words, in\nhis Enchiridion ad Laurentium. From that ancient custom have originated\nthe confessions and satisfactions which are used in the present age; a\nviperous brood which retain not even the shadow of that original form. I\nknow that the fathers sometimes express themselves rather harshly; nor do\nI deny, what I have just asserted, that perhaps they have erred. But their\nwritings, which were only besprinkled with a few spots, after they have\nbeen handled by such foul hands, became thoroughly soiled. And if we must\ncontend with the authority of fathers, what fathers do they obtrude upon\nus? Most of those passages, of which Lombard, their champion, has compiled\nhis heterogeneous collection, are extracted from the insipid reveries of\nsome monks, which are circulated under the names of Ambrose, Jerome,\nAugustine, and Chrysostom. Thus, on the present argument, he borrows\nalmost every thing from a Treatise on Repentance, which is a ridiculous\nselection from various authors, good and bad; it bears the name of\nAugustine indeed, but no man even of moderate learning can deign to admit\nit as really his. For not entering into a more particular examination of\ntheir absurdities, I request the pardon of the reader, whom I wish to\nspare that trouble. It would be both easy and plausible for me to expose\nto the greatest contempt, what they have heretofore celebrated as\nmysteries; but I forbear, as my object is to write what may tend to\nedification."

          "title": "Chapter V. Indulgences And Purgatory. The Supplements To Their Doctrine Of",
          "content": "Satisfactions.\nThis doctrine of _satisfaction_ has given rise to _indulgences_. For by\nindulgences they pretend, that the deficiency of our abilities to make\nsatisfaction is supplied, and even proceed to the extravagance of defining\nthem to be the dispensation of the merits of Christ and of the martyrs,\nwhich the Pope distributes in his bulls. Now, though such persons are\nfitter subjects for a mad‐house than for arguments, so that it would be of\nlittle use to engage in refuting errors so frivolous, which have been\nshaken by many attacks, and begin of themselves to grow obsolete, and\ntotter towards a fall, yet, as a brief refutation will be useful to some\nminds hitherto uninformed on the subject, I shall not altogether omit it.\nAnd indeed the establishment and long continuance of indulgences, with the\nunlimited influence retained by them amidst such outrageous and furious\nlicentiousness, may serve to convince us in what a deep night of errors\nmen were immersed for several ages. They saw, that they were themselves\nobjects of the public and undissembled ridicule of the Pope and the\ndispensers of his bulls; that lucrative bargains were made concerning the\nsalvation of their souls; that the price of salvation was fixed at a\ntrifling sum of money, and nothing presented gratuitously; that under this\npretext, contributions were extorted from them, which were vilely consumed\non brothels, pimps, and revellings; that the greatest advocates of\nindulgences were the greatest despisers of them; that this monster was\ndaily making longer strides in licentious power and luxury, and that there\nwas no end, that more trash was continually produced, and more money\ncontinually extorted. Yet they received indulgences with the greatest\nveneration, adored them and purchased them; and those who had more\ndiscernment than others, yet considered them as pious frauds, by which\nthey might be deceived with some advantage. At length, since the world has\npermitted itself to recover a little the exercise of reason, indulgences\nbecome more and more discredited, till they altogether disappear.\nII. But since many, who see the pollution, imposture, robbery, and\nrapacity, with which the dispensers of indulgences have hitherto amused\nthemselves and cajoled us, do not perceive the fountain of all this\nimpiety,—it will be necessary to show, not only the nature of indulgences\nas commonly used, but what they are in themselves when abstracted from\nevery adventitious blemish. The merits of Christ and of the holy apostles\nand martyrs, they style “the treasury of the Church.” The principal\ncustody of this repository they pretend to have been delivered, as I have\nalready hinted, to the bishop of Rome, who has the dispensation of such\ngreat benefits, so that he can both bestow them himself, and delegate the\npower of bestowing them to others. Hence from the Pope are received\nsometimes plenary indulgences, sometimes indulgences for a certain number\nof years; from Cardinals, for a hundred days; from Bishops, for forty\ndays. But to describe them correctly, they are a profanation of the blood\nof Christ and a delusion of Satan, by which they seduce Christians from\nthe grace of God and the life which is in Christ, and turn them aside from\nthe right way of salvation. For how could the blood of Christ be more\nbasely profaned, than when it is denied to be sufficient for the remission\nof sins, for reconciliation and satisfaction, unless its deficiency be\nsupplied from some other quarter? “To him,” says Peter, “give all the\nprophets witness, that through his name, whosoever believeth on him shall\nreceive remission of sins.”(1795) Indulgences dispense remission of sins\nthrough Peter, and Paul, and the martyrs. “The blood of Jesus Christ,”\nsays John, “cleanseth us from all sin.”(1796) Indulgences make the blood\nof the martyrs the ablution of sins. Paul says, that Christ, “who knew no\nsin, was made sin for us;” that is, a satisfaction for sin, “that we might\nbe made the righteousness of God in him.”(1797) Indulgences place\nsatisfaction for sins in the blood of the martyrs. Paul declared to the\nCorinthians, that Christ alone was crucified and died for them.(1798)\nIndulgences pronounce that Paul and others died for us. In another place\nhe says, that Christ “hath purchased the Church with his own blood.”(1799)\nIndulgences assign another price of this purchase, in the blood of the\nmartyrs. The apostle says, that “by one offering Christ hath perfected for\never them that are sanctified.”(1800) Indulgences, on the contrary,\nproclaim that sanctification, which were otherwise insufficient, receives\nits perfection from the martyrs. John declares that all saints “have\nwashed their robes in the blood of the Lamb.”(1801) Indulgences teach us\nto wash our robes in the blood of the saints.\nIII. Leo, bishop of Rome, excellently opposes these sacrilegious\npretensions in his epistle to the Bishops of Palestine. “Although the\ndeath of many saints,” he says, “has been precious in the sight of the\nLord, yet the murder of no innocent person has been the propitiation of\nthe world. The righteous have received, not bestowed, crowns; and from the\nfortitude of the faithful have arisen examples of patience, not gifts of\nrighteousness. For their deaths have been all singular, nor has any one by\nhis death discharged the debt of another; for it is the Lord Christ alone,\nin whom all are crucified, dead, buried, and raised from the dead.” This\npassage being worthy of remembrance, he repeats it in another place.\nSurely nothing clearer can be desired, in confutation of this impious\ndoctrine of indulgences. And Augustine expresses himself with equal\npropriety to the same purpose. He says, “Although we die, brethren for\nbrethren, yet the blood of no martyr is ever shed for the remission of\nsins. Christ has done this for us; and in doing it has not given an\nexample in which we should imitate him, but conferred a favour for which\nwe should thank him.” Again, in another place: “As the Son of God alone\nbecame the Son of man, to make us with himself sons of God, so he alone,\nwithout any demerits, sustained the punishment for us, that we, without\nany merits, might through him obtain undeserved grace.” Indeed, whilst\ntheir whole doctrine is a compound of horrible sacrilege and blasphemies,\nyet this is a blasphemy more monstrous than the rest. Let them acknowledge\nwhether these be not their opinions, that the martyrs have by their death\nperformed for God, and merited from him, more than was necessary for\nthemselves; that they had so great a redundance of merits, as to\nsuperabound to others; that therefore, lest so great a blessing should be\nsuperfluous, their blood is commingled with the blood of Christ, and that\nof both these is formed the treasury of the Church for the remission and\nexpiation of sins; and that in this sense we ought to understand the\ndeclaration of Paul, “I fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of\nChrist in my flesh, for his body’s sake, which is the Church.”(1802) What\nis this but leaving Christ a mere name, and in other respects making him\nan inferior saint of the common order, scarcely distinguishable among the\nmultitude? He alone ought to have been preached, he alone exhibited, he\nalone mentioned, he alone regarded, in all discourses on the procurement\nof remission of sins, expiation, and sanctification. But let us hear their\ngrand argument: That the blood of the martyrs may not be shed in vain, let\nit be applied to the common benefit of the Church. Indeed? Was it no\nadvantage to glorify God by their death? to subscribe to his truth with\ntheir blood? to testify by their contempt of the present life, that they\nsought a better one? by their constancy, to confirm the faith of the\nChurch, and vanquish the obstinacy of their enemies? But this is the fact:\nthey acknowledge no benefit, if Christ alone be the propitiator, if he\nalone died for our sins, if he alone was offered for our redemption. Peter\nand Paul, they say, might nevertheless have obtained the crown of victory,\nif they had expired in their beds. But since they contended even to blood,\nit would be incompatible with the justice of God to leave this _barren_ or\n_unfruitful_. As if God knew not how to augment the glory of his servants\naccording to the extent of his gifts. But the Church in general receives\nan advantage sufficiently great, when by their triumphs it is inflamed\nwith the same zeal for similar exertions and conflicts.\nIV. But how maliciously they pervert that passage of Paul, where he says,\n“that he fills up in his own flesh that which is behind of the afflictions\nof Christ!”(1803) For he refers that deficiency and supplement, not to the\nwork of redemption, satisfaction, or expiation, but to those afflictions,\nwith which the members of Christ, even all the faithful, must necessarily\nbe exercised as long as they live in the present state. He says,\ntherefore, that this remains of the afflictions of Christ, that having\nonce suffered in himself, he daily suffers in his members. Christ honors\nus so far as to consider our afflictions as his. When Paul adds that he\nsuffered “for the Church,” he means not for the redemption,\nreconciliation, or atonement of the Church, but for its edification and\nprofit. As in another place he says, “I endure all things for the elect’s\nsakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ\nJesus.”(1804) He writes to the Corinthians, that whatever tribulations he\nendured, he was “afflicted for their consolation and salvation.”(1805) And\nhe immediately proceeds to explain himself, by adding, that he was made a\nminister of the Church, not for its redemption, but according to the\ndispensation which had been committed to him, to preach the gospel of\nChrist.(1806) But if they require also another expositor, let them attend\nto Augustine: “The sufferings of Christ,” says he, “are in Christ alone,\nas in the head; in Christ and the Church, as in the whole body. Whence\nPaul, one of the members, says, I fill up in my flesh that which is behind\nof the afflictions of Christ. If you, therefore, whoever you are that read\nthis, are one of the members of Christ, all that you suffer from such as\nare not members of Christ, was behind in the afflictions of Christ.” But\nthe tendency of the sufferings of the apostles, sustained on account of\nthe Church, is stated by him in another place: “Christ is my door to you;\nbecause you are the sheep of Christ, purchased with his blood: acknowledge\nyour price, which is not given by me, but preached by me.” Then he adds,\n“As he has laid down his life, so we ought also to lay down our lives for\nthe brethren, for the establishment of peace and the confirmation of\nfaith.” This is the language of Augustine. But let it not be imagined,\nthat Paul thought there was any deficiency in the sufferings of Christ,\nwith respect to all the plenitude of righteousness, salvation, and life;\nor that any addition to them was intended by him, who so clearly and\nmagnificently proclaims, that the “abundance of grace by Christ” was\npoured forth with such liberality, that it “much more abounded” beyond all\nthe aboundings of sin.(1807) It is not by the merit of their own life or\ndeath, but by this grace alone, that all the saints have been saved, as\nPeter expressly testifies;(1808) so that he would be guilty of an\ninjurious contempt of God and of his Christ, who should place the\nworthiness of any saint in any thing else but the mere mercy of God. But\nwhy do I dwell any longer on this subject, as though it were still\ninvolved in obscurity? whereas the statement of such monstrous notions is\nof itself a complete refutation of them.\nV. Now, to pass from such abominations, who taught the Pope to enclose in\nlead and parchment the grace of Jesus Christ, which the Lord designed to\nbe dispensed by the word of the gospel? Either the gospel of God must be\nfalse, or their indulgences fallacious. For that Christ is offered to us\nin the gospel, with all his plenitude of heavenly blessings, with all his\nmerits, with all his righteousness, wisdom, and grace, without any\nexception, is testified by Paul, when he says, “God hath committed unto us\nthe word of reconciliation. Now, then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as\nthough God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye\nreconciled to God. For he hath made him, who knew no sin, to be sin for\nus; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1809) And\nbelievers know the meaning of that “fellowship of Christ,”(1810) which,\naccording to the testimony of the same apostle, is offered to our\nenjoyment in the gospel. Indulgences, on the contrary, produce a certain\nallowance of grace from the Pope’s repository, fix it to lead and\nparchment, and even to a particular place, and separate it from the word\nof God. Now, if any one inquire the origin of this abuse, it seems to have\narisen from an ancient custom, that when more severe satisfactions were\nimposed on penitents than could possibly be borne by all, they who felt\nthemselves oppressed beyond measure, petitioned the Church for some\nrelaxation of rigour. The remission granted to such persons was called\nindulgence. But when they transferred satisfactions to God, and said that\nthey were compensations, by which men might redeem themselves from the\njudgment of God, they also converted these indulgences into expiatory\nremedies, to deliver us from deserved punishments. But the blasphemies\nwhich we have mentioned have been fabricated with such consummate\nimpudence, that they have not even the least appearance of plausibility.\nVI. Nor let them now trouble us any more about their purgatory, since it\nis utterly demolished by this argument. For I cannot coincide with some,\nwho think it best to be silent on this point, and to omit the mention of\npurgatory, from which, they say, many sharp contentions arise, but very\nlittle edification results. Indeed, I should myself be of opinion that\nsuch trifles are unworthy of notice, if they did not consider them as\nmatters of importance. But since purgatory has been erected with a\nmultitude of blasphemies, and is daily propped by new ones, and since it\nexcites many and grievous offences, it really must not pass without\nnotice. It might be possible for a time to conceal that it was a fiction\nof curious and presumptuous temerity, unsupported by the word of God; that\nit was accredited by I know not what revelation invented by the subtlety\nof Satan; that for its confirmation some passages of Scripture were\nabsurdly perverted. The Lord, however, suffers not human presumption thus\nviolently to break into the hidden recesses of his judgment;(1811) and has\nseverely prohibited the neglect of his word and the inquiry after truth\namong the dead; and does not permit his word to be thus irreverently\ndishonoured. Nevertheless, admitting that all these things might for a\nshort time have been tolerated as matters of small importance, yet when\nexpiation of sins is sought any where but in the blood of Christ, when\nsatisfaction is transferred to any other, silence becomes dangerous in the\nextreme. Therefore we should exclaim with all our might, that purgatory is\na pernicious fiction of Satan, that it makes void the cross of Christ,\nthat it intolerably insults the Divine mercy, and weakens and overturns\nour faith. For what is their purgatory, but a satisfaction for sins paid\nafter death by the souls of the deceased? Thus the notion of satisfaction\nbeing overthrown, purgatory itself is immediately subverted from its very\nfoundations. But if it has been fully evinced, that the blood of Christ is\nthe only satisfaction, expiation, and purgation for the sins of the\nfaithful, what is the necessary inference, but that purgatory is nothing\nbut a horrible blasphemy against Christ? I pass by the sacrilegious\npretences with which it is daily defended, the offences which it produces\nin religion, and the other innumerable evils which we perceive to have\nproceeded from such a source of impiety.\nVII. It is worth while, however, to wrest out of their hands those\npassages of Scripture, which they have falsely and corruptly pressed into\ntheir service. The assertion of the Lord, that the sin against the Holy\nGhost “shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world\nto come,”(1812) implies, they say, that there is a forgiveness of some\nsins in the world to come. But who does not see, that the Lord there\nspeaks of the guilt of sin? And if this be the case, what has it to do\nwith their purgatory, for there they suppose punishment to be inflicted\nfor sins, the guilt of which they do not deny to have been forgiven in the\npresent life? But to prevent all further cavils, they shall have a plainer\nanswer. When the Lord intended to cut off from such flagitious iniquity\nall hope of pardon, he thought it not sufficient to say that it should\nnever be forgiven; but for the sake of further amplification he adopted a\ndistinction, comprehending both the judgment which the conscience of every\nindividual feels in this life, and that final judgment which will be\npublicly held at the resurrection; as though he had said, “Beware of\nmalicious rebellion, as of immediate perdition; for he who shall have\npurposely endeavoured to extinguish the offered light of the Spirit, shall\nnever obtain pardon, neither in this life, which is allotted to sinners\nfor their conversion, nor in the last day, when the lambs shall be\nseparated from the goats by the angels of God, and the kingdom of heaven\nshall be purged from every offence.” They next adduce this parable from\nMatthew: “Agree with thine adversary; lest at any time the adversary\ndeliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and\nthou be cast into prison. Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till\nthou hast paid the uttermost farthing.”(1813) If in this place the judge\nsignify God, the adversary the devil, the officer an angel, the prison\npurgatory, I will readily submit to them. But if it be evident to every\none, that Christ there intended to show to how many dangers and calamities\npersons exposed themselves, who prefer obstinately exerting the rigour of\nthe law, to acting upon the principles of equity and kindness, in order\nthe more earnestly to exhort his disciples to an equitable concord, pray\nwhere will purgatory be found?\nVIII. They derive an argument from the language of Paul, where he has\naffirmed, “that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in\nheaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.”(1814) For they\nassume it as granted, that “things (or persons) under the earth” cannot be\nunderstood of those who are consigned to eternal damnation. It follows,\ntherefore, that they must be the souls suffering in purgatory. Their\nreasoning would not be very bad, if, by genuflection, the apostle designed\ntruly pious worship; but since he simply teaches, that dominion is\ncommitted to Christ, by which all creatures must be subjugated, why may we\nnot understand this phrase of the devils, who will indeed stand at the\ntribunal of the Lord, and acknowledge him as their Judge with fear and\ntrembling? As Paul himself elsewhere explains the same prophecy: “We shall\nall stand,” says he, “before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is\nwritten, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,” &c.(1815)\nBut they reply, we cannot give the same kind of interpretation to this\npassage in the Revelation: “Every creature which is in heaven, and on the\nearth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are\nin them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be\nunto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and\never.”(1816) This I readily concede; but what creatures do they suppose to\nbe here enumerated? for it is very certain, that the expressions\ncomprehend creatures both irrational and inanimate. It is a mere\ndeclaration that all the parts of the world, from the summit of the\nheavens to the centre of the earth, celebrate, in their respective ways,\nthe glory of the Creator. What they produce from the history of the\nMaccabees, I shall not honour with an answer, that I may not be supposed\nto place that work in the catalogue of sacred books. But Augustine, they\nsay, received it as canonical. I inquire, first, With what degree of\ncredit did he receive it? He says, “The history of the Maccabees is not\nesteemed by the Jews as the law, and the prophets, and the Psalms, to\nwhich the Lord gives a testimony, as being witnesses concerning him,\nsaying, ‘All things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of\nMoses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.’(1817) But\nit has been received by the Church, and not altogether unprofitably, if it\nbe read or heard with sobriety,” &c. Jerome, without any scruple,\ninculcates, that its authority is of no force in the support of doctrines.\nAnd from that old treatise on the Exposition of the Creed, which is\nascribed to Cyprian, it clearly appears that it was not admitted in the\nancient Church. But why am I now contending to no purpose? as though the\nauthor himself did not sufficiently show what deference is due to him,\nwhen, at the conclusion, he begs pardon if he should have spoken any thing\nimproperly. Certainly he who confesses that his writings need pardon,\nproclaims them not to be the oracles of the Holy Spirit. Besides, the\npiety of Judas Maccabeus is commended on no other ground, but because he\nhad a firm hope of the final resurrection, when he sent to Jerusalem an\noblation for the dead. Nor does the historian represent this oblation as\nintended to be a price of redemption, but that those in whose names it was\noffered might be partakers of eternal life with the rest of the faithful\nwho had died in defence of their country and religion. This action was\naccompanied, indeed, by superstition and preposterous zeal; but they are\nmore than infatuated who apply to us a sacrifice offered under the law;\nsince we know, that all such ancient usages ceased at the advent of\nChrist.\nIX. But they find in Paul an invincible argument, which cannot be so\neasily answered. “If any man,” says he, “build upon this foundation gold,\nsilver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man’s work shall be\nmade manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed\nby fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is. If\nany man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall\nbe saved; yet so as by fire.”(1818) What can this be, they ask, but\npurgatorial fire, by which the pollution of sins is cleansed, that we may\nenter pure into the kingdom of God? But most of the fathers were of a\ndifferent opinion, understanding the word “fire” to mean tribulation, or\nthe cross, by which the Lord tries his children, to purify them from all\ncarnal pollution; and this is much more probable than the notion of\npurgatory. I cannot, however, coincide with them; for I think I have\ndiscovered a far more certain and lucid interpretation of this passage.\nBut before I state it, I could wish them to answer this question—whether\nthey suppose it was necessary for the apostles and all the saints to pass\nthrough this purgatorial fire. I know they will answer in the negative;\nfor it were too absurd, that purification should be necessary to those\nwhose redundant merits they vainly imagine to superabound to all the\nmembers of the Church. But the apostle affirms this; for he says, not that\nthe work of some, but that the work of all, shall be proved. Nor is this\nmy own argument, but Augustine’s, who thus opposes the interpretation now\nadopted by our adversaries. And, what would be still more absurd, he says,\nnot that they shall pass through the fire on account of any works, but\nthat if they have edified the Church with perfect fidelity, they shall\nreceive a reward, when their work shall have been tried by fire. In the\nfirst place, we see that the apostle uses a metaphor, when he calls\ndoctrines of human invention “wood, hay, stubble.” The reason of the\nmetaphor also is evident; that as wood, immediately on being placed in\ncontact with fire, consumes and wastes away, so neither will those\ndoctrines be able to abide the test of examination. Now, it is well known\nthat such an examination proceeds from the Spirit of God. Therefore, to\npursue the thread of the metaphor, and to adapt the parts by a proper\nrelation to each other, he gives the Holy Spirit’s examination the\nappellation of _fire_. For as gold and silver afford a more certain proof\nof their goodness and purity in proportion to their proximity to the fire,\nso Divine truth receives the stronger confirmation of its authority, in\nproportion to the strictness of spiritual examination by which it is\ninvestigated. As wood, hay, and stubble, brought into contact with fire,\nare speedily consumed, so the inventions of men, unsupported by the word\nof God, cannot bear the examination of the Holy Spirit, but must\nimmediately fall to the ground. Finally, if false doctrines are compared\nto wood, hay, and stubble, because, like wood, hay, and stubble, they are\nconsumed by fire and entirely destroyed, and if they are overcome only by\nthe Spirit of the Lord, it follows that the Spirit is that fire by which\nthey will be proved. This trial Paul calls _the day_, or _the day of the\nLord_, according to the common phraseology of Scripture. For that is\ncalled the day of the Lord, whenever he manifests his presence to men.\nNow, we enjoy most of the light of his countenance when we are favoured\nwith the radiance of his truth. It has been evinced that Paul means no\nother fire than the examination of the Holy Spirit. But how are they saved\nby the fire, who suffer the loss of their work? This it will not be\ndifficult to comprehend, if we consider of what class of men he is\nspeaking. For he characterizes them as builders of the Church, who retain\ntheir legitimate foundation, but raise the superstructure of unequal\nmaterials: they are such as do not deviate from the principal and\nessential articles of the faith, but err in inferior and less important\nones, mixing their own inventions with the word of God. Such, I say, must\nsuffer the loss of their work, by their inventions being destroyed; but\nthey are themselves saved, yet so as by fire; that is, not because their\nignorance and error can be approved by the Lord, but because they are\npurified from them by the grace and power of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore,\nwhoever have corrupted the pure gold of the Divine word with this filth of\npurgatory, must necessarily suffer the loss of their work.\nX. Our opponents will reply, that it has been a very ancient opinion in\nthe Church. Paul removes this objection when he comprehends even his own\nage in this sentence, where he denounces, that all must suffer the loss of\ntheir work, who, in the structure of the Church, should place any thing\nnot corresponding to the foundation. When our adversaries, therefore,\nobject to me, that to offer prayers for the dead has been the practice of\nmore than thirteen hundred years, I inquire of them, on the contrary, by\nwhat word of God, by what revelation, by what example, it is sanctioned.\nFor they are not only destitute of any testimonies of Scripture in favour\nof it, but none of the examples of the saints there recorded exhibit any\nthing like it. Respecting mourning and funeral offices, it contains many\nand sometimes long accounts; but of prayers for persons deceased, you\ncannot discover the smallest hint. But the greater the importance of the\nsubject, so much the rather ought it to have been particularly mentioned.\nEven the fathers themselves, who offered up prayers for the dead, saw that\nthey had neither a Divine command, nor a legitimate example, to justify\nthe practice. Why, then, did they presume to adopt it? In this, I say,\nthey discovered themselves to be but men; and therefore I contend, that\nwhat they did ought not to be enforced for the imitation of others. For\nsince believers ought not to undertake any thing without an assurance of\nconscience, according to the direction of Paul,(1819) this assurance is\nchiefly requisite in prayer. Yet it will be urged, It is probable that\nthey were impelled to it by some reason. I reply, Perhaps they sought some\nconsolation to alleviate their sorrow, and it might appear inhuman not to\ngive some testimony of their love towards the dead in the presence of God.\nThe propensity of the human mind to this affection, all men know by\nexperience. The custom, also, when received, was like a flame, kindling\nardour in the minds of multitudes. We know that funeral rites have been\nperformed to the dead among all nations, and in every age, and that\nlustrations have been annually made for their departed spirits. For though\nSatan has deluded foolish mortals with these fallacies, yet he has\nborrowed the occasion of the deception from a true principle—that death is\nnot an annihilation, but a transition from this life into another. Nor can\nit be doubted, but that even superstition itself convicts the heathen\nbefore the tribunal of God, for neglecting all the concerns of a future\nlife, which they professed to believe. Now, Christians, because they would\nnot be inferior to the heathen, were ashamed to perform no services for\nthe dead, as though they had wholly ceased to exist. Hence that\ninconsiderate officiousness; because if they were negligent in attending\nto funerals, feasts, and oblations, they were afraid they should expose\nthemselves to great disgrace. What first proceeded from a perverse\nemulation, has been so repeatedly augmented by novel additions, that the\nprincipal sanctity of Popery consists in relieving the distresses of the\ndead. But the Scripture administers another consolation, far better and\nmore substantial, when it declares that “Blessed are the dead which die in\nthe Lord;” and adds as a reason, “that they may rest from their\nlabours.”(1820) But we ought not to indulge our own affection so far as to\nintroduce a corrupt method of praying into the Church. Certainly, he that\nhas but a moderate share of penetration, will easily discover all that we\nfind on this subject in the fathers to have been in compliance with\ngeneral practice and vulgar ignorance. I confess, they were also involved\nin the error themselves, from an inconsiderate credulity which frequently\ndeprives the human mind of its judgment. But in the mean time, the mere\nreading of them demonstrates with what hesitation they recommend prayers\nfor the dead. Augustine, in his Book of Confessions, relates that Monica,\nhis mother, had vehemently entreated to be remembered in the celebration\nof the mysteries at the altar. This was the wish of an old woman, which\nher son did not examine by the standard of Scripture; but from his natural\naffection for her, wished it to gain the approbation of others. But the\ntreatise composed by him, on Care for the Dead, contains so many\nhesitations, that it ought by its coolness to extinguish the heat of\nimprudent zeal. If any one desires to be an intercessor for the dead, this\ntreatise, with its frigid probabilities, will certainly remove all the\nsolicitude he may have previously experienced. For this is its only\nsupport, that since it has been customary to pray for the dead, it is a\nduty not to be despised. But though I concede, that the ancient writers of\nthe Church esteemed it a pious act to pray for the dead, yet we must\nalways remember a rule which can never deceive—that it is not right for us\nin our prayers to introduce any thing of our own, but that our desires\nmust be submitted to the word of God; because he chooses to prescribe what\nhe designs we should ask. Now, since there is not a syllable, in all the\nlaw or the gospel, which allows us to pray for the dead, it is a profane\nabuse of the name of God, to attempt more than he enjoins. But that our\nadversaries may not glory, as though the ancient Church were associated\nwith them in their error, I assert that there is a considerable difference\nbetween them. The ancients preserved the memory of the dead, that they\nmight not seem to have cast off all concern for them; but they at the same\ntime confessed their uncertainty concerning their state. Respecting\npurgatory they asserted nothing, but considered it as quite uncertain. The\nmoderns expect their reveries concerning purgatory to be admitted as\nunquestionable articles of faith. The fathers, in the communion of the\nsacred supper, merely recommended their deceased friends to the mercy of\nGod. The Papists are incessantly urging a concern for the dead; and by\ntheir importunate declamations cause it to be preferred to all the duties\nof charity. Besides, it would not be difficult for us to produce some\ntestimonies from the fathers which manifestly overthrow all those prayers\nfor the dead which were then used. Such is this of Augustine; when he\nteaches that all men expect the resurrection of the body and eternal\nglory, and that every individual enters on the fruition of that rest which\nfollows after death, if he is worthy of it when he dies. Therefore he\ndeclares that all the pious, as well as the prophets, apostles, and\nmartyrs, enjoy a blessed repose immediately after death. If such be their\ncondition, what advantage will our prayers confer on them? I pass over\nthose grosser superstitions with which they have fascinated the minds of\nthe simple; which nevertheless are innumerable, and for the most part so\nmonstrous, that they cannot be varnished over by any honest pretext. I\nomit, also, that most disgraceful traffic which they licentiously carried\non while the world was in such a state of stupidity. For I should never\narrive at a conclusion, and I have already furnished the pious reader with\nsufficient to establish his conscience."

          "title": "Chapter VI. The Life Of A Christian. Scriptural Arguments And Exhortations",
          "content": "To It.\nWe have said that the end of regeneration is, that the life of believers\nmay exhibit a symmetry and agreement between the righteousness of God and\ntheir obedience; and that thus they may confirm the adoption by which they\nare accepted as his children. But though the law of God contains in it\nthat newness of life by which his image is restored in us, yet since our\ntardiness needs much stimulation and assistance, it will be useful to\ncollect from various places of Scripture a rule for the reformation of the\nlife, that they who cordially repent may not be bewildered in their\npursuits. Now, when I undertake the regulation of a Christian’s life, I\nknow that I am entering on an argument various and copious, and the\nmagnitude of which might fill a large volume, if I designed a complete\ndiscussion of every part of it. For we see to what great prolixity the\nfathers have extended the exhortations composed by them only on single\nvirtues; and that without any excessive loquacity; for, whatever virtue it\nis intended to recommend in an oration, the copiousness of the matter\nnaturally produces such a diffusiveness of style, that unless you have\nspoken largely, you seem not to have done justice to the subject. But my\ndesign is not to extend the plan of life, which I am now about to deliver,\nso far as particularly to discourse on each distinct virtue, and expatiate\ninto exhortations. These things may be sought in the writings of others,\nespecially in the homilies of the fathers. It will be sufficient for me if\nI point out a method by which a pious man may be conducted to the right\nend in the regulation of his life, and briefly assign a universal rule, by\nwhich he may properly estimate his duties. There will, perhaps, at some\nfuture period be a suitable opportunity for declamations; or I shall leave\nto others an office for which I am not calculated. I am naturally fond of\nbrevity; and, perhaps, were I desirous of speaking in a more copious\nmanner, I should not succeed. And if a more prolix method of teaching were\nmost acceptable, yet I should scarcely be inclined to make the trial. The\nplan of the present work, however, requires me to treat a simple doctrine\nwith all possible brevity. As the philosophers have certain principles of\nrectitude and honour, whence they deduce particular duties and the whole\ncircle of virtues, so the Scripture is not without its order in this\nrespect, but maintains an economy superlatively beautiful, and far more\ncertain, than all the systems of the philosophers. There is only this\ndifference—that, the philosophers being ambitious men, they have\nsedulously affected an exquisite perspicuity of method, in order to make\nan ostentatious display of their ingenious dexterity. But the Spirit,\nwhose teaching is void of affectation, has not so exactly or perpetually\nobserved a methodical plan; which, nevertheless, by using it in some\nplaces, he sufficiently indicates ought not to be neglected by us.\nII. This Scripture plan, of which we are now treating, consists chiefly in\nthese two things—the first, that a love of righteousness, to which we have\notherwise no natural propensity, be instilled and introduced into our\nhearts; the second, that a rule be prescribed to us, to prevent our taking\nany devious steps in the race of righteousness. Now, in the recommendation\nof righteousness, it uses a great number of very excellent arguments, many\nof which we have before noticed on different occasions, and some we shall\nbriefly touch on in this place. With what better foundation can it begin,\nthan when it admonishes us that we ought to be holy, because _our God is\nholy_?(1821) For when we were dispersed like scattered sheep, and lost in\nthe labyrinth of the world, he gathered us together again, that he might\nassociate us to himself. When we hear any mention of our union with God,\nwe should remember, that holiness must be the bond of it; not that we\nattain communion with him by the merit of holiness, (since it is rather\nnecessary for us, in the first place, to adhere to him, in order that,\nbeing endued with his holiness, we may follow whither he calls;) but\nbecause it is a peculiar property of his glory not to have any intercourse\nwith iniquity and uncleanness. Wherefore also it teaches, that this is the\nend of our vocation, which it is requisite for us always to keep in view,\nif we desire to correspond to the design of God in calling us. For to what\npurpose was it that we were delivered from the iniquity and pollution of\nthe world, in which we had been immerged, if we permit ourselves to wallow\nin them as long as we live? Besides, it also admonishes us that, to be\nnumbered among the people of God, we must inhabit the holy city\nJerusalem;(1822) which, he having consecrated it to himself, cannot\nwithout impiety be profaned by impure inhabitants. Whence these\nexpressions: “He shall abide in the tabernacle of the Lord, that walketh\nuprightly and worketh righteousness,” &c.,(1823) because it is very\nunbecoming the sanctuary which he inhabits, to be rendered as filthy as a\nstable.\nIII. And as a further incitement to us, it shows, that as God the Father\nhas reconciled us to himself in Christ, so he has exhibited to us in him a\npattern, to which it is his will that we should be conformed.(1824) Now,\nlet those who are of opinion that the philosophers have the only just and\norderly systems of moral philosophy, show me, in any of their works, a\nmore excellent economy than that which I have stated. When they intend to\nexhort us to the sublimest virtue, they advance no argument but that we\nought to live agreeably to nature; but the Scripture deduces its\nexhortation from the true source, when it not only enjoins us to refer our\nlife to God the author of it, to whom it belongs, but, after having taught\nus, that we are degenerated from the original state in which we were\ncreated, adds, that Christ, by whom we have been reconciled to God, is\nproposed to us as an example, whose character we should exhibit in our\nlives. What can be required more efficacious than this one consideration?\nindeed, what can be required besides? For if the Lord has adopted us as\nhis sons on this condition,—that we exhibit in our life an imitation of\nChrist the bond of our adoption,—unless we addict and devote ourselves to\nrighteousness, we not only most perfidiously revolt from our Creator, but\nalso abjure him as our Saviour. The Scripture derives matter of\nexhortation from all the blessings of God which it recounts to us, and\nfrom all the parts of our salvation. It argues, that since God has\ndiscovered himself as a Father to us, we must be convicted of the basest\ningratitude, unless we, on our part, manifest ourselves to be his\nchildren; that since Christ has purified us in the laver of his blood, and\nhas communicated this purification by baptism, it does not become us to be\ndefiled with fresh pollution; that since he has united us to his body, we\nshould, as his members, solicitously beware lest we asperse ourselves with\nany blemish or disgrace; that since he who is our Head has ascended to\nheaven, we ought to divest ourselves of all terrestrial affection, and\naspire thither with all our soul; that since the Holy Spirit has dedicated\nus as temples to God, we should use our utmost exertions, that the glory\nof God may be displayed by us; and ought not to allow ourselves to be\nprofaned with the pollution of sin; that since both our soul and our body\nare destined to heavenly incorruption and a never‐fading crown, we ought\nto exert our most strenuous efforts to preserve them pure and uncorrupt\ntill the day of the Lord. These, I say, are the best foundations for the\nproper regulation of the life, such as we cannot find in the philosophers;\nwho, in the recommendation of virtue, never rise above the natural dignity\nof man.\nIV. This is a proper place to address those who have nothing but the name\nand the symbol of Christ, and yet would be denominated Christians. But\nwith what face do they glory in his sacred name? For none have any\nintercourse with Christ but those who have received the true knowledge of\nhim from the word of the gospel. Now, the apostle denies that any have\nrightly learned Christ, who have not been taught that they must put off\nthe old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and put on\nChrist.(1825) Their knowledge of Christ, then, is proved to be a false and\ninjurious pretence, with whatever eloquence and volubility they may talk\nconcerning the gospel. For it is a doctrine not of the tongue, but of the\nlife; and is not apprehended merely with the understanding and memory,\nlike other sciences, but is then only received, when it possesses the\nwhole soul, and finds a seat and residence in the inmost affection of the\nheart. Let them, therefore, either cease to insult God by boasting\nthemselves to be what they are not, or show themselves disciples not\nunworthy of Christ, their Master. We have allotted the first place to the\ndoctrine which contains our religion, because it is the origin of our\nsalvation; but that it may not be unprofitable to us, it must be\ntransfused into our breast, pervade our manners, and thus transform us\ninto itself. If the philosophers are justly incensed against, and banish\nwith disgrace from their society, those who, while they profess an art\nwhich ought to be a rule of life, convert it into a sophistical\nloquacity,—with how much better reason may we detest those sophists who\nare contented to have the gospel on their lips, whilst its efficacy ought\nto penetrate the inmost affections of the heart, to dwell in the soul, and\nto affect the whole man with a hundred times more energy than the frigid\nexhortations of the philosophers!\nV. Yet I would not insist upon it as absolutely necessary, that the\nmanners of a Christian should breathe nothing but the perfect gospel;\nwhich, nevertheless, ought both to be wished and to be aimed at. But I do\nnot so rigorously require evangelical perfection as not to acknowledge as\na Christian, one who has not yet attained to it; for then all would be\nexcluded from the Church; since no man can be found who is not still at a\ngreat distance from it; and many have hitherto made but a very small\nprogress, whom it would, nevertheless, be unjust to reject. What then? let\nus set before our eyes that mark, to which alone our pursuit must be\ndirected. Let that be prescribed as the goal towards which we must\nearnestly tend. For it is not lawful for you to make such a compromise\nwith God, as to undertake a part of the duties prescribed to you in his\nword, and to omit part of them, at your own pleasure. For, in the first\nplace, he every where recommends integrity as a principal branch of his\nworship; by which he intends a sincere simplicity of heart, free from all\nguile and falsehood; the opposite of which is a double heart; as though it\nhad been said, that the beginning of a life of uprightness is spiritual,\nwhen the internal affection of the mind is unfeignedly devoted to God in\nthe cultivation of holiness and righteousness. But since no man in this\nterrestrial and corporeal prison has strength sufficient to press forward\nin his course with a due degree of alacrity, and the majority are\noppressed with such great debility, that they stagger and halt, and even\ncreep on the ground, and so make very inconsiderable advances,—let us\nevery one proceed according to our small ability, and prosecute the\njourney we have begun. No man will be so unhappy, but that he may every\nday make some progress, however small. Therefore, let us not cease to\nstrive, that we may be incessantly advancing in the way of the Lord; nor\nlet us despair on account of the smallness of our success; for however our\nsuccess may not correspond to our wishes, yet our labour is not lost, when\nthis day surpasses the preceding one; provided that, with sincere\nsimplicity, we keep our end in view, and press forward to the goal, not\npractising self‐adulation, nor indulging our own evil propensities, but\nperpetually exerting our endeavours after increasing degrees of\namelioration, till we shall have arrived at a perfection of goodness,\nwhich, indeed, we seek and pursue as long as we live, and shall then\nattain, when, divested of all corporeal infirmity, we shall be admitted by\nGod into complete communion with him."

          "title": "Chapter VII. Summary Of The Christian Life. Self‐Denial.",
          "content": "Although the Divine law contains a most excellent and well‐arranged plan\nfor the regulation of life, yet it has pleased the heavenly Teacher to\nconform men by a more accurate doctrine to the rule which he had\nprescribed in the law. And the principle of that doctrine is this—that it\nis the duty of believers to “present their bodies a living sacrifice,\nholy, acceptable unto God;”(1826) and that in this consists the legitimate\nworship of him. Hence is deduced an argument for exhorting them, “Be not\nconformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your\nmind, that ye may prove what is that will of God.” This is a very\nimportant consideration, that we are consecrated and dedicated to God;\nthat we may not hereafter think, speak, meditate, or do any thing but with\na view to his glory. For that which is sacred cannot, without great\ninjustice towards him, be applied to unholy uses. If we are not our own,\nbut the Lord’s, it is manifest both what error we must avoid, and to what\nend all the actions of our lives are to be directed. We are not our own;\ntherefore neither our reason nor our will should predominate in our\ndeliberations and actions. We are not our own; therefore let us not\npropose it as our end, to seek what may be expedient for us according to\nthe flesh. We are not our own; therefore let us, as far as possible,\nforget ourselves and all things that are ours. On the contrary, we are\nGod’s; to him, therefore, let us live and die. We are God’s; therefore let\nhis wisdom and will preside in all our actions. We are God’s; towards him,\ntherefore, as our only legitimate end, let every part of our lives be\ndirected. O, how great a proficiency has that man made, who, having been\ntaught that he is not his own, has taken the sovereignty and government of\nhimself from his own reason, to surrender it to God! For as compliance\nwith their own inclinations leads men most effectually to ruin, so to\nplace no dependence on our own knowledge or will, but merely to follow the\nguidance of the Lord, is the only way of safety. Let this, then, be the\nfirst step, to depart from ourselves, that we may apply all the vigour of\nour faculties to the service of the Lord. By service I mean, not that only\nwhich consists in verbal obedience, but that by which the human mind,\ndivested of its natural carnality, resigns itself wholly to the direction\nof the Divine Spirit. Of this transformation, which Paul styles a\nrenovation of the mind,(1827) though it is the first entrance into life,\nall the philosophers were ignorant. For they set up Reason as the sole\ndirectress of man; they think that she is exclusively to be attended to;\nin short, to her alone they assign the government of the conduct. But the\nChristian philosophy commands her to give place and submit to the Holy\nSpirit; so that now the man himself lives not, but carries about Christ\nliving and reigning within him.(1828)\nII. Hence also that other consequence, that we should seek not our own\nthings, but those which are agreeable to the will of the Lord, and\nconducive to the promotion of his glory. This also argues a great\nproficiency, that almost forgetting ourselves, and certainly neglecting\nall selfish regards, we endeavour faithfully to devote our attention to\nGod and his commandments. For when the Scripture enjoins us to discard all\nprivate and selfish considerations, it not only erases from our minds the\ncupidity of wealth, the lust of power, and the favour of men, but also\neradicates ambition and all appetite after human glory, with other more\nsecret plagues. Indeed, a Christian man ought to be so disposed and\nprepared, as to reflect that he has to do with God every moment of his\nlife. Thus, as he will measure all his actions by his will and\ndetermination, so he will refer the whole bias of his mind religiously to\nhim. For he who has learned to regard God in every undertaking, is also\nraised above every vain imagination. This is that denial of ourselves,\nwhich Christ, from the commencement of their course, so diligently enjoins\non his disciples; which, when it has once obtained the government of the\nheart, leaves room neither for pride, haughtiness, or ostentation, nor for\navarice, libidinousness, luxury, effeminacy, or any other evils which are\nthe offspring of self‐love. On the contrary, wherever it does not reign,\nthere either the grossest vices are indulged without the least shame; or,\nif there exist any appearance of virtue, it is vitiated by a depraved\npassion for glory. Show me, if you can, a single individual, who, unless\nhe has renounced himself according to the command of the Lord, is\nvoluntarily disposed to practise virtue among men. For all who have not\nbeen influenced by this disposition, have followed virtue merely from the\nlove of praise. And even those of the philosophers who have ever contended\nthat virtue is desirable for its own sake, have been inflated with so much\narrogance, that it is evident they desired virtue for no other reason than\nto furnish them occasion for the exercise of pride. But God is so far from\nbeing delighted, either with those who are ambitious of popular praise, or\nwith hearts so full of pride and presumption, that he pronounces “they\nhave their reward” in this world, and represents harlots and publicans as\nnearer to the kingdom of heaven than such persons. But we have not yet\nclearly stated the number and magnitude of the obstacles by which a man is\nimpeded in the pursuit of that which is right, as long as he has refrained\nfrom all self‐denial. For it is an ancient and true observation, that\nthere is a world of vices concealed in the soul of man. Nor can you find\nany other remedy than to deny yourself and discard all selfish\nconsiderations, and to devote your whole attention to the pursuit of those\nthings which the Lord requires of you, and which ought to be pursued for\nthis sole reason, because they are pleasing to him.\nIII. The same apostle, in another place, gives a more distinct, though a\nbrief, representation of all the parts of a well‐regulated life. “The\ngrace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching\nus, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,\nrighteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed\nhope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\nChrist, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all\niniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good\nworks.”(1829) For after having proposed the grace of God to animate us, in\norder to prepare the way for us truly to worship God, he removes two\nobstacles, which are our chief impediments; first, ungodliness, to which\nwe have naturally too strong a propensity, and secondly, worldly lusts,\nwhich extend themselves further. The term “ungodliness” not only denotes\nsuperstitions, but comprehends also every thing that is repugnant to the\nserious fear of God. And “worldly lusts” mean the carnal affections.\nTherefore he enjoins us, with reference to both tables of the law, to\nforsake our former propensities, and to renounce all the dictates of our\nown reason and will. He reduces all the actions of life to three\nclasses—sobriety, righteousness, and godliness. “Sobriety” undoubtedly\ndenotes chastity and temperance, as well as a pure and frugal use of\ntemporal blessings, and patience under poverty. “Righteousness” includes\nall the duties of equity, that every man may receive what is his due.\n“Godliness” separates us from the pollutions of the world, and by true\nholiness unites us to God. When these virtues are indissolubly connected,\nthey produce absolute perfection. But since nothing is more difficult than\nto forsake all carnal considerations, to subdue and renounce our\nappetites, to devote ourselves to God and our brethren, and to live the\nlife of angels amidst the corruptions of the world,—in order to extricate\nour minds from every snare, Paul recalls our attention to the hope of a\nblessed immortality; apprizing us that our efforts are not in vain;\nbecause, as Christ once appeared as a Redeemer, so, at his final advent,\nhe will manifest the benefits of the salvation he has obtained. Thus he\ndispels the fascinations which blind us, and prevent our aspiring with\nbecoming ardour to the glories of heaven, and at the same time teaches us\nthat we must live as strangers and pilgrims in the world, that we may not\nlose the heavenly inheritance.\nIV. In these words we perceive, that self‐denial relates partly to men,\nbut partly, and indeed principally, to God. For when the Scripture enjoins\nus to conduct ourselves in such a manner towards men, as in honour to\nprefer one another, and faithfully to devote our whole attention to the\npromotion of their advantage,(1830) it gives such commands as our heart\ncan by no means receive, without having been previously divested of its\nnatural bias. For we are all so blinded and fascinated with self‐love,\nthat every one imagines he has a just right to exalt himself, and to\nundervalue all others who stand in competition with him. If God has\nconferred on us any valuable qualification, relying thereon, our hearts\nare immediately lifted up; and we not only swell, but almost burst with\npride. The vices in which we abound, we sedulously conceal from others,\nand flatter ourselves with the pretence that they are diminutive and\ntrivial, and even sometimes embrace them as virtues. If the same talents\nwhich we admire in ourselves, or even superior ones, appear in others, in\norder that we may not be obliged to acknowledge their superiority, we\ndepreciate and diminish them with the utmost malignity: if they have any\nvices, not content to notice them with severe and sharp animadversions, we\nodiously amplify them. Hence that insolence, that every one of us, as if\nexempted from the common lot, is desirous of pre‐eminence above the rest\nof mankind; and severely and haughtily contemns every man, or at least\ndespises him as an inferior. The poor yield to the rich, plebeians to\nnobles, servants to masters, the illiterate to the learned; but there is\nno man who does not cherish within him some idea of his own excellence.\nThus all men, in flattering themselves, carry, as it were, a kingdom in\ntheir own breast; for arrogating to themselves the height of self‐\ngratulation, they pass censure on the understandings and conduct of\nothers; but if any contention arises, it produces an eruption of the\npoison. For many discover some gentleness, as long as they find every\nthing pleasant and amiable; but how many are there who preserve the same\nconstant course of good humour when they are disturbed and irritated? Nor\nis there any other remedy, than the eradication from the inmost recesses\nof the heart of this most noxious pest of ambition and self‐love; as it is\nindeed eradicated by the doctrine of the Scripture. For if we attend to\nits instructions, we must remember, that the talents with which God has\nfavoured us, are not excellences originating from ourselves, but free\ngifts of God; of which if any are proud, they betray their ingratitude.\n“Who maketh thee to differ?” saith Paul. “Now, if thou didst receive all\nthings, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received them?”(1831) In\nthe next place, by assiduous observation and acknowledgment of our faults,\nwe must recall our minds to humility. Thus there will remain in us nothing\nto inflate us, but great reason for dejection. On the other hand, we are\nenjoined, whatever gifts of God we perceive in others, to revere and\nesteem them, so as to honour those in whom they reside. For it would\nbetray great wickedness in us to rob them of that honour which God has\ngiven them. Their faults we are taught to overlook, not indeed to\nencourage them by adulation, but never on account of them to insult those\nwhom we ought to cherish with benevolence and honour. The result of\nattention to these directions will be, that with whomsoever we are\nconcerned, we shall conduct ourselves not only with moderation and good\nhumour, but with civility and friendship. For we shall never arrive at\ntrue meekness by any other way, than by having our hearts imbued with\nself‐abasement and a respect for others.\nV. How extremely difficult it is for you to discharge your duty in seeking\nthe advantage of your neighbour! Unless you quit all selfish\nconsiderations, and, as it were, lay aside yourself, you will effect\nnothing in this duty. For how can you perform those which Paul inculcates\nas works of charity, unless you renounce yourself, and devote yourself\nwholly to serve others? “Charity,” says he, “suffereth long, and is kind;\ncharity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth\nnot behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,”\n&c.(1832) If this be all that is required, that we seek not our own, yet\nwe must do no small violence to nature, which so strongly inclines us to\nthe exclusive love of ourselves, that it does not so easily permit us to\nneglect ourselves and our own concerns in order to be vigilant for the\nadvantage of others, and even voluntarily to recede from our right, to\nresign it to another. But the Scripture leads us to this, admonishes us,\nthat whatever favours we obtain from the Lord, we are intrusted with them\non this condition, that they should be applied to the common benefit of\nthe Church; and that, therefore, the legitimate use of all his favours, is\na liberal and kind communication of them to others. There cannot be\nimagined a more certain rule, or a more powerful exhortation to the\nobservance of it, than when we are taught, that all the blessings we enjoy\nare Divine deposits, committed to our trust on this condition, that they\nshould be dispensed for the benefit of our neighbours. But the Scripture\ngoes still further, when it compares them to the powers with which the\nmembers of the human body are endued. For no member has its power for\nitself, nor applies it to its private use; but transfuses it among its\nfellow‐members, receiving no advantage from it but what proceeds from the\ncommon convenience of the whole body. So, whatever ability a pious man\npossesses, he ought to possess it for his brethren, consulting his own\nprivate interest in no way inconsistent with a cordial attention to the\ncommon edification of the Church. Let this, then, be our rule for\nbenignity and beneficence,—that whatever God has conferred on us, which\nenables us to assist our neighbour, we are the stewards of it, and must\none day render an account of our stewardship; and that the only right\ndispensation of what has been committed to us, is that which is regulated\nby the law of love. Thus we shall not only always connect the study to\npromote the advantage of others with a concern for our own private\ninterests, but shall prefer the good of others to our own. To teach us\nthat the dispensation of the gifts we receive from heaven ought to be\nregulated by this law, God anciently enjoined the same even in regard to\nthe smallest bounties of his liberality. For he commanded the people to\noffer to him the first‐fruits of the corn, as a solemn avowal that it was\nunlawful for them to enjoy any blessings not previously consecrated to\nhim. And if the gifts of God are not sanctified to us till after we have\nwith our own hands dedicated them to their Author, that must evidently be\na sinful abuse which is unconnected with such a dedication. But in vain\nwould you attempt to enrich the Lord by a communication of your\npossessions. Therefore, since your “goodness extendeth not to him,”(1833)\nas the Psalmist says, you must exercise it “towards the saints that are in\nthe earth;” and alms are compared to sacred oblations, to show that these\nexercises of charity under the gospel, correspond to those offerings under\nthe law.\nVI. Moreover, that we may not be weary of doing good, which otherwise\nwould of necessity soon be the case, we must add also the other character\nmentioned by the apostle, that “charity suffereth long, and is not easily\nprovoked.” The Lord commands us to do “good unto all men,”(1834)\nuniversally, a great part of whom, estimated according to their own\nmerits, are very undeserving; but here the Scripture assists us with an\nexcellent rule, when it inculcates, that we must not regard the intrinsic\nmerit of men, but must consider the image of God in them, to which we owe\nall possible honour and love; but that this image is most carefully to be\nobserved in them “who are of the household of faith,”(1835) inasmuch as it\nis renewed and restored by the Spirit of Christ. Whoever, therefore, is\npresented to you that needs your kind offices, you have no reason to\nrefuse him your assistance. Say that he is a stranger; yet the Lord has\nimpressed on him a character which ought to be familiar to you; for which\nreason he forbids you to despise your own flesh.(1836) Say that he is\ncontemptible and worthless; but the Lord shows him to be one whom he has\ndeigned to grace with his own image. Say that you are obliged to him for\nno services; but God has made him, as it were, his substitute, to whom you\nacknowledge yourself to be under obligations for numerous and important\nbenefits. Say that he is unworthy of your making the smallest exertion on\nhis account; but the image of God, by which he is recommended to you,\ndeserves your surrender of yourself and all that you possess. If he not\nonly has deserved no favour, but, on the contrary, has provoked you with\ninjuries and insults,—even this is no just reason why you should cease to\nembrace him with your affection, and to perform to him the offices of\nlove. He has deserved, you will say, very different treatment from me. But\nwhat has the Lord deserved? who, when he commands you to forgive men all\ntheir offences against you, certainly intends that they should be charged\nto himself. This is the only way of attaining that which is not only\ndifficult, but utterly repugnant to the nature of man—to love them who\nhate us,(1837) to requite injuries with kindnesses, and to return\nblessings for curses.(1838) We should remember, that we must not reflect\non the wickedness of men, but contemplate the Divine image in them; which,\nconcealing and obliterating their faults, by its beauty and dignity\nallures us to embrace them in the arms of our love.\nVII. This mortification, therefore, will not take place in us unless we\nfulfil all the duties of charity. These are fulfilled, not by him who\nmerely performs all the external offices of charity, even without the\nomission of one, but by him who does this from a sincere principle of\nlove. For it may happen, that a man may fully discharge his duty to all\nmen, with respect to external actions, and, at the same time, be very far\nfrom discharging it in the right way. For you may see some men who would\nbe thought extremely liberal, and yet never bestow any thing without\nupbraiding, either by pride of countenance, or by insolence of language.\nAnd we are sunk to such a depth of calamity in this unhappy age, that\nscarcely any alms are given, at least by the majority of mankind, but in a\nhaughty and contemptuous manner—a corruption which ought not to have been\ntolerated even among heathen; for of Christians there is something further\nrequired, than to display a cheerfulness of countenance, and to render\ntheir benefactions amiable by civility of language. In the first place,\nthey ought to imagine themselves in the situation of the person who needs\ntheir assistance, and to commiserate his case, just as though they\nthemselves felt and suffered the same; so that they may be impelled, by a\nsense of mercy and humanity, to afford assistance to him as readily as if\nit were to themselves. He who comes to the assistance of his brethren\nunder the influence of such a disposition, not only will not contaminate\nhis services with arrogance or reproach, but will neither despise his\nbrother who is the object of his beneficence, as needing assistance, nor\ndomineer over him as under an obligation to him; no more, for instance,\nthan we insult a diseased member, for whose restoration the rest of the\nbody labours, or suppose it to be under particular obligations to the\nother members, because it has needed more assistance than it returned. For\nthe communication of services between the members of the body, is esteemed\nto be in no sense gratuitous, but rather a discharge of that which, being\ndue by the law of nature, it would be monstrous to refuse. And for this\nreason, he will not suppose himself to have discharged all his duty, who\nhas performed one kind of service; as it generally happens, that a rich\nman, after having bestowed some part of his property, leaves other burdens\nto be borne by other persons, and considers himself as exempted from all\nconcern about them. On the contrary, every man will reflect with himself,\nthat however great he may be, he is a debtor to his neighbour, and that no\nbounds should be fixed to the exercise of beneficence towards them, except\nwhen his ability fails, which, as far as it extends, ought to be limited\nby the rule of charity.\nVIII. Let us describe again, more at large, the principal branch of self‐\ndenial, which we have said relates to God; and indeed many observations\nhave already been made concerning it, which it would be needless to\nrepeat: it will be sufficient to show how it habituates us to equanimity\nand patience. First, therefore, in seeking the convenience or tranquillity\nof the present life, the Scripture calls us to this point; that resigning\nourselves and all that we have to the will of God, we should surrender to\nhim the affections of our heart, to be conquered and reduced to\nsubjection. To desire wealth and honours, to be ambitious of power, to\naccumulate riches, to amass all those vanities which appear conducive to\nmagnificence and pomp, our passion is furious, and our cupidity unbounded.\nOn the contrary, to poverty, obscurity, and meanness, we feel a wonderful\nfear and abhorrence, which stimulate us to avoid them by all possible\nmeans. Hence we may see, how restless the minds of all those persons are,\nwho regulate their lives according to their own reason; how many arts they\ntry, and with what exertions they fatigue themselves, in order, on the one\nhand, to obtain the objects of ambition or avarice, on the other, to avoid\npoverty and meanness. Pious men, therefore, that they may not be involved\nin such snares, must pursue the following course: First, let them neither\ndesire, nor hope, nor entertain a thought of prosperity, from any other\ncause than the Divine blessing; and on that let them securely and\nconfidently depend. For however the flesh may appear to itself to be\nabundantly sufficient, when it either attempts by its own industry, or\nstrenuous exertions, to attain honours and wealth, or is assisted by the\nfavour of man,—yet it is certain, that all these things are nothing, and\nthat we shall obtain no advantage, either by ingenuity or by labour, but\nas far as the Lord shall prosper both. On the contrary, his benediction\nalone finds a way, even through all impediments, so as to bring all our\naffairs to a joyful and prosperous conclusion. And though we may, for the\nmost part, be able without it to obtain for ourselves some degree of\nopulence and glory, as we daily behold impious men accumulating great\nhonours and enormous wealth, yet, since those who are under the curse of\nGod enjoy not even the smallest particle of happiness, we shall acquire\nnothing without the Divine blessing, which will not eventually prove a\ncalamity to us. And that is by no means to be desired, the acquisition of\nwhich renders men more miserable.\nIX. Therefore, if we believe that all the cause of desirable prosperity\nconsists in the Divine benediction alone, without which miseries and\ncalamities of every kind await us, it follows also, that we should not\npassionately strive for wealth and honours, either relying on our own\ndiligence or acuteness of understanding, or depending on the favour of\nmen, or confiding in a vain imagination of chance; but that we should\nalways regard the Lord, to be conducted by his direction to whatsoever lot\nhe has provided for us. The consequence of this will be, in the first\nplace, that we shall not rush forward to seize on wealth or honours by\nunlawful actions, by deceitful and criminal arts, by rapacity and injury\nof our neighbours; but shall confine ourselves to the pursuit of those\ninterests, which will not seduce us from the path of innocence. For who\ncan expect the assistance of the Divine benediction, amidst fraud, rapine,\nand other iniquitous acts? For as that follows him only whose thoughts are\npure, and whose actions are upright, so it calls away all those by whom it\nis sought, from irregular thoughts and corrupt practices. In the next\nplace, we shall find a restraint laid upon us, to keep us from being\ninflamed with an inordinate desire of growing rich, and from ambitiously\naspiring after honours. For with what face can any man confide in the\nassistance of God, towards obtaining things which he desires in opposition\nto the Divine word? Far be it from God to follow with the aid of his\nblessing, what he curses with his mouth. Lastly, if our success be not\nequal to our wishes and hopes, yet we shall be restrained from impatience,\nand from execrating our condition, whatever it may be; because we shall\nknow, that this would be murmuring against God, at whose pleasure are\ndispensed riches and poverty, honour and contempt. In short, he who shall\nrepose himself, in the manner we have mentioned, on the Divine blessing,\nwill neither hunt after the objects violently coveted by men in general,\nby evil methods, from which he will expect no advantage; nor will he\nimpute any prosperous event to himself, and to his own diligence,\nindustry, or good fortune; but will acknowledge God to be the author of\nit. If, while the affairs of others are flourishing, he makes but a small\nprogress, or even moves in a retrograde direction, yet he will bear his\npoverty with more equanimity and moderation, than any profane man would\nfeel with a mediocrity of success, which would merely be inferior to his\nwishes; possessing, indeed, a consolation in which he may enjoy more\ntranquil satisfaction, than in the zenith of opulence or power; because he\nconsiders, that his affairs are ordered by the Lord in such a manner as is\nconducive to his salvation. This, we see, was the disposition of David,\nwho, while he follows God, surrenders himself to his government, and\ndeclares, that he is “as a child that is weaned of his mother; neither do\nI exercise myself,” says he, “in great matters, or in things too high for\nme.”(1839)\nX. Nor is this the only instance in which pious persons should feel such\ntranquillity and patience; the same state of mind ought to be extended to\nall the events to which the present life is exposed. Therefore no man has\nrightly renounced himself, but he who has wholly resigned himself to the\nLord, so as to leave all the parts of his life to be governed by his will.\nHe whose mind is thus composed, whatever may befall him, will neither\nthink himself miserable, nor invidiously complain against God on account\nof his lot. The great necessity of this disposition will appear, if we\nconsider the numerous accidents to which we are subject. Diseases of\nvarious kinds frequently attack us: at one time, the pestilence is raging;\nat another, we are cruelly harassed with the calamities of war; at another\ntime, frost or hail, devouring the hopes of the year, produces sterility,\nwhich brings us to penury; a wife, parents, children, or other relatives,\nare snatched away by death; our dwelling is consumed by a fire; these are\nthe events, on the occurrence of which, men curse this life, or their\nnatal day, execrate heaven and earth, reproach God, and, as they are\neloquent to blaspheme, accuse him of injustice and cruelty. But it behoves\na believer, even in these events, to contemplate the clemency and truly\npaternal goodness of God. Wherefore, if he sees his relatives removed, and\nhis house rendered a solitary place, he must not cease to bless the Lord,\nbut rather have recourse to this reflection: Yet the grace of the Lord,\nwhich inhabits my house, will not leave it desolate. Or if he sees his\ncrops bitten or destroyed by frost, or beaten down by hail, and famine\nthreatening him, yet he will not sink into despondency or displeasure\nagainst God, but will abide in this confidence—We are under the guardian\ncare of God, we are “the sheep of his pasture;”(1840) he therefore will\nsupply us with food even in seasons of the greatest barrenness. If he\nshall be afflicted with disease, even then he will not be so far\ndiscouraged by the bitterness of his pain, as to break out into\nimpatience, and to complain against God; but will rather strengthen his\npatience by a consideration of the justice and lenity of the Divine\ncorrection. Finally, whatever may happen, knowing it to be ordained by the\nLord, he will receive it with a placid and grateful heart, that he may not\nbe guilty of contumaciously resisting his authority, to whose power he has\nonce resigned himself and all that belongs to him. Far, therefore, from\nthe heart of a Christian man be that foolish and most wretched consolation\nof the heathen, who, to fortify their minds against adversity, imputed it\nto Fortune; with whom they esteemed it foolish to be displeased, because\nshe was thoughtless and rash, and blindly wounded without discrimination\nthe worthy and the unworthy. On the contrary, the rule of piety is, that\nGod alone is the arbiter and governor of all events, both prosperous and\nadverse, and that he does not proceed with inconsiderate impetuosity, but\ndispenses to us blessings and calamities with the most systematic justice."

          "title": "Chapter VIII. Bearing The Cross, Which Is A Branch Of Self‐Denial.",
          "content": "But it becomes a pious mind to rise still higher, even to that to which\nChrist calls his disciples; that every one should “take up his\ncross.”(1841) For all whom the Lord has chosen and honoured with admission\ninto the society of his saints, ought to prepare themselves for a life,\nhard, laborious, unquiet, and replete with numerous and various\ncalamities. It is the will of their heavenly Father to exercise them in\nthis manner, that he may have a certain proof of those that belong to him.\nHaving begun with Christ his first begotten Son, he pursues this method\ntowards all his children. For though Christ was above all others the\nbeloved Son, in whom the Father was always well pleased,(1842) yet we see\nhow little indulgence and tenderness he experienced; so that it may be\ntruly said, not only that he was perpetually burdened with a cross during\nhis residence on earth, but that his whole life was nothing but a kind of\nperpetual cross. The apostle assigns the reason, that it was necessary for\nhim to “learn obedience by the things which he suffered.”(1843) Why, then,\nshould we exempt ourselves from that condition, to which it behoved Christ\nour head to be subject; especially since his submission was on our\naccount, that he might exhibit to us an example of patience in his own\nperson? Wherefore the apostle teaches, that it is the destination of all\nthe children of God “to be conformed to him.”(1844) It is also a source of\nsignal consolation to us, in unpleasant and severe circumstances, which\nare esteemed adversities and calamities, that we partake of the sufferings\nof Christ; that as he from a labyrinth of all evils entered into the glory\nof heaven, so we are conducted forward through various tribulations to the\nsame glory;(1845) for Paul teaches us, that when we “know the fellowship\nof his sufferings,” we also apprehend “the power of his resurrection;”\nthat while we are conformed to his death, we are thus prepared to partake\nof his glorious resurrection.(1846) How much is this adapted to alleviate\nall the bitterness of the cross, that the more we are afflicted by\nadversities, our fellowship with Christ is so much the more certainly\nconfirmed! By this communion the sufferings themselves not only become\nblessings to us, but afford considerable assistance towards promoting our\nsalvation.\nII. Besides, our Lord was under no necessity of bearing the cross, except\nto testify and prove his obedience to his Father; but there are many\nreasons which render it necessary for us to live under a continual cross.\nFirst, as we are naturally too prone to attribute every thing to our\nflesh, unless we have, as it were, ocular demonstration of our imbecility,\nwe easily form an extravagant estimate of our strength, presuming that\nwhatever may happen, it will remain undaunted and invincible amidst all\ndifficulties. This inflates us with a foolish, vain, carnal confidence;\nrelying on which, we become contumacious and proud, in opposition to God\nhimself, just as though our own powers were sufficient for us without his\ngrace. This arrogance he cannot better repress, than by proving to us from\nexperience, not only our great imbecility, but also our extreme frailty.\nTherefore he afflicts us with ignominy, or poverty, or loss of relatives,\nor disease, or other calamities; to the bearing of which being in\nourselves unequal, we ere long sink under them. Thus being humbled, we\nlearn to invoke his strength, which alone causes us to stand erect under a\nload of afflictions. Moreover, the greatest saints, though sensible that\nthey stand by the grace of God, not by their own strength, are\nnevertheless more secure than they ought to be of their fortitude and\nconstancy, unless he leads them by the discipline of the cross into a\ndeeper knowledge of themselves. This presumption insinuated itself even\ninto David: “In my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved; Lord, by thy\nfavour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong. Thou didst hide thy\nface, and I was troubled.”(1847) For he confesses that his senses were so\nstupefied and benumbed by prosperity, that disregarding the grace of God,\non which he ought to have depended, he relied on himself, so as to promise\nhimself a permanent standing. If this happened to so great a prophet, who\nof us should not be fearful and cautious? Though in prosperity, therefore,\nthey have flattered themselves with the notion of superior constancy and\npatience, yet when humbled by adversity, they learn that this was mere\nhypocrisy. Admonished by such evidences of their maladies, believers\nadvance in humility, and, divested of corrupt confidence in the flesh,\nbetake themselves to the grace of God; and when they have applied to it,\nthey experience the presence of the Divine strength, in which they find\nabundant protection.\nIII. This is what Paul teaches, that “tribulation worketh patience, and\npatience experience.”(1848) For the promise of God to believers, that he\nwill assist them in tribulations, they experience to be true, when they\npatiently stand supported by his power, which they certainly could not do\nby their own strength. Patience, therefore, affords a proof to the saints,\nthat God will really give the assistance he has promised in every time of\nneed. This also confirms their hope; for it would be too much ingratitude\nnot to rely on the truth of God for the future, which they have hitherto\nexperienced to be constant and certain. We see now what a series of\nbenefits we derive from the cross. For, subverting the opinion which we\nhave falsely preconceived of our own strength, and detecting our\nhypocrisy, with which we are enamoured, it expels pernicious and carnal\nconfidence; when we are thus humbled, it teaches us to rely upon God\nalone, which keeps us from sinking under afflictions. And victory is\nfollowed by hope; inasmuch as the Lord, by the performance of his\npromises, establishes his truth for the future. Though these were the only\nreasons that could be given, they are sufficient to show the necessity of\nthe discipline of the cross. For it is no small advantage to be divested\nof a blind self‐love, that we may be fully conscious of our imbecility; to\nbe affected with a sense of our imbecility, that we may learn to be\ndiffident of ourselves; to be diffident of ourselves, that we may transfer\nour confidence to God; to depend with unreserved confidence on God, that,\nrelying on his assistance, we may persevere unconquered to the end; to\nstand in his grace, that we may know his veracity in his promises; to\nexperience the certainty of his promises, that our hope may thereby be\nstrengthened.\nIV. The Lord has also another end in afflicting his children; to try their\npatience, and teach them obedience. Not, indeed, that they can perform any\nother obedience to him than that which he has given them; but he is\npleased in this manner, by clear evidences, to exhibit and testify the\ngraces which he has conferred on his saints, that they may not be\nconcealed in inactivity within them. Therefore, in giving an open\nmanifestation of the strength and constancy in suffering, with which he\nhas furnished his servants, he is said to try their patience. Hence these\nexpressions, that “God did tempt Abraham,” and prove his piety, from the\ncircumstance of his not refusing to sacrifice his own and only son.(1849)\nWherefore Peter states, that our faith is tried by tribulations, just as\ngold is tried by fire in a furnace.(1850) Now, who can say that it is not\nnecessary for this most excellent gift of patience, which a believer has\nreceived from his God, to be brought forward into use, that it may be\nascertained and manifested? For otherwise men will never esteem it as it\ndeserves. But if God himself acts justly, when, to prevent the virtues\nwhich he has conferred on believers from being concealed in obscurity and\nremaining useless and perishing, he furnishes an occasion for exciting\nthem,—there is the best of reasons for the afflictions of the saints,\nwithout which they would have no patience. By the cross they are also, I\nsay, instructed to obedience; because they are thus taught to live, not\naccording to their own inclination, but according to the will of God. If\nevery thing succeeded with them according to their wishes, they would not\nknow what it is to follow God. But Seneca mentions that this was an\nancient proverb, when they would exhort any one to bear adversity with\npatience, “Follow God.” This implied that man submitted to the yoke of\nGod, only when he resigned himself to his corrections. Now, if it is most\nreasonable that we should prove ourselves in all things obedient to our\nheavenly Father, we certainly ought not to deny him the use of every\nmethod to accustom us to practise this obedience.\nV. Yet we do not perceive how necessary this obedience is to us, unless we\nat the same time reflect on the great wantonness of our flesh to shake off\nthe Divine yoke, as soon as we have been treated with a little tenderness\nand indulgence. The case is exactly the same as with refractory horses,\nwhich, after having been pampered for some days in idleness, grow fierce\nand untamable, and regard not the rider, to whose management they\npreviously submitted. And we are perpetual examples of what God complains\nof in the people of Israel; when we are “waxen fat,” and are “covered with\nfatness,”(1851) we kick against him who has cherished and supported us.\nThe beneficence of God ought to have allured us to the consideration and\nlove of his goodness; but since such is our ingratitude, that we are\nrather constantly corrupted by his indulgence, it is highly necessary for\nus to be restrained by some discipline from breaking out into such\npetulance. Therefore, that we may not be made haughty by an excessive\nabundance of wealth, that we may not become proud on being distinguished\nwith honours, that we may not be rendered insolent by being inflated with\nother advantages, mental, corporeal, or external, the Lord himself, as he\nforesees will be expedient, by the remedy of the cross, opposes,\nrestrains, and subdues the haughtiness of our flesh; and that by various\nmethods, adapted to promote the benefit of each individual. For we are not\nall equally afflicted with the same diseases, or all in need of an equally\nsevere method of cure. Hence we see different persons exercised with\ndifferent kinds of crosses. But whilst the heavenly Physician, consulting\nthe health of all his patients, practises a milder treatment towards some,\nand cures others with rougher remedies, yet he leaves no one completely\nexempted, because he knows we are all diseased, without the exception of a\nsingle individual.\nVI. Moreover it is necessary that our most merciful Father should not only\nprevent our infirmity for the future, but also frequently correct our past\noffences, to preserve us in a course of legitimate obedience to himself.\nWherefore in every affliction we ought immediately to recollect the course\nof our past life. In reviewing it, we shall certainly find that we have\ncommitted what was deserving of such chastisement. Nevertheless the\nexhortation to patience must not be principally founded on a consciousness\nof sin. For the Scripture furnishes a far better consideration, when it\ninforms us, that in adversity “we are chastened of the Lord, that we\nshould not be condemned with the world.”(1852) Therefore, even in the\nbitterness of tribulations, it becomes us to acknowledge the clemency and\nbenignity of our Father towards us; since even then he ceases not to\npromote our salvation. For he afflicts, not to ruin or destroy us, but\nrather to deliver us from the condemnation of the world. This idea will\nlead us to what the Scripture inculcates in another place: “My son,\ndespise not the chastening of the Lord, neither be weary of his\ncorrection; for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, even as a father the\nson in whom he delighteth.”(1853) When we recognize the rod of a father,\nis it not our duty rather to show ourselves obedient and docile children,\nthan contumaciously to imitate desperate men, who have been hardened in\ntheir transgressions? God loses us, unless he recalls us after our\ndefections from him; so that the apostle correctly remarks, “If ye be\nwithout chastisement, then are ye bastards, and not sons.”(1854) We are\nextremely perverse, therefore, if we cannot bear with him, while he\ndeclares his benevolence towards us, and his great concern for our\nsalvation. The Scripture points out this difference between believers and\nunbelievers; the latter, as the slaves of an inveterate and incurable\niniquity, are only rendered more wicked and obstinate by correction; the\nformer, like ingenuous children, are led to a salutary repentance. You\nhave to choose now in which number you would prefer to stand. But having\ntreated of this subject elsewhere, I shall conclude, contenting myself\nwith having thus briefly touched on it here.\nVII. But it is a source of peculiar consolation when we suffer persecution\n“for righteousness’ sake.”(1855) For we ought then to reflect how greatly\nwe are honoured by God, when he thus distinguishes us with the peculiar\ncharacteristic of his service. I call it persecution for righteousness’\nsake, not only when we suffer in defence of the gospel, but also when we\nare molested in the vindication of any just cause. Whether, therefore, in\nasserting the truth of God, in opposition to the falsehoods of Satan, or\nin undertaking the protection of good and innocent men against the\ninjuries of the wicked, it be necessary for us to incur the resentment and\nhatred of the world, by which our lives, our fortunes, or our reputation,\nmay be endangered,—let it not be grievous or irksome to us thus far to\nemploy ourselves in the service of God; nor let us imagine ourselves to be\nmiserable in those respects in which he has with his own mouth pronounced\nus blessed. It is true, that poverty, considered in itself, is misery; and\nthe same may be said of exile, contempt, imprisonment, ignominy; finally,\ndeath is of all calamities the last and worst. But with the favour of our\nGod, they are all conducive to our happiness. Let us therefore be content\nwith the testimony of Christ, rather than with the false opinion of the\nflesh. Thus we shall rejoice, like the apostles, whenever he shall “count\nus worthy to suffer shame for his name.”(1856) For if, being innocent and\nconscious of our own integrity, we are stripped of our property by the\nvillany of the wicked, we are reduced to poverty indeed among men, but we\nthereby obtain an increase of true riches with God in heaven; if we are\nbanished from our country, we are more intimately received into the family\nof God; if we meet with vexation and contempt, we are so much the more\nfirmly rooted in Christ; if we are stigmatized with reproach and ignominy,\nwe are so much the more exalted in the kingdom of God; if we are\nmassacred, it opens an entrance for us into a life of blessedness. We\nought to be ashamed of setting a lower estimation on things on which the\nLord has attached such a great value, than on the shadowy and evanescent\npleasures of the present life.\nVIII. Since the Scripture, therefore, by these and similar instructions,\naffords abundant consolation under all the ignominy and calamity which we\nsustain in the defence of righteousness, we are chargeable with extreme\ningratitude if we do not receive them from the hand of the Lord with\ncheerful resignation; especially since this is the species of affliction,\nor the cross, most peculiar to believers, by which Christ will be\nglorified in us, according to the declaration of Peter.(1857) And\ncontumelious treatment being to ingenuous minds more intolerable than a\nhundred deaths, Paul expressly apprizes us, that not only persecutions,\nbut reproaches await us, “because we trust in the living God.”(1858) As in\nanother place he directs us by his example to go through “evil report and\ngood report.”(1859) Nor are we required to exercise such a cheerfulness as\nto banish all sense of bitterness and sorrow; the saints could discover no\npatience under the cross, unless they were tormented with sorrow and\nharassed with grief. If there were no hardship in poverty, no agony in\ndiseases, no distress in ignominy, no horror in death,—what fortitude or\nmoderation would be displayed in regarding them with absolute\nindifference? But since each of these, by its own essential bitterness,\nnaturally preys on all our hearts, herein the fortitude of a believer is\nmanifested, if, when he experiences such bitterness, how grievously soever\nhe may be distressed by it, yet by valiantly resisting, he at length\novercomes it; his patience displays itself, if, when he is sharply\nprovoked, he is nevertheless restrained by the fear of God from any\neruptions of intemperance: his cheerfulness is conspicuous, if, when he is\nwounded by sadness and sorrow, he is satisfied with the spiritual\nconsolation of God.\nIX. This conflict, which believers sustain against the natural emotions of\nsorrow, while they cultivate patience and moderation, Paul has beautifully\ndescribed in the following words: “We are troubled on every side, yet not\ndistressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not\nforsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.”(1860) You see that patiently to\nbear the cross does not consist in an absolute stupefaction and privation\nof all sense of sorrow, according to the foolish description given by the\nancient Stoics of a magnanimous man, as one who, divested of the feelings\nof human nature, is alike unaffected by adverse and prosperous events, by\nsorrowful and joyful ones. And what advantage have they derived from this\nsublime wisdom? They have depicted an image of patience, such as never has\nbeen found, such as never can exist among men; but in their ardour for a\npatience too perfect and precise, they have banished its influence from\nhuman life. At present also among Christians there are modern Stoics, who\nesteem it sinful not only to groan and weep, but even to discover sadness\nand solicitude. These paradoxes generally proceed from idle men, who,\nemploying themselves more in speculation than in action, can produce\nnothing but such paradoxical notions. But we have nothing to do with that\niron‐hearted philosophy, which our Master and Lord has condemned not only\nin words, but even by his own example. For he mourned and wept both for\nhis own calamities and for those of others. Nor did he teach his disciples\na different conduct. “The world,” says he, “shall rejoice, but ye shall\nweep and lament.”(1861) And that no man might pervert it into a crime, he\nhas formally pronounced a blessing on them that mourn;(1862) and no\nwonder. For if all tears be reprobated, what judgment shall we form\nconcerning the Lord himself, from whose body distilled tears of\nblood?(1863) If every terror be stigmatized with the charge of unbelief,\nwhat character shall we attribute to that horror and consternation with\nwhich we read that he was so violently depressed? If all sorrow be\ndispleasing, how can we be pleased with his confessing that his “soul” was\n“sorrowful even unto death?”\nX. I have thought proper to mention these things, in order to preserve\npious minds from despair; that they may not hastily renounce the study of\npatience, because they cannot divest themselves of the natural affection\nof sorrow. This must necessarily be the case with those who degrade\npatience into insensibility, and a man of fortitude and constancy into a\nsenseless block. For the Scripture applauds the saints for their patience,\nwhen they are afflicted with severe calamities, but not broken and\novercome by them; when they are bitterly distressed, but are filled at the\nsame time with spiritual joy; when they are oppressed with anxiety, but\nare revived and exhilarated with Divine consolation. At the same time\nthere is that opposition in their hearts, that the feelings of nature\navoid and dread those things which they experience to be inimical to it;\nbut the affection of piety struggles even through these difficulties to\nobey the Divine will. This opposition the Lord expressed, when he thus\naddressed Peter: “When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and\nwalkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, another shall\ngird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.”(1864) It is not\nprobable that Peter, when he was called to glorify God by his death, was\ndrawn to it with reluctance and resistance; in this case his martyrdom\nwould be entitled to little applause. But however he might submit with the\ngreatest alacrity of heart to the Divine appointment, yet, not having\ndivested himself of human nature, he was distracted by two contrary\ninclinations. For when he contemplated the bloody death he was about to\nundergo, stricken with a dread of it, he would gladly have escaped. On the\ncontrary, when he considered that he was called to it by the Divine will,\nsuppressing all fear, he unreluctantly and even cheerfully submitted to\nit. It must be our study, therefore, if we would be the disciples of\nChrist, that our minds may be imbued with so great a reverence for God,\nand such an unreserved obedience to him, as may overcome all contrary\naffections, and make them submit to his appointments. Thus, whatever kind\nof affliction we endure, even in the greatest distresses of the mind, we\nshall constantly retain our patience. For adversity itself will have its\nstings, with which we shall be wounded. Thus, when afflicted with disease,\nwe shall groan and be disquieted, and pray for the restoration of health;\nthus, when oppressed with poverty, we shall feel the stings of solicitude\nand sorrow; thus we shall be affected with the grief of ignominy,\ncontempt, and injury; thus we shall shed the tears due to nature at the\nfunerals of our friends; but we shall always recur to this conclusion,\nThis affliction is appointed by the Lord, therefore let us submit to his\nwill. Even in the agonies of grief, amid groans and tears, there is a\nnecessity for the intervention of this reflection, in order to incline the\nheart cheerfully to bear those things by which it is so affected.\nXI. But as we have deduced the principal reason for bearing the cross from\na consideration of the Divine will, we must briefly point out the\ndifference between philosophical and Christian patience. For very few of\nthe philosophers have risen to such an eminence of reason, as to perceive\nthat we are exercised with afflictions by the Divine hand, and to conclude\nthat God ought to be obeyed in these occurrences; and even those who have\ngone to this length, adduce no other reason, than because it is necessary.\nWhat is this but saying, that we must submit to God, because it were in\nvain to contend against him? For if we obey God only from necessity, if it\nwere possible to escape from him, our obedience would cease. But the\nScripture enjoins us to consider the Divine will in a very different point\nof view; first, as consistent with justice and equity; secondly, as\ndirected to the accomplishment of our salvation. Christian exhortations to\npatience, then, are such as these: Whether we are afflicted with poverty,\nor exile, or imprisonment, or reproach, or disease, or loss of relatives,\nor any other similar calamity, we must reflect that none of these things\nhappen without the appointment and providence of God; and, moreover, that\nhe does nothing but with the most systematic justice. Do not our\ninnumerable and daily transgressions deserve more severe and grievous\nchastisements than those which his clemency inflicts on us? Is it not\nhighly reasonable that our flesh should be subdued, and as it were\naccustomed to the yoke, lest it should break out, according to its\npropensities, into lawless excesses? Are not the righteousness and truth\nof God worthy of our labours on their account? But if the equity of God\nevidently appears in our afflictions, we cannot without iniquity either\nmurmur or resist. We no longer hear that frigid maxim of the philosophers,\nWe must submit to necessity; but a lesson lively and full of efficacy, We\nmust obey, because it is unlawful to resist: we must patiently suffer,\nbecause impatience is a rebellious opposition to the justice of God.\nBecause nothing is really amiable to us but what we know to be conducive\nto our benefit and salvation, our most merciful Father affords us\nconsolation also in this respect, by declaring, that even in afflicting us\nwith the cross, he promotes our salvation. But if it be evident that\ntribulations are salutary for us, why should we not endure them with\ngrateful and placid hearts? In patiently bearing them, therefore, we do\nnot submit to necessity, but acquiesce in our own benefit. The effect of\nthese considerations is, that in proportion as our minds are oppressed\nunder the cross with the natural sense of affliction, so greatly are they\ndilated with spiritual joy. This is attended also by thanksgiving, which\ncannot be without joy. But if praise and thanksgiving to the Lord can only\nproceed from a cheerful and joyful heart,—and there is nothing which ought\nto repress these emotions within us,—this shows how necessary it is that\nthe bitterness of the cross should be tempered with spiritual joy."

          "title": "Chapter IX. Meditation On The Future Life.",
          "content": "With whatever kind of tribulation we may be afflicted, we should always\nkeep this end in view—to habituate ourselves to a contempt of the present\nlife, that we may thereby be excited to meditation on that which is to\ncome. For the Lord, well knowing our strong natural inclination to a\nbrutish love of the world, adopts a most excellent method to reclaim us\nand rouse us from our insensibility, that we may not be too tenaciously\nattached to that foolish affection. There is not one of us who is not\ndesirous of appearing, through the whole course of his life, to aspire and\nstrive after celestial immortality. For we are ashamed of excelling in no\nrespect the brutal herds, whose condition would not be at all inferior to\nours, unless there remained to us a hope of eternity after death. But if\nyou examine the designs, pursuits, and actions of every individual, you\nwill find nothing in them but what is terrestrial. Hence that stupidity,\nthat the mental eyes, dazzled with the vain splendour of riches, power,\nand honours, cannot see to any considerable distance. The heart also,\noccupied and oppressed with avarice, ambition, and other inordinate\ndesires, cannot rise to any eminence. In a word, the whole soul,\nfascinated by carnal allurements, seeks its felicity on earth. To oppose\nthis evil, the Lord, by continual lessons of miseries, teaches his\nchildren the vanity of the present life. That they may not promise\nthemselves profound and secure peace in it, therefore he permits them to\nbe frequently disquieted and infested with wars or tumults, with robberies\nor other injuries. That they may not aspire with too much avidity after\ntransient and uncertain riches, or depend on those which they\npossess,—sometimes by exile, sometimes by the sterility of the land,\nsometimes by a conflagration, sometimes by other means, he reduces them to\nindigence, or at least confines them within the limits of mediocrity. That\nthey may not be too complacently delighted with conjugal blessings, he\neither causes them to be distressed with the wickedness of their wives, or\nhumbles them with a wicked offspring, or afflicts them with want or loss\nof children. But if in all these things he is more indulgent to them, yet\nthat they may not be inflated with vain glory, or improper confidence, he\nshows them by diseases and dangers the unstable and transitory nature of\nall mortal blessings. We therefore truly derive advantage from the\ndiscipline of the cross, only when we learn that this life, considered in\nitself, is unquiet, turbulent, miserable in numberless instances, and in\nno respect altogether happy; and that all its reputed blessings are\nuncertain, transient, vain, and adulterated with a mixture of many evils;\nand in consequence of this at once conclude, that nothing can be sought or\nexpected on earth but conflict, and that when we think of a crown we must\nraise our eyes towards heaven. For it must be admitted, that the mind is\nnever seriously excited to desire and meditate on the future life, without\nhaving previously imbibed a contempt of the present.\nII. There is no medium between these two extremes; either the earth must\nbecome vile in our estimation, or it must retain our immoderate love.\nWherefore, if we have any concern about eternity, we must use our most\ndiligent efforts to extricate ourselves from these fetters. Now, since the\npresent life has numerous blandishments to attract us, and much pleasure,\nbeauty, and sweetness to delight us,—it is very necessary to our highest\ninterests, that we should be frequently called off, that we may not be\nfascinated with such allurements. For what would be the consequence, if we\nwere perpetually happy in the enjoyment of the blessings of this life;\nsince we cannot, even by the incessant stimulus of calamity after\ncalamity, be sufficiently aroused to a consideration of its misery? That\nhuman life is like a vapour or a shadow, is not only known to the learned,\nbut even the vulgar have no proverb more common; and perceiving it to be a\nthing the knowledge of which would be eminently useful, they have\nrepresented it in many remarkable sentences. But there is scarcely any\nthing which we more carelessly consider, or sooner forget; for we\nundertake every thing as though we were erecting for ourselves an\nimmortality on earth. If a funeral pass by, or we walk among the tombs,\nbecause the image of death is then presented to our eyes, we philosophize,\nI confess, in an admirable manner concerning the vanity of the present\nlife; although even that is not always the case, for frequently we are\nquite unaffected with all these things. But when this effect is produced,\nour philosophy is momentary, vanishing as soon as we withdraw, and leaving\nnot even the smallest vestige behind it; in short, it passes away, and is\nforgotten just like the plaudits of a theatre at any entertaining\nexhibition. And forgetting not only death, but mortality itself, as though\nno rumour concerning it had ever reached us, we relapse into a supine\nsecurity of immortality on earth. If any one, in the mean time, reminds us\nof the unwelcome proverb, that man is a creature of a day, we acknowledge\nthe truth of it indeed, but with such inattention that the idea of\nperpetually living here still remains fixed in our minds. Who, then, can\ndeny, that it is highly useful to us all, I do not say to be admonished by\nwords, but by every possible evidence to be convinced, of the miserable\ncondition of the present life; since even after we are convinced of it, we\nscarcely cease to be besotted with a perverse and foolish admiration of\nit, as though it contained the greatest attainable blessings? But if it be\nnecessary for God to instruct us, it is, on the other hand, our duty to\nlisten to him when he calls, and rebukes our sluggishness; in order that,\ndespising the world, we may apply ourselves with our whole heart to\nmeditate on the life which is to come.\nIII. But believers should accustom themselves to such a contempt of the\npresent life, as may not generate either hatred of life, or ingratitude\ntowards God. For this life, though it is replete with innumerable\nmiseries, is yet deservedly reckoned among the Divine blessings which must\nnot be despised. Wherefore, if we discover nothing of the Divine\nbeneficence in it, we are already guilty of no small ingratitude towards\nGod himself. But to believers especially it should be a testimony of the\nDivine benevolence, since the whole of it is destined to the advancement\nof their salvation. For before he openly discovers to us the inheritance\nof eternal glory, he intends to reveal himself as our Father in inferior\ninstances; and those are the benefits which he daily confers on us. Since\nthis life, then, is subservient to a knowledge of the Divine goodness,\nshall we fastidiously scorn it, as though it contained no particle of\ngoodness in it? We must therefore have this sense and affection, to class\nit among the bounties of the Divine benignity which are not to be\nrejected. For if Scripture testimonies were wanting, which are very\nnumerous and clear, even nature itself exhorts us to give thanks to the\nLord for having introduced us to the light of life, for granting us the\nuse of it, and giving us all the helps necessary to its preservation. And\nit is a far superior reason for gratitude, if we consider that here we are\nin some measure prepared for the glory of the heavenly kingdom. For the\nLord has ordained, that they who are to be hereafter crowned in heaven,\nmust first engage in conflicts on earth, that they may not triumph without\nhaving surmounted the difficulties of warfare and obtained the victory.\nAnother reason is, that here we begin in various blessings to taste the\nsweetness of the Divine benignity, that our hope and desire may be excited\nafter the full revelation of it. When we have come to this conclusion,\nthat our life in this world is a gift of the Divine clemency, which, as we\nowe to him, we ought to remember with gratitude, it will then be time for\nus to descend to a consideration of its most miserable condition, that we\nmay be delivered from excessive love of it, to which, as has been\nobserved, we are naturally inclined.\nIV. Now, whatever is abstracted from the corrupt love of this life should\nbe added to the desire of a better. I grant, indeed, the correctness of\ntheir opinion, who considered it as the greatest blessing not to be born,\nand as the next, to die immediately. For, being heathens, destitute of the\nknowledge of God and of true religion, what could they see in it but\nunhappiness and misery? Nor was there any thing irrational in the conduct\nof those who mourned and wept at the births of their relations, and\nsolemnly rejoiced at their funerals. But they practised this without any\nadvantage; for, destitute of the true doctrine of faith, they did not\nperceive how that can conduce to the benefit of the pious, which in itself\nis neither blessed nor desirable; and so their views terminated in\ndespair. It should be the object of believers, therefore, in judging of\nthis mortal life, that understanding it to be of itself nothing but\nmisery, they may apply themselves wholly, with increasing cheerfulness and\nreadiness, to meditate on the future and eternal life. When we come to\nthis comparison, then indeed the former may be not only securely\nneglected, but, in competition with the latter, altogether despised and\nabhorred. For if heaven is our country, what is the earth but a place of\nexile? If the departure out of the world is an entrance into life, what is\nthe world but a sepulchre? What is a continuance in it but an absorption\nin death? If deliverance from the body is an introduction into complete\nliberty, what is the body but a prison? If to enjoy the presence of God is\nthe summit of felicity, is it not misery to be destitute of it? But till\nwe escape out of the world, “we are absent from the Lord.”(1865)\nTherefore, if the terrestrial life be compared with the celestial, it\nshould undoubtedly be despised and accounted of no value. It certainly is\nnever to be hated, except in as much as it keeps us obnoxious to sin;\nalthough even that hatred is not properly to be applied to life itself. It\nbecomes us, however, to be so affected with weariness or hatred of it, as\nto desire its end, but to be also prepared to remain in it during the\nDivine pleasure; that is to say, our weariness should be remote from all\nmurmuring and impatience. For it is a post at which the Lord has placed\nus, to be retained by us till he call us away. Paul, indeed, bewails his\nlot, that he is kept in bondage by the fetters of the body longer than he\nwould wish, and sighs with an ardent desire of deliverance;(1866)\nnevertheless, obedient to the Divine authority, he professes himself\nprepared for both; for he acknowledges himself under an obligation to God\nto glorify his name either by life or by death;(1867) but that it belongs\nto the Lord to determine what will conduce most to his glory. Therefore,\nif it becomes us “to live and to die to the Lord,”(1868) let us leave the\nlimits of our life and death to his decision; yet in such a manner, as\nardently to desire and continually to meditate on the latter, but to\ndespise the former in comparison with future immortality, and on account\nof the servitude of sin, to wish to forsake it whenever it shall please\nthe Lord.\nV. But it is monstrous, that instead of this desire of death, multitudes\nwho boast themselves to be Christians, are filled with such a dread of it,\nthat they tremble whenever it is mentioned, as if it were the greatest\ncalamity that could befall them. It is no wonder, indeed, if our natural\nfeelings should be alarmed at hearing of our dissolution. But it is\nintolerable that there should not be in a Christian breast sufficient\nlight of piety to overcome and suppress all that fear with superior\nconsolation. For if we consider, that this unstable, depraved,\ncorruptible, frail, withering, and rotten tabernacle of our body is\ndissolved, in order that it may hereafter be restored to a durable,\nperfect, incorruptible, and heavenly glory,—will not faith constrain us\nardently to desire what nature dreads? If we consider, that by death we\nare recalled from exile to inhabit our own country, and that a heavenly\none, shall we derive thence no consolation? But it will be said, There is\nnothing that does not desire to be permanent. I admit it; and contend that\nwe ought therefore to direct our views to a future immortality, where we\nmay obtain a fixed condition, which is nowhere to be found on earth. For\nPaul excellently teaches believers to go with alacrity to death, “not for\nthat they would be unclothed, but clothed upon.”(1869) Shall brute\nanimals, and even inanimate creatures, down to stocks and stones,\nconscious of their present vanity, be looking forward to the resurrection\nat the last day, that they may be delivered from vanity, together with the\nchildren of God; and shall we, endued with the light of understanding,\nand, what is superior to the natural understanding, illuminated with the\nSpirit of God, when the question respects our own existence, not raise our\nminds above the corruption of this world? But it is not necessary to my\npresent design, nor suitable in this place, to argue against such extreme\nperverseness. And I have already declared in the beginning, that I would\nnot undertake a diffuse discussion of commonplace topics. I would persuade\nsuch timid minds to read Cyprian’s treatise on Mortality, did they not\ndeserve rather to be referred to the philosophers, that they may begin to\nblush, when they see the contempt of death discovered by them. But this we\nmay positively conclude, that no man has made any good proficiency in the\nschool of Christ, but he who joyfully expects both the day of death and\nthat of the final resurrection. For Paul describes all believers by this\ncharacter,(1870) and the Scripture often recalls our attention to it, when\nit intends to furnish us with a reason for true joy. “Look up,” saith the\nLord, “and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.”(1871) Is\nit reasonable, that what he designed so powerfully to excite us to\nexultation and alacrity, should produce nothing but sorrow and\nconsternation? If this be the case, why do we still glory in him as our\nMaster? Let us therefore acquire a sounder judgment; and notwithstanding\nthe opposition of the blind and stupid cupidity of our flesh, let us not\nhesitate ardently to desire the advent of the Lord, as of all events the\nmost auspicious. For he shall come to us as a Redeemer, to deliver us from\nthis bottomless gulf of all evils and miseries, and introduce us into that\nblessed inheritance of his life and glory.\nVI. It is certainly true, that the whole family of believers, as long as\nthey dwell on the earth, must be “accounted as sheep for the\nslaughter,”(1872) that they may be conformed to Christ their Head. Their\nstate, therefore, would be extremely deplorable, if they did not elevate\ntheir thoughts towards heaven, rise above all sublunary things, and look\nbeyond present appearances.(1873) On the contrary, when they have once\nraised their heads above this world, although they see the impious\nflourishing in riches and honours, and enjoying the most profound\ntranquillity; though they see them boasting of their splendour and luxury,\nand behold them abounding in every delight; though they may also be\nharassed by their wickedness, insulted by their pride, defrauded by their\navarice, and may receive from them any other lawless provocations,—yet\nthey will find no difficulty in supporting themselves even under such\ncalamities as these. For they will keep in view that day when the Lord\nwill receive his faithful servants into his peaceful kingdom; will wipe\nevery tear from their eyes,(1874) invest them with robes of joy, adorn\nthem with crowns of glory, entertain them with his ineffable delights,\nexalt them to fellowship with his majesty, and, in a word, honour them\nwith a participation of his happiness. But the impious, who have been\ngreat in this world, he will precipitate down to the lowest ignominy; he\nwill change their delights into torments, and their laughter and mirth\ninto weeping and gnashing of teeth; he will disturb their tranquillity\nwith dreadful agonies of conscience, and will punish their delicacy with\ninextinguishable fire, and even put them in subjection to the pious, whose\npatience they have abused. For, according to Paul, “it is a righteous\nthing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble” the saints,\n“and to” them “who are troubled, rest, when the Lord Jesus shall be\nrevealed from heaven.”(1875) This is our only consolation; and deprived of\nthis, we must of necessity either sink into despondency of mind, or solace\nourselves to our own destruction with the vain pleasures of the world. For\neven the Psalmist confesses that he staggered,(1876) when he was too much\nengaged in contemplating the present prosperity of the impious; and that\nhe could no otherwise establish himself, till he entered the sanctuary of\nGod, and directed his views to the last end of the godly and of the\nwicked. To conclude in one word, the cross of Christ triumphs, in the\nhearts of believers, over the devil and the flesh, over sin and impious\nmen, only when their eyes are directed to the power of the resurrection."

          "title": "Chapter X. The Right Use Of The Present Life And Its Supports.",
          "content": "By such principles, the Scripture also fully instructs us in the right use\nof terrestrial blessings—a thing that ought not to be neglected in a plan\nfor the regulation of life. For if we must live, we must also use the\nnecessary supports of life; nor can we avoid even those things which\nappear to subserve our pleasures rather than our necessities. It behooves\nus, therefore, to observe moderation, that we may use them with a pure\nconscience, whether for necessity or for pleasure. This the Lord\nprescribes in his word, when he teaches us, that to his servants the\npresent life is like a pilgrimage, in which they are travelling towards\nthe celestial kingdom. If we are only to pass through the earth, we ought\nundoubtedly to make such a use of its blessings as will rather assist than\nretard us in our journey. It is not without reason, therefore, that Paul\nadvises us to use this world as though we used it not, and to buy with the\nsame disposition with which we sell.(1877) But as this is a difficult\nsubject, and there is danger of falling into one of two opposite errors,\nlet us endeavour to proceed on safe ground, that we may avoid both\nextremes. For there have been some, in other respects good and holy men,\nwho, seeing that intemperance and luxury, unless restrained with more than\nordinary severity, would perpetually indulge the most extravagant\nexcesses, and desiring to correct such a pernicious evil, have adopted the\nonly method which occurred to them, by permitting men to use corporeal\nblessings no further than their necessity should absolutely require. This\nadvice was well intended, but they were far too austere. For they\ncommitted the very dangerous error of imposing on the conscience stricter\nrules than those which are prescribed to it by the word of the Lord. By\nrestriction within the demands of necessity, they meant an abstinence from\nevery thing from which it is possible to abstain; so that, according to\nthem, it would scarcely be lawful to eat or drink any thing but bread and\nwater. Others have discovered still greater austerity, like Crates the\nTheban, who is said to have thrown his wealth into the sea, from an\napprehension that, unless it were destroyed, he should himself be\ndestroyed by it. On the contrary, many in the present day, who seek a\npretext to excuse intemperance in the use of external things, and at the\nsame time desire to indulge the licentiousness of the flesh, assume as\ngranted, what I by no means concede to them, that this liberty is not to\nbe restricted by any limitation; but that it ought to be left to the\nconscience of every individual to use as much as he thinks lawful for\nhimself. I grant, indeed, that it is neither right nor possible to bind\nthe conscience with the fixed and precise rules of law in this case; but\nsince the Scripture delivers general rules for the lawful use of earthly\nthings, our practice ought certainly to be regulated by them.\nII. It must be laid down as a principle, that the use of the gifts of God\nis not erroneous, when it is directed to the same end for which the\nCreator himself has created and appointed them for us; since he has\ncreated them for our benefit, not for our injury. Wherefore, no one will\nobserve a more proper rule, than he who shall diligently regard this end.\nNow, if we consider for what end he has created the various kinds of\naliment, we shall find that he intended to provide not only for our\nnecessity, but likewise for our pleasure and delight. So in clothing, he\nhas had in view not mere necessity, but propriety and decency. In herbs,\ntrees, and fruits, beside their various uses, his design has been to\ngratify us by graceful forms and pleasant odours. For if this were not\ntrue, the Psalmist would not recount among the Divine blessings, “wine\nthat maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to\nshine;”(1878) nor would the Scriptures universally declare, in\ncommendation of his goodness, that he has given all these things to men.\nAnd even the natural properties of things sufficiently indicate for what\nend, and to what extent, it is lawful to use them. But shall the Lord have\nendued flowers with such beauty, to present itself to our eyes, with such\nsweetness of smell, to impress our sense of smelling; and shall it be\nunlawful for our eyes to be affected with the beautiful sight, or our\nolfactory nerves with the agreeable odour? What! has he not made such a\ndistinction of colours as to render some more agreeable than others? Has\nhe not given to gold and silver, to ivory and marble, a beauty which makes\nthem more precious than other metals or stones? In a word, has he not made\nmany things worthy of our estimation, independently of any necessary use?\nIII. Let us discard, therefore, that inhuman philosophy which, allowing no\nuse of the creatures but what is absolutely necessary, not only\nmalignantly deprives us of the lawful enjoyment of the Divine beneficence,\nbut which cannot be embraced till it has despoiled man of all his senses,\nand reduced him to a senseless block. But, on the other hand, we must,\nwith equal diligence, oppose the licentiousness of the flesh; which,\nunless it be rigidly restrained, transgresses every bound. And, as I have\nobserved, it has its advocates, who, under the pretext of liberty, allow\nit every thing. In the first place, it will be one check to it, if it be\nconcluded, that all things are made for us, in order that we may know and\nacknowledge their Author, and celebrate his goodness towards us by giving\nhim thanks. What will become of thanksgiving, if you overcharge yourself\nwith dainties or wine, so as to be stupefied or rendered unfit for the\nduties of piety and the business of your station? Where is any\nacknowledgment of God, if your body, in consequence of excessive\nabundance, being inflamed with the vilest passions, infects the mind with\nits impurity, so that you cannot discern what is right or virtuous? Where\nis gratitude towards God for clothing, if, on account of our sumptuous\napparel, we admire ourselves and despise others? if with the elegance and\nbeauty of it, we prepare ourselves for unchastity? Where is our\nacknowledgment of God, if our minds be fixed on the splendour of our\ngarments? For many so entirely devote all their senses to the pursuit of\npleasure, that the mind is, as it were, buried in it; many are so\ndelighted with marble, gold, and pictures, that they become like statues,\nare, as it were, metamorphosed into metal, and resemble painted images.\nThe flavour of meats, or the sweetness of odours, so stupefies some, that\nthey have no relish for any thing spiritual. The same may be observed in\nother cases. Wherefore it is evident, that this principle lays some\nrestraint on the license of abusing the Divine bounties, and confirms the\nrule given us by Paul, that we “make not provision for the flesh, to\nfulfil the lusts thereof;”(1879) which, if they are allowed too much\nlatitude, will transgress all the bounds of temperance and moderation.\nIV. But there is no way more certain or concise, than what we derive from\na contempt of the present life, and meditation on a heavenly immortality.\nFor thence follow two rules. The first is, “that they that have wives be\nas though they had none; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;\nand they that use this world, as not abusing it;”(1880) according to the\ndirection of Paul: the second, that we should learn to bear penury with\ntranquillity and patience, as well as to enjoy abundance with moderation.\nHe who commands us to use this world as though we used it not, prohibits\nnot only all intemperance in eating and drinking, and excessive delicacy,\nambition, pride, haughtiness, and fastidiousness in our furniture, our\nhabitations, and our apparel, but every care and affection, which would\neither seduce or disturb us from thoughts of the heavenly life, and\nattention to the improvement of our souls. Now, it was anciently and truly\nobserved by Cato, That there is a great concern about adorning the body,\nand a great carelessness about virtue; and it is an old proverb, That they\nwho are much engaged in the care of the body, are generally negligent of\nthe soul. Therefore, though the liberty of believers in external things\ncannot be reduced to certain rules, yet it is evidently subject to this\nlaw, That they should indulge themselves as little as possible; that, on\nthe contrary, they should perpetually and resolutely exert themselves to\nretrench all superfluities and to restrain luxury; and that they should\ndiligently beware lest they pervert into impediments things which were\ngiven for their assistance.\nV. The other rule will be, That persons whose property is small should\nlearn to be patient under their privations, that they may not be tormented\nwith an immoderate desire of riches. They who observe this moderation,\nhave attained no small proficiency in the school of the Lord, as he who\nhas made no proficiency in this point can scarcely give any proof of his\nbeing a disciple of Christ. For besides that an inordinate desire of\nearthly things is accompanied by most other vices, he who is impatient\nunder penury, in abundance generally betrays the opposite passion. By this\nI mean, that he who is ashamed of a mean garment, will be proud of a\nsplendid one; he who, not content with a slender meal, is disquieted with\nthe desire of a more sumptuous one, would also intemperately abuse those\ndainties, should they fall to his lot; he who bears a private and mean\ncondition with discontent and disquietude, would not abstain from pride\nand arrogance, should he rise to eminence and honours. Let all, therefore,\nwho are sincere in the practice of piety, earnestly endeavour to learn,\nafter the apostolic example, “both to be full and to be hungry, both to\nabound and to suffer need.”(1881) The Scripture has also a third rule, by\nwhich it regulates the use of earthly things; of which something was said,\nwhen we treated of the precepts of charity. For it states, that while all\nthese things are given to us by the Divine goodness, and appointed for our\nbenefit, they are, as it were, deposits intrusted to our care, of which we\nmust one day give an account. We ought, therefore, to manage them in such\na manner that this alarm may be incessantly sounding in our ears, “Give an\naccount of thy stewardship.”(1882) Let it also be remembered by whom this\naccount is demanded; that it is by him who has so highly recommended\nabstinence, sobriety, frugality, and modesty; who abhors profusion, pride,\nostentation, and vanity; who approves of no other management of his\nblessings, than such as is connected with charity; who has with his own\nmouth already condemned all those pleasures which seduce the heart from\nchastity and purity, or tend to impair the understanding.\nVI. Lastly, it is to be remarked, that the Lord commands every one of us,\nin all the actions of life, to regard his vocation. For he knows with what\ngreat inquietude the human mind is inflamed, with what desultory levity it\nis hurried hither and thither, and how insatiable is its ambition to grasp\ndifferent things at once. Therefore, to prevent universal confusion being\nproduced by our folly and temerity, he has appointed to all their\nparticular duties in different spheres of life. And that no one might\nrashly transgress the limits prescribed, he has styled such spheres of\nlife vocations, or callings. Every individual’s line of life, therefore,\nis, as it were, a post assigned him by the Lord, that he may not wander\nabout in uncertainty all his days. And so necessary is this distinction,\nthat in his sight all our actions are estimated according to it, and often\nvery differently from the sentence of human reason and philosophy. There\nis no exploit esteemed more honourable, even among philosophers, than to\ndeliver our country from tyranny; but the voice of the celestial Judge\nopenly condemns the private man who lays violent hands on a tyrant. It is\nnot my design, however, to stay to enumerate examples. It is sufficient if\nwe know that the principle and foundation of right conduct in every case\nis the vocation of the Lord, and that he who disregards it will never keep\nthe right way in the duties of his station. He may sometimes, perhaps,\nachieve something apparently laudable; but however it may appear in the\neyes of men, it will be rejected at the throne of God; besides which,\nthere will be no consistency between the various parts of his life. Our\nlife, therefore, will then be best regulated, when it is directed to this\nmark; since no one will be impelled by his own temerity to attempt more\nthan is compatible with his calling, because he will know that it is\nunlawful to transgress the bounds assigned him. He that is in obscurity\nwill lead a private life without discontent, so as not to desert the\nstation in which God has placed him. It will also be no small alleviation\nof his cares, labours, troubles, and other burdens, when a man knows that\nin all these things he has God for his guide. The magistrate will execute\nhis office with greater pleasure, the father of a family will confine\nhimself to his duty with more satisfaction, and all, in their respective\nspheres of life, will bear and surmount the inconveniences, cares,\ndisappointments, and anxieties which befall them, when they shall be\npersuaded that every individual has his burden laid upon him by God. Hence\nalso will arise peculiar consolation, since there will be no employment so\nmean and sordid (provided we follow our vocation) as not to appear truly\nrespectable, and be deemed highly important in the sight of God."

          "title": "Chapter XI. Justification By Faith. The Name And Thing Defined.",
          "content": "I think I have already explained, with sufficient care, how that men,\nbeing subject to the curse of the law, have no means left of attaining\nsalvation but through faith alone; and also what faith itself is, what\nDivine blessings it confers on man, and what effects it produces in him.\nThe substance of what I have advanced is, that Christ, being given to us\nby the goodness of God, is apprehended and possessed by us by faith, by a\nparticipation of whom we receive especially two benefits. In the first\nplace, being by his innocence reconciled to God, we have in heaven a\npropitious father instead of a judge; in the next place, being sanctified\nby his Spirit, we devote ourselves to innocence and purity of life. Of\nregeneration, which is the second benefit, I have said what I thought was\nsufficient. The method of justification has been but slightly touched,\nbecause it was necessary, first to understand that the faith, by which\nalone we attain gratuitous justification through the Divine mercy, is not\nunattended with good works, and what is the nature of the good works of\nthe saints, in which part of this question consists. The subject of\njustification, therefore, must now be fully discussed, and discussed with\nthe recollection that it is the principal hinge by which religion is\nsupported, in order that we may apply to it with the greater attention and\ncare. For unless we first of all apprehend in what situation we stand with\nrespect to God, and what his judgment is concerning us, we have no\nfoundation either for a certainty of salvation, or for the exercise of\npiety towards God. But the necessity of knowing this subject will be more\nevident from the knowledge itself.\nII. But that we may not stumble at the threshold, (which would be the case\nwere we to enter on a disputation concerning a subject not understood by\nus,) let us first explain the meaning of these expressions. _To be\njustified in the sight of God, To be justified by faith or by works._ He\nis said to be _justified in the sight of God_ who in the Divine judgment\nis reputed righteous, and accepted on account of his righteousness; for as\niniquity is abominable to God, so no sinner can find favour in his sight,\nas a sinner, or so long as he is considered as such. Wherever sin is,\ntherefore, it is accompanied with the wrath and vengeance of God. He is\njustified who is considered not as a sinner, but as a righteous person,\nand on that account stands in safety before the tribunal of God, where all\nsinners are confounded and ruined. As, if an innocent man be brought under\nan accusation before the tribunal of a just judge, when judgment is passed\naccording to his innocence, he is said to be justified or acquitted before\nthe judge, so he is justified before God, who, not being numbered among\nsinners, has God for a witness and asserter of his righteousness. Thus he\nmust be said, therefore, to be _justified by works_, whose life discovers\nsuch purity and holiness, as to deserve the character of righteousness\nbefore the throne of God; or who, by the integrity of his works, can\nanswer and satisfy the divine judgment. On the other hand, he will be\n_justified by faith_, who, being excluded from the righteousness of works,\napprehends by faith the righteousness of Christ, invested in which, he\nappears, in the sight of God, not as a sinner, but as a righteous man.\nThus we simply explain justification to be an acceptance, by which God\nreceives us into his favour, and esteems us as righteous persons; and we\nsay that it consists in the remission of sins and the imputation of the\nrighteousness of Christ.\nIII. For the confirmation of this point there are many plain testimonies\nof Scripture. In the first place, that this is the proper and most usual\nsignification of the word, cannot be denied. But since it would be too\ntedious to collect all the passages and compare them together, let it\nsuffice to have suggested it to the reader; for he will easily observe it\nof himself. I will only produce a few places, where this justification,\nwhich we speak of, is expressly handled. First, where Luke relates that\n“the people that heard Christ justified God;” and where Christ pronounces\nthat “wisdom is justified of all her children.”(1883) _To justify God_, in\nthe former passage, does not signify to confer righteousness, which always\nremains perfect in him, although the whole world endeavour to rob him of\nit; nor, in the latter passage, does _the justifying of wisdom_ denote\nmaking the doctrine of salvation righteous, which is so of itself; but\nboth passages imply an ascription to God and to his doctrine of the praise\nwhich they deserve. Again, when Christ reprehends the Pharisees for\n“justifying themselves,”(1884) he does not mean that they attained\nrighteousness by doing what was right, but that they ostentatiously\nendeavoured to gain the character of righteousness, of which they were\ndestitute. This is better understood by persons who are skilled in the\nHebrew language; which gives the appellation of _sinners_, not only to\nthose who are conscious to themselves of sin, but to persons who fall\nunder a sentence of condemnation. For Bathsheba, when she says, “I and my\nson Solomon shall be counted offenders,” or sinners,(1885) confesses no\ncrime, but complains, that she and her son will be exposed to the disgrace\nof being numbered among condemned criminals. And it appears from the\ncontext, that this word, even in the translation, cannot be understood in\nany other than a relative sense, and that it does not denote the real\ncharacter. But with respect to the present subject, where Paul says, “The\nScripture foresaw that God would justify the heathen through faith,”(1886)\nwhat can we understand, but that God imputes righteousness through faith?\nAgain, when he says that God “justifieth the ungodly which believeth in\nJesus,”(1887) what can be the meaning, but that he delivers him by the\nblessing of faith from the condemnation deserved by his ungodliness? He\nspeaks still more plainly in the conclusion, when he thus exclaims: “Who\nshall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that\njustifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,\nthat is risen again, who also maketh intercession for us.”(1888) For it is\njust as if he had said, Who shall accuse them whom God absolves? Who shall\ncondemn those for whom Christ intercedes? Justification, therefore, is no\nother than an acquittal from guilt of him who was accused, as though his\ninnocence had been proved. Since God, therefore, justifies us through the\nmediation of Christ, he acquits us, not by an admission of our personal\ninnocence, but by an imputation of righteousness; so that we, who are\nunrighteous in ourselves, are considered as righteous in Christ. This is\nthe doctrine preached by Paul in the thirteenth chapter of the Acts:\n“Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; and by him\nall that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be\njustified by the law of Moses.”(1889) We see that after remission of sins,\nthis justification is mentioned, as if by way of explanation: we see\nclearly that it means an acquittal; that it is separated from the works of\nthe law; that it is a mere favour of Christ; that it is apprehended by\nfaith: we see, finally, the interposition of a satisfaction, when he says\nthat we are justified from sins by Christ. Thus, when it is said, that the\npublican “went down to his house justified,”(1890) we cannot say that he\nobtained righteousness by any merit of works. The meaning therefore is,\nthat after he had obtained the pardon of his sins, he was considered as\nrighteous in the sight of God. He was righteous, therefore, not through\nany approbation of his works, but through God’s gracious absolution.\nWherefore Ambrose beautifully styles confession of sins, a legitimate\njustification.\nIV. But leaving all contention about the term, if we attend to the thing\nitself, as it is described to us, every doubt will be removed. For Paul\ncertainly describes justification as an acceptance, when he says to the\nEphesians, “God hath predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus\nChrist to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the\npraise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted.”(1891)\nThe meaning of this passage is the same as when in another place we are\nsaid to be “justified freely by his grace.”(1892) But in the fourth\nchapter to the Romans, he first mentions an imputation of righteousness,\nand immediately represents it as consisting in remission of sins. “David,”\nsays he, “describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth\nrighteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are\nforgiven,” &c.(1893) He there, indeed, argues not concerning a branch, but\nthe whole of justification. He also adduces the definition of it given by\nDavid, when he pronounces them to be blessed who receive the free\nforgiveness of their sins; whence it appears, that this righteousness of\nwhich he speaks is simply opposed to guilt. But the most decisive passage\nof all on this point, is where he teaches us that the grand object of the\nministry of the gospel is, that we may “be reconciled to God,” because he\nis pleased to receive us into his favour through Christ, “not imputing”\nour “trespasses unto” us.(1894) Let the reader carefully examine the whole\ncontext; for when, by way of explanation, he just after adds, in order to\ndescribe the method of reconciliation, that Christ, “who knew no sin,” was\n“made sin for us,”(1895) he undoubtedly means by the term\n“reconciliation,” no other than justification. Nor would there be any\ntruth in what he affirms in another place, that we are “made righteous by\nthe obedience of Christ,”(1896) unless we are reputed righteous before\nGod, in him, and out of ourselves.\nV. But since Osiander has introduced I know not what monstrous notion of\nessential righteousness, by which, though he had no intention to destroy\njustification by grace, yet he has involved it in such obscurity as\ndarkens pious minds, and deprives them of a serious sense of the grace of\nChrist,—it will be worth while, before I pass to any thing else, to refute\nthis idle notion. In the first place, this speculation is the mere fruit\nof insatiable curiosity. He accumulates, indeed, many testimonies of\nScripture, to prove that Christ is one with us, and we one with him, of\nwhich there is no proof necessary; but for want of observing the bond of\nthis union, he bewilders himself. For us, however, who hold that we are\nunited to Christ by the secret energy of his Spirit, it will be easy to\nobviate all his sophisms. He had conceived a notion similar to what was\nheld by the Manichæans, so that he wished to transfuse the Divine essence\ninto men. Hence another discovery of his, that Adam was formed in the\nimage of God, because, even antecedently to the fall, Christ had been\nappointed the exemplar of the human nature. But for the sake of brevity, I\nshall only insist on the subject now before us. He says that we are one\nwith Christ. This we admit; but we at the same time deny that Christ’s\nessence is blended with ours. In the next place, we assert that this\nprinciple—that Christ is our righteousness because he is the eternal God,\nthe fountain of righteousness, and the essential righteousness of God—is\ngrossly perverted to support his fallacies. The reader will excuse me, if\nI now just hint at these things, which the order of the treatise requires\nto be deferred to another place. But though he alleges, in vindication of\nhimself, that by the term _essential righteousness_ he only intends to\noppose the opinion that we are reputed righteous for the sake of Christ,\nyet he manifestly shows, that, not content with that righteousness which\nhas been procured for us by the obedience and sacrificial death of Christ,\nhe imagines that we are substantially righteous in God, by the infusion of\nhis essence as well as his character. For this is the reason why he so\nvehemently contends, that not only Christ, but the Father and the Holy\nSpirit also dwell in us; which, though I allow it to be a truth, yet I\nmaintain that he has grossly perverted. For he ought to have fully\nconsidered the nature of this inhabitation; namely, that the Father and\nthe Spirit are in Christ; and that as “all the fulness of the Godhead\ndwelleth in him,”(1897) so in him we possess the whole Deity. Whatever,\ntherefore, he advances concerning the Father and the Spirit separately,\nhas no other tendency but to seduce the simple from Christ. In the next\nplace, he introduces a mixture of substances, by which God, transfusing\nhimself into us, makes us, as it were, a part of himself. For he considers\nit as of no importance, that the power of the Holy Spirit unites us to\nChrist, so that he becomes our head and we become his members, unless his\nessence be blended with ours. But when speaking of the Father and the\nSpirit, he more openly betrays his opinion; which is, that we are not\njustified by the sole grace of the Mediator, and that righteousness is not\nsimply or really offered to us in his person; but that we are made\npartakers of the Divine righteousness when God is essentially united with\nus.\nVI. If he had only said, that Christ in justifying us becomes ours by an\nessential union, and that he is our head not only as man, but that the\nessence of his Divine nature also is infused into us,—he might have\nentertained himself with his fancies with less mischief, nor perhaps would\nso great a contention have been excited about this reverie. But as this\nprinciple is like a cuttlefish, which, by the emission of black and turbid\nblood, conceals its many tails, there is a necessity for a vigorous\nopposition to it, unless we mean to submit to be openly robbed of that\nrighteousness which alone affords us any confidence concerning our\nsalvation. For throughout this discussion, the terms _righteousness_ and\n_justify_ are extended by him to two things. First, he understands that\n“to be justified” denotes not only to be reconciled to God by a free\npardon, but also to be made righteous; and that righteousness is not a\ngratuitous imputation, but a sanctity and integrity inspired by the Divine\nessence which resides in us. Secondly, he resolutely denies that Christ is\nour righteousness, as having, in the character of a priest, expiated our\nsins and appeased the Father on our behalf, but as being the eternal God\nand everlasting life. To prove the first assertion, that God justifies not\nonly by pardoning, but also by regenerating, he inquires whether God\nleaves those whom he justifies in their natural state, without any\nreformation of their manners. The answer is very easy; as Christ cannot be\ndivided, so these two blessings, which we receive together in him, are\nalso inseparable. Whomsoever, therefore, God receives into his favour, he\nlikewise gives them the Spirit of adoption, by whose power he renews them\nin his own image. But if the brightness of the sun be inseparable from his\nheat, shall we therefore say that the earth is warmed by his light, and\nilluminated by his heat? Nothing can be more apposite to the present\nsubject than this similitude. The beams of the sun quicken and fertilize\nthe earth, his rays brighten and illuminate it. Here is a mutual and\nindivisible connection. Yet reason itself prohibits us to transfer to one\nwhat is peculiar to the other. In this confusion of two blessings which\nOsiander obtrudes on us, there is a similar absurdity. For as God actually\nrenews to the practice of righteousness those whom he gratuitously accepts\nas righteous, Osiander confounds that gift of regeneration with this\ngracious acceptance, and contends that they are one and the same. But the\nScripture, though it connects them together, yet enumerates them\ndistinctly, that the manifold grace of God may be the more evident to us.\nFor that passage of Paul is not superfluous, that “Christ is made unto us\nrighteousness and sanctification.”(1898) And whenever he argues, from the\nsalvation procured for us, from the paternal love of God, and from the\ngrace of Christ, that we are called to holiness and purity, he plainly\nindicates that it is one thing to be justified, and another thing to be\nmade new creatures. When Osiander appeals to the Scripture, he corrupts as\nmany passages as he cites. The assertion of Paul, that “to him that\nworketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith\nis counted for righteousness,”(1899) is explained by Osiander to denote\nmaking a man righteous. With the same temerity he corrupts the whole of\nthat fourth chapter to the Romans, and hesitates not to impose the same\nfalse gloss on the passage just cited, “Who shall lay any thing to the\ncharge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth;” where it is evident\nthat the apostle is treating simply of accusation and absolution, and that\nhis meaning wholly rests on the antithesis. His folly, therefore, betrays\nitself both in his arguments and in his citations of Scripture proofs.\nWith no more propriety does he treat of the word righteousness, when he\nsays, “that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness,” because that\nafter having embraced Christ, (who is the righteousness of God, and God\nhimself,) he was eminent for the greatest virtues. Whence it appears, that\nof two good parts, he erroneously makes one corrupt whole; for the\nrighteousness there mentioned does not belong to the whole course of\nAbraham’s life; but rather the Spirit testifies that, notwithstanding the\nsingular eminence of Abraham’s virtues, and his laudable and persevering\nadvancement in them, yet he did not please God any otherwise than in\nreceiving by faith the grace offered in the promise. Whence it follows,\nthat in justification there is no regard paid to works, as Paul\nconclusively argues in that passage.\nVII. His objection, that the power of justifying belongs not to faith of\nitself, but only as it receives Christ, I readily admit. For if faith were\nto justify of itself, or by an intrinsic efficacy, as it is expressed,\nbeing always weak and imperfect, it never could effect this but in part;\nand thus it would be a defective justification, which would only confer on\nus a partial salvation. Now, we entertain no such notion as the objection\nsupposes; on the contrary, we affirm that, strictly speaking, “it is God\nthat justifies;” and then we transfer this to Christ, because he is given\nto us for righteousness. Faith we compare to a vessel; for unless we come\nempty with the mouth of our soul open to implore the grace of Christ, we\ncannot receive Christ. Whence it may be inferred, that we do not detract\nfrom Christ the power of justifying, when we teach that faith receives him\nbefore it receives his righteousness. Nevertheless, I cannot admit the\nintricate comparisons of this sophist, when he says that faith is Christ;\nas though an earthen vessel were a treasure, because gold is concealed in\nit. For faith, although intrinsically it is of no dignity or value,\njustifies us by an application of Christ, just as a vessel full of money\nconstitutes a man rich. Therefore I maintain that faith, which is only the\ninstrument by which righteousness is received, cannot without absurdity be\nconfounded with Christ, who is the material cause, and at once the author\nand dispenser of so great a benefit. We have now removed the difficulty as\nto the sense in which the word _faith_ ought to be understood, when it is\napplied to justification.\nVIII. Respecting the reception of Christ, he goes still greater lengths;\nasserting that the internal word is received by the ministry of the\nexternal word, by which he would divert us from the priesthood of Christ\nand the person of the Mediator, to his eternal divinity. We do not divide\nChrist, but we maintain that the same person, who, by reconciling us to\nthe Father in his own flesh, has given us righteousness, is the eternal\nWord of God; and we confess that he could not otherwise have discharged\nthe office of Mediator, and procured righteousness for us, if he were not\nthe eternal God. But the opinion of Osiander is, that since Christ is both\nGod and man, he is made righteousness to us, in respect of his Divine, not\nhis human nature. Now, if this properly belong to the Divinity, it will\nnot be peculiar to Christ, but common also to the Father and the Spirit;\nsince the righteousness of one is the same as that of the others. Besides,\nwhat has been naturally eternal, cannot with propriety be said to be “made\nunto us.” But though we grant that God is made righteousness unto us, how\nwill it agree with the clause which is inserted, that “of God,” he “is\nmade unto us righteousness?” This is certainly peculiar to the character\nof the Mediator, who, though he contains in himself the Divine nature, yet\nis designated by this appropriate title, by which he is distinguished from\nthe Father and the Spirit. But he ridiculously triumphs in that single\nexpression of Jeremiah, where he promises that “the Lord,” _Jehovah_, will\nbe “our righteousness.”(1900) He can deduce nothing from this, but that\nChrist, who is our righteousness, is God manifested in the flesh. We have\nelsewhere recited from Paul’s sermon, that “God hath purchased the Church\nwith his own blood.”(1901) If any should infer from this, that the blood\nby which our sins were expiated, was Divine, and part of the Divine\nnature, who could bear so monstrous an error? But Osiander thinks he has\ngained every thing by this very puerile cavil; he swells, exults, and\nfills many pages with his swelling words, though the passage is simply and\nreadily explained, by saying that Jehovah, when he should become the seed\nof David, would be the righteousness of the pious; and in the same sense\nIsaiah informs us, “by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify\nmany.”(1902) Let us remark, that the speaker here is the Father; that he\nattributes to his Son the office of justifying; that he adds as a reason,\nthat he is righteous; and that he places the mode or means of effecting\nthis, in the doctrine by which Christ is made known. For it is more\nsuitable to understand the word דעת in a passive sense. Hence I conclude,\nfirst, that Christ was made righteousness when he assumed the form of a\nservant; secondly, that he justifies us by his own obedience to the\nFather; and, therefore, that he does this for us, not according to his\nDivine nature, but by reason of the dispensation committed to him. For\nthough God alone is the fountain of righteousness, and we are righteous\nonly by a participation of him, yet, because we have been alienated from\nhis righteousness through the unhappy breach occasioned by the fall, we\nare under the necessity of descending to this inferior remedy, to be\njustified by Christ, by the efficacy of his death and resurrection.\nIX. If Osiander object, that the excellence of this work surpasses the\nnature of man, and therefore can be ascribed only to the Divine\nnature,—the former part of the objection I admit, but in the latter I\nmaintain that he is grossly mistaken. For although Christ could neither\npurify our souls with his blood, nor appease the Father by his sacrifice,\nnor absolve us from guilt, nor, in short, perform the functions of a\npriest, if he were not truly God, because human power would have been\nunequal to so great a burden, yet it is certain that he performed all\nthese things in his human nature. For if it be inquired, How are we\njustified? Paul replies, “By the obedience” of Christ.(1903) But has he\nobeyed in any other way than by assuming the form of a servant? Hence we\ninfer, that righteousness is presented to us in his flesh. In the other\npassage also, which I much wonder that Osiander is not ashamed to quote so\nfrequently, Paul places the source of righteousness wholly in the humanity\nof Christ. “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we\nmight be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1904) Osiander lays great\nstress on “the righteousness of God,” and triumphs as though he had\nevinced it to be his notion of essential righteousness; whereas the words\nconvey a very different idea,—that we are righteous through the expiation\neffected by Christ. That “the righteousness of God” means that which God\napproves, ought to have been known to the youngest novices; just as in\nJohn “the praise of God” is opposed to “the praise of men.”(1905) I know\nthat “the righteousness of God” sometimes denotes that of which he is the\nauthor, and which he bestows upon us; but, without any observation of\nmine, the judicious reader will perceive that the meaning of this passage\nis only, that we stand before the tribunal of God supported by the atoning\ndeath of Christ. Nor is the term of such great importance, provided that\nOsiander coincides with us in this, that we are justified in Christ,\ninasmuch as he was made an expiatory sacrifice for us; which is altogether\nincompatible with his Divine nature. For this reason, when Christ designs\nto seal the righteousness and salvation which he has presented to us, he\nexhibits a certain pledge of it in his flesh. He calls himself, indeed,\n“living bread;” but adds, by way of explanation, “my flesh is meat indeed,\nand my blood is drink indeed.” This method of instruction is discovered in\nthe sacraments; which, although they direct our faith to the whole of the\nperson of Christ, not to a part of him only, yet at the same time teach\nthat the matter of justification and salvation resides in his human\nnature; not that he either justifies or vivifies, of himself as a mere\nman, but because it has pleased God to manifest in the Mediator that which\nwas incomprehensible and hidden in himself. Wherefore I am accustomed to\nsay, that Christ is, as it were, a fountain opened to us, whence we may\ndraw what were otherwise concealed and useless in that secret and deep\nfountain which flows to us in the person of the Mediator. In this manner,\nand in this sense, provided he will submit to the clear and forcible\narguments which I have adduced, I do not deny that Christ justifies us, as\nhe is God and man, and that this work is common also to the Father and the\nSpirit; and, finally, that the righteousness of which Christ makes us\npartakers, is the eternal righteousness of the eternal God.\nX. Moreover, that his cavils may not deceive the inexperienced, I confess\nthat we are destitute of this incomparable blessing, till Christ becomes\nours. I attribute, therefore, the highest importance to the connection\nbetween the head and members; to the inhabitation of Christ in our hearts;\nin a word, to the mystical union by which we enjoy him, so that being made\nours, he makes us partakers of the blessings with which he is furnished.\nWe do not, then, contemplate him at a distance out of ourselves, that his\nrighteousness may be imputed to us; but because we have put him on, and\nare ingrafted into his body, and because he has deigned to unite us to\nhimself, therefore we glory in a participation of his righteousness. Thus\nwe refute the cavil of Osiander, that faith is considered by us as\nrighteousness; as though we despoiled Christ of his right, when we affirm,\nthat by faith we come to him empty, that he alone may fill us with his\ngrace. But Osiander, despising this spiritual connection, insists on a\ngross mixture of Christ with believers; and therefore invidiously gives\nthe appellation of Zuinglians to all who do not subscribe to his fanatical\nerror concerning essential righteousness; because they are not of opinion\nthat Christ is substantially eaten in the sacred supper. As for myself,\nindeed, I consider it the highest honour to be thus reproached by a man so\nproud and so absorbed in his own delusions; although he attacks not me\nalone, but other writers well known in the world, whom he ought to have\ntreated with modest respect. But this does not at all affect me, who am\nsupporting no private interest; wherefore I the more unreservedly advocate\nthis cause, conscious that I am free from every sinister motive. His great\nimportunity in insisting on essential righteousness, and an essential\ninhabitation of Christ in us, goes to this length—first, that God\ntransfuses himself into us by a gross mixture of himself with us, as he\npretends that there is a carnal eating in the sacred supper; secondly,\nthat God inspires his righteousness into us, by which we are really\nrighteous with him, since, according to this man, such righteousness is as\nreally God himself, as the goodness, or holiness, or perfection of God. I\nshall not take much trouble to refute the testimonies adduced by him,\nwhich he violently perverts from the celestial to the present state. By\nChrist, says Peter, “are given unto us exceeding great and precious\npromises; that by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature.”(1906)\nAs though we were now such as the gospel promises we shall be at the\nsecond advent of Christ; nay, John apprizes us, that _then_ “we shall be\nlike God; for we shall see him as he is.”(1907) I have thought proper to\ngive the reader only a small specimen, and endeavoured to pass over these\nimpertinences, not that it is difficult to refute them, but because I am\nunwilling to be tedious in labouring to no purpose.\nXI. There is yet more latent poison in the second particular, in which he\nmaintains, that we are righteous together with God. I think I have already\nsufficiently demonstrated, that although this dogma were not so\npestiferous, yet because it is weak and unsatisfactory, and evaporates\nthrough its own inanity, it ought justly to be rejected by all judicious\nand pious readers. But this is an impiety not to be tolerated—under the\npretext of a twofold righteousness to weaken the assurance of salvation,\nand to elevate us above the clouds, that we may not embrace by faith the\ngrace of expiation, and call upon God with tranquillity of mind. Osiander\nridicules those who say that justification is a forensic term, because it\nis necessary for us to be actually righteous: nor is there any thing that\nhe more dislikes than the doctrine that we are justified by gratuitous\nimputation. Now, if God do not justify by absolving and pardoning us, what\nis the meaning of this declaration of Paul? “God was in Christ,\nreconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto\nthem. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we\nmight be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1908) First I find, that\nthey are accounted righteous who are reconciled to God: the manner is\nspecified, that God justifies by pardoning; just as, in another passage,\njustification is opposed to accusation; which antithesis clearly\ndemonstrates, that the form of expression is borrowed from the practice of\ncourts. Nor is there any one, but tolerably versed in the Hebrew language,\nprovided at the same time that he be in his sound senses, who can be\nignorant that this is the original of the phrase, and that this is its\nimport and meaning. Now, let Osiander answer me whether, where Paul says\nthat “David describeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are\nthey whose iniquities are forgiven,”(1909) whether, I say, this be a\ncomplete definition or a partial one. Certainly Paul does not adduce the\ntestimony of the Psalmist, as teaching that pardon of sins is a part of\nrighteousness, or concurs to the justification of a man; but he includes\nthe whole of righteousness in a free remission, pronouncing, “Blessed are\nthey whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is\nthe man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.” He thence estimates and\njudges of the felicity of such a man, because in this way he becomes\nrighteous, not actually, but by imputation. Osiander objects, that it\nwould be dishonourable to God, and contrary to his nature, if he justified\nthose who still remain actually impious. But it should be remembered that,\nas I have already observed, the grace of justification is inseparable from\nregeneration, although they are distinct things. But since it is\nsufficiently known from experience, that some relics of sin always remain\nin the righteous, the manner of their justification must of necessity be\nvery different from that of their renovation to newness of life. For the\nlatter God commences in his elect, and as long as they live carries it on\ngradually, and sometimes slowly, so that they are always obnoxious at his\ntribunal to the sentence of death. He justifies them, however, not in a\npartial manner, but so completely, that they may boldly appear in heaven,\nas being invested with the purity of Christ. For no portion of\nrighteousness could satisfy our consciences, till we have ascertained that\nGod is pleased with us, as being unexceptionably righteous before him.\nWhence it follows, that the doctrine of justification is perverted and\ntotally overturned, when doubts are injected into the mind, when the\nconfidence of salvation is shaken, when bold and fearless worship is\ninterrupted, and when quiet and tranquillity with spiritual joy are not\nestablished. Whence Paul argues from the incompatibility of things\ncontrary to each other, that the inheritance is not of the law, because\nthen faith would be rendered vain;(1910) which, if it be fixed upon works,\nmust inevitably fall; since not even the most holy of all saints will find\nthem afford any ground of confidence. This difference between\njustification and regeneration (which Osiander confounds together, and\ndenominates a twofold righteousness) is beautifully expressed by Paul;\nfor, speaking of his real righteousness, or of the integrity which he\npossessed, to which Osiander gives the appellation of essential\nrighteousness, he sorrowfully exclaims, “O wretched man that I am! who\nshall deliver me from the body of this death?”(1911) But resorting to the\nrighteousness which is founded in the Divine mercy alone, he nobly\ntriumphs over life, and death, and reproaches, and famine, and the sword,\nand all adverse things and persons. “Who shall lay any thing to the charge\nof God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. For I am persuaded, that\nnothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in\nChrist Jesus our Lord.”(1912) He plainly declares himself to be possessed\nof that righteousness, which alone is fully sufficient for salvation in\nthe sight of God; so that the miserable servitude, in a consciousness of\nwhich he was just before bewailing his condition, neither diminishes, nor\nin the smallest degree interrupts, the confidence with which he triumphs.\nThis diversity is sufficiently known, and is even familiar to all the\nsaints, who groan under the burden of their iniquities, and yet with\nvictorious confidence rise superior to every fear. But the objection of\nOsiander, that it is incongruous to the nature of God, recoils upon\nhimself; for, although he invests the saints with a twofold righteousness,\nas with a garment covered with skins, he is, notwithstanding, constrained\nto acknowledge that no man can please God without the remission of his\nsins. If this be true, he should at least grant that they who are not\nactually righteous, are accounted righteous in proportion, as it is\nexpressed, to the degree of imputation. But how far shall a sinner extend\nthis gracious acceptance, which is substituted in the place of\nrighteousness? Shall he estimate it by the weight? Truly he will be in\ngreat uncertainty to which side to incline the balance; because he will\nnot be able to assume to himself as much righteousness as may be necessary\nto his confidence. It is well that he, who would wish to prescribe laws to\nGod, is not the arbiter of this cause. But this address of David to God\nwill remain: “That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be\nclear when thou judgest.”(1913) And what extreme arrogance it is to\ncondemn the supreme Judge when he freely absolves, and not to be satisfied\nwith this answer, “I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy!”(1914) And\nyet the intercession of Moses, which God checked with this reply, was not\nthat he would spare none, but that, though they were guilty, he would\nremove their guilt and absolve them all at once. We affirm, therefore,\nthat those who were undone are justified before God by the obliteration of\ntheir sins; because, sin being the object of his hatred, he can love none\nbut those whom he justifies. But this is a wonderful method of\njustification, that sinners, being invested with the righteousness of\nChrist, dread not the judgment which they have deserved; and that, while\nthey justly condemn themselves, they are accounted righteous out of\nthemselves.\nXII. But the readers must be cautioned to pay a strict attention to the\nmystery which Osiander boasts that he will not conceal from them. For,\nafter having contended with great prolixity, that we do not obtain favour\nwith God solely through the imputation of the righteousness of Christ,\nbecause it would be impossible for him to esteem those as righteous who\nare not so, (I use his own words,) he at length concludes, that Christ is\ngiven to us for righteousness, not in respect of his human, but of his\nDivine nature; and that, though this righteousness can only be found in\nthe person of the Mediator, yet it is the righteousness, not of man, but\nof God. He does not combine two righteousnesses, but evidently deprives\nthe humanity of Christ of all concern in the matter of justification. It\nis worth while, however, to hear what arguments he adduces. It is said in\nthe passage referred to, that “Christ is made unto us wisdom,”(1915) which\nis applicable only to the eternal Word. Neither, therefore, is Christ,\nconsidered as man our righteousness. I reply, that the only begotten Son\nof God was indeed his eternal wisdom; but this title is here ascribed to\nhim by Paul in a different sense, because “in him are hid all the\ntreasures of wisdom and knowledge.”(1916) What, therefore, he had with the\nFather, he has manifested to us; and so what Paul says, refers not to the\nessence of the Son of God, but to our benefit, and is rightly applied to\nthe humanity of Christ; because, although he was a light shining in\ndarkness before his assumption of the flesh, yet he was a hidden light\ntill he appeared in the nature of man “as the Sun of righteousness;”(1917)\nwherefore he calls himself “the light of the world.”(1918) Osiander\nbetrays his folly likewise in objecting, that justification exceeds the\npower of angels and men; since it depends not upon the dignity of any\ncreature, but upon the appointment of God. If angels were desirous to\noffer a satisfaction to God, it would be unavailing; because they have not\nbeen appointed to it. This was peculiar to the man Christ, who was “made\nunder the law, to redeem us from the curse of the law.”(1919) He likewise\nvery unjustly accuses those who deny that Christ is our righteousness\naccording to his Divine nature, of retaining only one part of Christ, and\n(what is worse) making two Gods; because, though they acknowledge that God\ndwells in us, yet they flatly deny that we are righteous through the\nrighteousness of God. For if we call Christ the author of life in\nconsequence of his having suffered death, “that he might destroy him that\nhad the power of death,”(1920) it is not to be inferred that we deny this\nhonour to his complete person, as God manifested in the flesh: we only\nstate with precision the means by which the righteousness of God is\nconveyed to us, so that we may enjoy it. In this, Osiander has fallen into\na very pernicious error. We do not deny, that what is openly exhibited to\nus in Christ flows from the secret grace and power of God; nor do we\nrefuse to admit, that the righteousness conferred on us by Christ is the\nrighteousness of God as proceeding from him; but we constantly maintain\nthat we have righteousness and life in the death and resurrection of\nChrist. I pass over that shameful accumulation of passages, with which,\nwithout any discrimination, and even without common sense, he has burdened\nthe reader, in order to evince, that wherever mention is made of\nrighteousness, it ought to be understood of this essential righteousness;\nas where David implores the righteousness of God to assist him; which as\nhe does above a hundred times, Osiander hesitates not to pervert such a\ngreat number of passages. Nor is there any thing more solid in his other\nobjection, that the term “righteousness” is properly and rightly applied\nto that by which we are excited to rectitude of conduct, and that God\nalone “worketh in us both to will and to do.”(1921) Now, we do not deny,\nthat God renews us by his Spirit to holiness and righteousness of life;\nbut it should first be inquired, whether he does this immediately by\nhimself, or through the medium of his Son, with whom he has deposited all\nthe plenitude of his Spirit, that with his abundance he might relieve the\nnecessities of his members. Besides, though righteousness flows to us from\nthe secret fountain of the Divinity, yet it does not follow that Christ,\nwho in the flesh sanctified himself for our sakes,(1922) is our\nrighteousness with respect to his Divine nature. Equally frivolous is his\nassertion, that Christ himself was righteous with the righteousness of\nGod; because, if he had not been influenced by the will of the Father, not\neven he could have performed the part assigned him. For though it has been\nelsewhere observed, that all the merit of Christ himself flows from the\nmere favour of God, yet this affords no countenance to the fanciful notion\nwith which Osiander fascinates his own eyes and those of the injudicious.\nFor who would admit the inference, that because God is the original source\nof our righteousness, we are therefore essentially righteous, and have the\nessence of the Divine righteousness residing in us? In redeeming the\nChurch (Isaiah says) God “put on righteousness as a breastplate;”(1923)\nbut was it to spoil Christ of the armour which he had given him, and to\nprevent his being a perfect Redeemer? The prophet only meant that God\nborrowed nothing extrinsic to himself, and had no assistance in the work\nof our redemption. Paul has briefly intimated the same in other words,\nsaying that he has given us salvation in order “to declare his\nrighteousness.”(1924) Nor does this at all contradict what he states in\nanother place, “that by the obedience of one we are made righteous.”(1925)\nTo conclude: whoever fabricates a twofold righteousness, that wretched\nsouls may not rely wholly and exclusively on the Divine mercy, makes\nChrist an object of contempt, and crowns him with platted thorns.\nXIII. But as many persons imagine righteousness to be composed of faith\nand works, let us also prove, before we proceed, that the righteousness of\nfaith is so exceedingly different from that of works, that if one be\nestablished, the other must necessarily be subverted. The apostle says, “I\ncount all things but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not\nhaving mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is\nthrough the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by\nfaith.”(1926) Here we see a comparison of two opposites, and an\nimplication that his own righteousness must be forsaken by him who wishes\nto obtain the righteousness of Christ. Wherefore, in another place, he\nstates this to have been the cause of the ruin of the Jews, that, “going\nabout to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted\nthemselves unto the righteousness of God.”(1927) If, by establishing our\nown righteousness, we reject the righteousness of God, then, in order to\nobtain the latter, the former must doubtless be entirely renounced. He\nconveys the same sentiment when he asserts, that “boasting is excluded. By\nwhat law? of works? Nay; but by the law of faith.”(1928) Whence it\nfollows, that as long as there remains the least particle of righteousness\nin our works, we retain some cause for boasting. But if faith excludes all\nboasting, the righteousness of works can by no means be associated with\nthe righteousness of faith. To this purpose he speaks so clearly in the\nfourth chapter to the Romans, as to leave no room for cavil or evasion.\n“If Abraham (says he) were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory.”\nHe adds, “but” he hath “not” whereof to glory “before God.”(1929) It\nfollows, therefore, that he was not justified by works. Then he advances\nanother argument from two opposites. “To him that worketh is the reward\nnot reckoned of grace, but of debt.”(1930) But righteousness is attributed\nto faith through grace. Therefore it is not from the merit of works.\nAdieu, therefore, to the fanciful notion of those who imagine a\nrighteousness compounded of faith and works.\nXIV. The sophists, who amuse and delight themselves with perversion of the\nScripture and vain cavils, think they have found a most excellent\nsubterfuge, when they explain _works_, in these passages, to mean those\nwhich men yet unregenerate perform without the grace of Christ, merely\nthrough the unassisted efforts of their own free‐will; and deny that they\nrelate to spiritual works. Thus, according to them, a man is justified\nboth by faith and by works, only the works are not properly his own, but\nthe gifts of Christ and the fruits of regeneration. For they say that Paul\nspoke in this manner, only that the Jews, who relied on their own\nstrength, might be convinced of their folly in arrogating righteousness to\nthemselves, whereas it is conferred on us solely by the Spirit of Christ,\nnot by any exertion properly our own. But they do not observe, that in the\ncontrast of legal and evangelical righteousness, which Paul introduces in\nanother place, all works are excluded, by what title soever they may be\ndistinguished. For he teaches that this is the righteousness of the law,\nthat he who has fulfilled the command of the law shall obtain\nsalvation;(1931) but that the righteousness of faith consists in believing\nthat Christ has died and is risen again.(1932) Besides, we shall see, as\nwe proceed, in its proper place, that sanctification and righteousness are\nseparate blessings of Christ. Whence it follows, that even spiritual works\nare not taken into the account, when the power of justifying is attributed\nto faith. And the assertion of Paul, in the place just cited, that Abraham\nhas not whereof to glory before God, since he was not justified by works,\nought not to be restricted to any literal appearance or external display\nof virtue, or to any efforts of free‐will; but though the life of the\npatriarch was spiritual, and almost angelic, yet his works did not possess\nsufficient merit to justify him before God.\nXV. The errors of the schoolmen, who mingle their preparations, are rather\nmore gross; but they instil into the simple and incautious a doctrine\nequally corrupt, while under the pretext of the Spirit and of grace, they\nconceal the mercy of God, which alone can calm the terrors of the\nconscience. We confess, indeed, with Paul, that “the doers of the law are\njustified before God;”(1933) but since we are all far from being observers\nof the law, we conclude, that those works which should be principally\navailable to justification, afford us no assistance, because we are\ndestitute of them. With respect to the common Papists, or schoolmen, they\nare in this matter doubly deceived; both in denominating faith a certainty\nof conscience in expecting from God a reward of merit, and in explaining\nthe grace of God to be, not an imputation of gratuitous righteousness, but\nthe Spirit assisting to the pursuit of holiness. They read in the apostle,\n“He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder\nof them that diligently seek him.”(1934) But they do not consider the\nmanner of seeking him. And that they mistake the sense of the word\n“grace,” is evident from their writings. For Lombard represents\njustification by Christ as given us in two ways. He says, “The death of\nChrist justifies us, first, because it excites charity in our hearts, by\nwhich we are made actually righteous; secondly, because it destroys sin,\nby which the devil held us in captivity, so that now it cannot condemn\nus.” We see how he considers the grace of God in justification to consist\nin our being directed to good works by the grace of the Holy Spirit. He\nwished, indeed, to follow the opinion of Augustine; but he follows him at\na great distance, and even deviates considerably from a close imitation of\nhim; for whatever he finds clearly stated by him, he obscures, and\nwhatever he finds pure in him, he corrupts. The schools have always been\nrunning into worse and worse errors, till at length they have precipitated\nthemselves into a kind of Pelagianism. Nor, indeed, is the opinion of\nAugustine, or at least his manner of expression, to be altogether\nadmitted. For though he excellently despoils man of all the praise of\nrighteousness, and ascribes the whole to the grace of God, yet he refers\ngrace to sanctification, in which we are regenerated by the Spirit to\nnewness of life.\nXVI. The Scripture, when speaking of the righteousness of faith, leads us\nto something very different. It teaches us, that being diverted from the\ncontemplation of our own works, we should regard nothing but the mercy of\nGod and the perfection of Christ. For it states this to be the order of\njustification; that from the beginning God deigns to embrace sinful man\nwith his pure and gratuitous goodness, contemplating nothing in him to\nexcite mercy, but his misery; (for God beholds him utterly destitute of\nall good works;) deriving from himself the motive for blessing him, that\nhe may affect the sinner himself with a sense of his supreme goodness,\nwho, losing all confidence in his own works, rests the whole of his\nsalvation on the Divine mercy. This is the sentiment of faith, by which\nthe sinner comes to the enjoyment of his salvation, when he knows from the\ndoctrine of the gospel that he is reconciled to God; that having obtained\nremission of sins, he is justified by the intervention of the\nrighteousness of Christ; and though regenerated by the Spirit of God, he\nthinks on everlasting righteousness reserved for him, not in the good\nworks to which he devotes himself, but solely in the righteousness of\nChrist. When all these things shall have been particularly examined, they\nwill afford a perspicuous explication of our opinion. They will, however,\nbe better digested in a different order from that in which they have been\nproposed. But it is of little importance, provided they are so connected\nwith each other, that we may have the whole subject rightly stated and\nwell confirmed.\nXVII. Here it is proper to recall to remembrance the relation we have\nbefore stated between faith and the gospel; since the reason why faith is\nsaid to justify, is, that it receives and embraces the righteousness\noffered in the gospel. But its being offered by the gospel absolutely\nexcludes all consideration of works. This Paul very clearly demonstrates\non various occasions; and particularly in two passages. In his Epistle to\nthe Romans, contrasting the law and the gospel, he says, “Moses describeth\nthe righteousness which is of the law, that the man which doeth those\nthings shall live by them. But the righteousness which is of faith\nspeaketh on this wise: That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord\nJesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the\ndead, thou shalt be saved.”(1935) Do you perceive how he thus\ndiscriminates between the law and the gospel, that the former attributes\nrighteousness to works, but the latter bestows it freely, without the\nassistance of works? It is a remarkable passage, and may serve to\nextricate us from a multitude of difficulties, if we understand that the\nrighteousness which is given us by the gospel is free from all legal\nconditions. This is the reason why he more than once strongly opposes the\n_promise_ to the _law_. “If the inheritance be of the law, it is no more\nof promise;”(1936) and more in the same chapter to the same purpose. It is\ncertain that the law also has its promises. Wherefore, unless we will\nconfess the comparison to be improper, there must be something distinct\nand different in the promises of the gospel. Now, what can that be, but\nthat they are gratuitous and solely dependent on the Divine mercy, whilst\nthe promises of the law depend on the condition of works? Nor let any one\nobject, that it is only the righteousness which men would obtrude on God\nfrom their own natural powers and free‐will that is rejected; since Paul\nteaches it as a universal truth, that the precepts of the law are\nunprofitable, because, not only among the vulgar, but even among the very\nbest of men, there is not one who can fulfil them.(1937) Love is certainly\nthe principal branch of the law: when the Spirit of God forms us to it,\nwhy does it not constitute any part of our righteousness, but because even\nin the saints it is imperfect, and therefore of itself deserves no reward?\nXVIII. The other passage is as follows: “That no man is justified by the\nlaw in the sight of God, it is evident; for, The just shall live by faith.\nAnd the law is not of faith; but, The man that doeth them shall live in\nthem.”(1938) How could this argument be supported, unless it were certain\nthat works do not come into the account of faith, but are to be entirely\nseparated from it? The law, he says, differs from faith. Why? Because\nworks are required to the righteousness of the law. It follows, therefore,\nthat works are not required to the righteousness of faith. From this\nstatement it appears, that they who are justified by faith, are justified\nwithout the merit of works, and beyond the merit of works; for faith\nreceives that righteousness which the gospel bestows; and the gospel\ndiffers from the law in this respect, that it does not confine\nrighteousness to works, but rests it entirely on the mercy of God. He\nargues in a similar manner to the Romans, that “Abraham had not whereof to\nglory; for he believed God, and it was counted unto him for\nrighteousness;”(1939) and by way of confirmation he subjoins, that then\nthere is room for the righteousness of faith when there are no works which\nmerit any reward. He tells us, that where there are works, they receive a\nreward “of debt,” but that what is given to faith is “of grace;” for this\nis the clear import of the language which he there uses. When he adds, a\nlittle after, “Therefore it is of faith” that we obtain the inheritance,\nin order “that it might be by grace,”(1940) he infers that the inheritance\nis gratuitous, because it is received by faith: and why is this, but\nbecause faith, without any assistance of works, depends wholly on the\nDivine mercy? And in the same sense undoubtedly he elsewhere teaches us,\nthat “the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being\nwitnessed by the law and the prophets;”(1941) because, by excluding the\nlaw, he denies that righteousness is assisted by works, or that we obtain\nit by working, but asserts that we come empty in order to receive it.\nXIX. The reader will now discover, with what justice the sophists of the\npresent day cavil at our doctrine, when we say _that a man is justified by\nfaith only_. That a man is justified _by faith_, they do not deny, because\nthe Scripture so often declares it; but since it is nowhere expressly said\nto be by faith only, they cannot bear this addition to be made. But what\nreply will they give to these words of Paul, where he contends that\n“righteousness is not of faith unless it be gratuitous?”(1942) How can any\nthing gratuitous consist with works? And by what cavils will they elude\nwhat he asserts in another place, that in the gospel “is the righteousness\nof God revealed?”(1943) If righteousness is revealed in the gospel, it is\ncertainly not a mutilated and partial, but a complete and perfect one. The\nlaw, therefore, has no concern in it. And respecting this exclusive\nparticle, _only_, they rest on an evasion which is not only false, but\nglaringly ridiculous. For does not he most completely attribute every\nthing to faith alone, who denies every thing to works? What is the meaning\nof these expressions of Paul? “Righteousness is manifested without the\nlaw,” “justified freely by his grace,” “justified without the deeds of the\nlaw.”(1944) Here they have an ingenious subterfuge, which, though it is\nnot of their own invention, but borrowed from Origen and some of the\nancients, is nevertheless very absurd. They pretend that the works\nexcluded are the ceremonial works of the law, not the moral works. They\nhave made such a proficiency by their perpetual disputations, that they\nhave forgotten the first elements of logic. Do they suppose the apostle to\nhave been insane, when he adduced these passages in proof of his doctrine?\n“The man that doeth them shall live in them;” and “Cursed is every one\nthat continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law\nto do them.”(1945) If they be in their sober senses, they will not assert\nthat life was promised to the observers of ceremonies, and the curse\ndenounced merely on the transgressors of them. If these places are to be\nunderstood of the moral law, it is beyond a doubt, that moral works\nlikewise are excluded from the power to justify. To the same purpose are\nthese arguments which he uses: “For by the law is the knowledge of sin;”\nconsequently not righteousness. “Because the law worketh wrath,”(1946)\ntherefore not righteousness. Since the law cannot assure our consciences,\nneither can it confer righteousness. Since faith is counted for\nrighteousness, consequently righteousness is not a reward of works, but is\ngratuitously bestowed. Since we are justified by faith, boasting is\nprecluded. “If there had been a law given which could have given life,\nverily righteousness should have been by the law. But the Scripture hath\nconcluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might\nbe given to them that believe.”(1947) Let them idly pretend, if they dare,\nthat these are applicable to ceremonies, not to morals; but even children\nwould explode such consummate impudence. We may therefore be assured, that\nwhen the power of justifying is denied to the law, the whole law is\nincluded.\nXX. If any one should wonder why the apostle does not content himself with\nsimply mentioning _works_, but says _works of the law_, the reason is\nobvious. For though works are so greatly esteemed, they derive their value\nfrom the Divine approbation rather than from any intrinsic excellence. For\nwho can dare to boast to God of any righteousness of works, but what he\nhas approved? Who can dare to claim any reward as due to them, but what he\nhas promised? It is owing, therefore, to the Divine favour, that they are\naccounted worthy both of the title and of the reward of righteousness; and\nso they are valuable, only when they are intended as acts of obedience to\nGod. Wherefore the apostle, in another place, in order to prove that\nAbraham could not be justified by works, alleges, that “the law was four\nhundred and thirty years after the covenant was confirmed.”(1948) Ignorant\npersons would ridicule such an argument, because there might have been\nrighteous works before the promulgation of the law; but knowing that works\nhave no such intrinsic worth, independently of the testimony and esteem of\nGod, he has taken it for granted that, antecedently to the law, they had\nno power to justify. We know why he expressly mentions “the works of the\nlaw,” when he means to deny justification by works; it is because they\nalone can furnish any occasion of controversy. However, he likewise\nexcludes all works, without any limitation, as when he says, “David\ndescribeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth\nrighteousness without works.”(1949) They cannot, therefore, by any\nsubtleties prevent us from retaining this general exclusive particle. It\nis in vain, also, that they catch at another frivolous subtlety, alleging\nthat we are justified only by that “faith which worketh by love;”(1950)\nwith a view to represent righteousness as depending on love. We\nacknowledge, indeed, with Paul, that no other faith justifies, except that\n“which worketh by love;” but it does not derive its power to justify from\nthe efficacy of that love. It justifies in no other way than as it\nintroduces us into a participation of the righteousness of Christ.\nOtherwise there would be no force in the argument so strenuously urged by\nthe apostle. “To him that worketh,” says he, “is the reward not reckoned\nof grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him\nthat justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for\nrighteousness.”(1951) Was it possible for him to speak more plainly than\nby thus asserting, that there is no righteousness of faith, except where\nthere are no works entitled to any reward; and that faith is imputed for\nrighteousness, only when righteousness is conferred through unmerited\ngrace?\nXXI. Now, let us examine the truth of what has been asserted in the\ndefinition, that the righteousness of faith is a reconciliation with God,\nwhich consists solely in remission of sins.(1952) We must always return to\nthis axiom—That the Divine wrath remains on all men, as long as they\ncontinue to be sinners. This Isaiah has beautifully expressed in the\nfollowing words: “The Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;\nneither is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have\nseparated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from\nyou, that he will not hear.”(1953) We are informed, that sin makes a\ndivision between man and God, and turns the Divine countenance away from\nthe sinner. Nor can it be otherwise; because it is incompatible with his\nrighteousness to have any communion with sin. Hence the apostle teaches,\nthat man is an enemy to God, till he be reconciled to him through\nChrist.(1954) Whom, therefore, the Lord receives into fellowship, him he\nis said to justify; because he cannot receive any one into favour or into\nfellowship with himself, without making him from a sinner to be a\nrighteous person. This, we add, is accomplished by the remission of sins.\nFor if they, whom the Lord has reconciled to himself, be judged according\nto their works, they will still be found actually sinners; who,\nnotwithstanding, must be absolved and free from sin. It appears, then,\nthat those whom God receives, are made righteous no otherwise than as they\nare purified by being cleansed from all their defilements by the remission\nof their sins; so that such a righteousness may, in one word, be\ndenominated a remission of sins.\nXXII. Both these points are fully established by the language of Paul,\nwhich I have already recited. “God was in Christ, reconciling the world\nunto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed\nunto us the word of reconciliation.”(1955) Then he adds the substance of\nhis ministry: “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we\nmight be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1956) The terms\n“righteousness” and “reconciliation” are here used by him\nindiscriminately, to teach us that they are mutually comprehended in each\nother. And he states the manner of obtaining this righteousness to consist\nin our transgressions not being imputed to us. Wherefore we can no longer\ndoubt how God justifies, when we hear that he reconciles us to himself by\nnot imputing our sins to us. Thus, in the Epistle to the Romans, the\napostle proves, that “God imputeth righteousness without works,” from the\ntestimony of David, who declares, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are\nforgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord\nwill not impute sin.”(1957) By “blessedness,” in this passage, he\nundoubtedly means righteousness; for since he asserts it to consist in\nremission of sins, there is no reason for our adopting any other\ndefinition of it. Wherefore Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist,\nplaces “the knowledge of salvation” in “the remission of sins.”(1958) And\nPaul, observing the same rule in the sermon which he preached to the\npeople of Antioch on the subject of salvation, is stated by Luke to have\nconcluded in the following manner: “Through this man is preached unto you\nthe forgiveness of sins; and by him all that believe are justified from\nall things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of\nMoses.”(1959) The apostle thus connects “forgiveness of sins” with\n“justification,” to show that they are identically the same; whence he\njustly argues, that this righteousness which we obtain through the favour\nof God is gratuitously bestowed upon us. Nor should it be thought a\nstrange expression, that believers are justified before God, not by their\nworks, but by his gracious acceptance of them; since it occurs so\nfrequently in the Scripture, and sometimes also in the fathers. Augustine\nsays, “The righteousness of the saints, in this world, consists rather in\nthe remission of their sins than in the perfection of their virtues.” With\nwhich corresponds the remarkable observation of Bernard: “Not to sin at\nall, is the righteousness of God; but the righteousness of man is the\nDivine grace and mercy.” He had before asserted, “that Christ is\nrighteousness to us in absolution, and therefore that they alone are\nrighteous who have obtained pardon through his mercy.”\nXXIII. Hence, also, it is evident, that we obtain justification before\nGod, solely by the intervention of the righteousness of Christ. Which is\nequivalent to saying, that a man is righteous, not in himself, but because\nthe righteousness of Christ is communicated to him by imputation; and this\nis a point which deserves an attentive consideration. For it supersedes\nthat idle notion, that a man is justified by faith, because faith receives\nthe Spirit of God by whom he is made righteous; which is too repugnant to\nthe foregoing doctrine, ever to be reconcilable to it. For he must\ncertainly be destitute of all righteousness of his own, who is taught to\nseek a righteousness out of himself. This is most clearly asserted by the\napostle, when he says, “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no\nsin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”(1960) We see\nthat our righteousness is not in ourselves, but in Christ; and that all\nour title to it rests solely on our being partakers of Christ; for in\npossessing him, we possess all his riches with him. Nor does any objection\narise from what he states in another place, that “God, sending his own Son\nin the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh;\nthat the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us;”(1961) where\nhe intends no other fulfilment than what we obtain by imputation. For the\nLord Christ so communicates his righteousness to us, that, with reference\nto the Divine judgment, he transfuses its virtue into us in a most\nwonderful manner. That the apostle intended no other, abundantly appears\nfrom another declaration, which he had made just before: “As by one man’s\ndisobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many\nbe made righteous.”(1962) What is placing our righteousness in the\nobedience of Christ, but asserting, that we are accounted righteous only\nbecause his obedience is accepted for us as if it were our own? Wherefore\nAmbrose appears to me to have very beautifully exemplified this\nrighteousness in the benediction of Jacob; that as he, who had on his own\naccount no claim to the privileges of primogeniture, being concealed in\nhis brother’s habit, and invested with his garment, which diffused a most\nexcellent odour, insinuated himself into the favour of his father, that he\nmight receive the benediction to his own advantage, under the character of\nanother; so we shelter ourselves under the precious purity of Christ our\nelder brother, that we may obtain the testimony of righteousness in the\nsight of God. The words of Ambrose are, “That Isaac smelled the odour of\nthe garments, perhaps indicates, that we are justified not by works, but\nby faith; since the infirmity of the flesh is an impediment to works, but\nthe brightness of faith, which merits the pardon of sin, conceals the\nerror of our actions.” And such is indeed the real fact; for that we may\nappear before the face of God to salvation, it is necessary for us to be\nperfumed with his fragrance, and to have all our deformities concealed and\nabsorbed in his perfection."

          "title": "Chapter XII. A Consideration Of The Divine Tribunal, Necessary To A",
          "content": "Serious Conviction Of Gratuitous Justification.\nThough it appears, from the plainest testimonies, that all these things\nare strictly true, yet we shall not clearly discover how necessary they\nare, till we shall have taken a view of what ought to be the foundation of\nall this argument. In the first place, therefore, we should reflect that\nwe are not treating of the righteousness of a human court, but of that of\nthe heavenly tribunal; in order that we may not apply any diminutive\nstandard of our own, to estimate the integrity of conduct required to\nsatisfy the Divine justice. But it is wonderful, with what temerity and\npresumption this is commonly decided; and it is even observable, that no\nmen give us more confident or pompous declamations concerning the\nrighteousness of works, than those who are notoriously guilty of open sins\nor addicted to secret vices. This arises from their never thinking of the\nrighteousness of God, the smallest sense of which would prevent them from\ntreating it with such contempt. And certainly it is exceedingly\nundervalued, if it be not acknowledged to be so perfect that nothing can\nbe acceptable to it but what is absolutely complete and immaculate, such\nas it never was, nor ever will be, possible to find in fallen man. It is\neasy for any one in the cloisters of the schools, to indulge himself in\nidle speculations on the merit of works to justify men; but when he comes\ninto the presence of God, he must bid farewell to these amusements, for\nthere the business is transacted with seriousness, and no ludicrous\nlogomachy practised. To this point, then, must our attention be directed,\nif we wish to make any useful inquiry concerning true righteousness; how\nwe can answer the celestial Judge, when he shall call us to an account.\nLet us place that Judge before our eyes, not according to the spontaneous\nimaginations of our minds, but according to the descriptions given of him\nin the Scripture; which represents him as one whose refulgence eclipses\nthe stars, whose power melts the mountains, whose anger shakes the earth,\nwhose wisdom takes the subtle in their own craftiness, whose purity makes\nall things appear polluted, whose righteousness even the angels are unable\nto bear, who acquits not the guilty, whose vengeance, when it is once\nkindled, penetrates even to the abyss of hell.(1963) Let him seat himself,\nI say, on the tribunal, to examine the actions of men: who will present\nhimself fearless before his throne? “Who shall dwell with the devouring\nfire?” saith the prophet. “Who shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He\nthat walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly,” &c.(1964) Now let him\ncome forward, whoever he is. But this answer causes not one to appear.\nFor, on the contrary, we hear this fearful speech, “If thou, Lord,\nshouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?”(1965) In truth, all\nmust speedily perish, as it is written in another place, “Shall mortal man\nbe more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Behold, he\nput no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly; how\nmuch less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the\ndust, which are crushed before the moth? They are destroyed from morning\nto evening.”(1966) Again: “Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea,\nthe heavens are not clean in his sight; how much more abominable and\nfilthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?”(1967) I confess that\nin the Book of Job mention is made of a righteousness which is superior to\nthe observance of the law. And it will be of use to remember this\ndistinction; because, though any one could satisfy the law, he could not\neven then stand the scrutiny of that righteousness which exceeds all\ncomprehension. Therefore, though Job is conscious of his own integrity,\nyet he is mute with astonishment, when he sees that God could not be\npleased even with the sanctity of angels, if he were to enter into a\nstrict examination of their works. I shall, therefore, now pass over that\nrighteousness to which I have alluded, because it is incomprehensible, and\ncontent myself with asserting, that we must be worse than stupid, if, on\nan examination of our lives by the rule of the written law, we are not\ntormented with awful dread in consequence of so many maledictions, which\nGod has designed to arouse us, and among the rest this general one:\n“Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do\nthem.”(1968) In short, this whole controversy will be uninteresting and\nuseless, unless every one present himself as a criminal before the\ncelestial Judge, and voluntarily prostrate and humble himself in deep\nsolicitude concerning his absolution.\nII. To this point our eyes ought to have been raised, that we might learn\nrather to tremble through fear, than to indulge in vain exultation. It is\neasy, indeed, while the comparison is made only between men, for every man\nto imagine himself to be possessed of something which others ought not to\ncontemn; but when we ascend to the contemplation of God, that confidence\nis immediately lost. And the case of our soul with respect to God is\nsimilar to that of our body with respect to the visible heavens; for the\neye, as long as it is employed in beholding adjacent objects, receives\nproofs of its own perspicacity; but if it be directed towards the sun,\ndazzled and confounded with his overpowering brightness, it feels no less\ndebility in beholding him, than strength in the view of inferior objects.\nLet us not, then, deceive ourselves with a vain confidence, although we\nconsider ourselves equal or superior to other men. That is nothing to God,\nto whose decision this cause must be submitted. But if our insolence\ncannot be restrained by these admonitions, he will reply to us in the\nlanguage which he addressed to the Pharisees: “Ye are they which justify\nyourselves before men; but that which is highly esteemed among men, is\nabomination in the sight of God.”(1969) Go now, and among men proudly\nglory in your righteousness, while the God of heaven abominates it. But\nwhat is the language of the servants of God, who are truly taught by his\nSpirit? One says, “Enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy\nsight shall no man living be justified.”(1970) And another, though in a\nsense somewhat different, “How should man be just with God? If he will\ncontend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.”(1971) Here we\nare plainly informed respecting the righteousness of God, that it is such\nas no human works can satisfy; and such as renders it impossible for us,\nif accused of a thousand crimes, to exculpate ourselves from one of them.\nThe same idea of this righteousness had very properly been entertained by\nPaul, that “chosen vessel”(1972) of God, when he professed, “I am\nconscious to myself of nothing; yet am I not hereby justified.”(1973)\nIII. Nor is it only in the sacred Scriptures that such examples are found.\nAll pious writers discover similar sentiments. Thus Augustine says, “The\nonly hope of all the pious, who groan under this burden of corruptible\nflesh, and amidst the infirmities of this life, is, that we have a\nMediator, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our\nsins.” What is the meaning of this observation? If this is their only\nhope, where is any confidence in works? For when he asserts this to be the\nonly one, he precludes every other. Bernard also says, “And in fact where\ncan be found safe and solid rest and security for the weak, but in the\nwounds of the Saviour? There I dwell with the greater security, in\nproportion to his power to save. The world rages, the body oppresses, the\ndevil lies in wait to destroy. I do not fall, because my foundation is on\na firm rock. I have committed heinous sin. My conscience is disturbed, but\nshall not fall into despair, because I shall recall to remembrance the\nwounds of the Lord.” From these considerations he afterwards concludes,\n“My merit, therefore, is the compassion of the Lord: I am clearly not\ndestitute of merit, as long as he is not destitute of compassions. But if\nthe mercies of the Lord be a multitude of mercies, my merits are likewise\nequally numerous. Shall I sing of my own righteousness? O Lord, I will\nremember thy righteousness alone. For it is mine also, since he is made of\nGod righteousness unto me.” Again, in another place: “This is the whole\nmerit of man—to fix all his hope on him who saves the whole man.” Likewise\nin another place, retaining peace to himself, and ascribing the glory to\nGod, he says, “To thee let the glory remain undiminished. It is happy for\nme, if I have peace. The glory I entirely renounce; lest, if I usurp what\nis not mine, I lose also that which is offered me.” In another place he is\nstill more explicit: “Why should the Church be solicitous about merits,\nwhile it has a stronger and more secure reason for glorying in the designs\nof God? You need not inquire on account of what merits we hope for\nblessings, especially when you read in the prophet, ‘Thus saith the Lord\nGod; I do not this for your sakes, but for mine holy name’s sake.’(1974)\nIt suffices with respect to merit, to know that merits are not sufficient;\nbut as it suffices for merit not to presume on merits, so to be destitute\nof merits is sufficient cause of condemnation.” We must excuse his custom\nof freely using the word _merits_ for good works. But his ultimate design\nwas to terrify hypocrites, who indulge themselves in a licentious course\nof sin against the grace of God; as he presently declares: “Happy is the\nChurch which wants neither merits without presumption, nor presumption\nwithout merits. It has some ground of presumption, but not merits. It has\nmerits, but in order to deserve, not to presume. Is not the absence of\npresumption itself a merit? Therefore the Church presumes the more\nsecurely, because it does not presume, having ample cause for glorying in\nthe multitude of the Divine mercies.”\nIV. This is the real truth. The troubled conscience finds this to be the\nonly asylum of safety, where it can enjoy any tranquillity, when it has to\ndo with the Divine justice. For if the stars, which appeared most\nbrilliant during the night, lose their splendour on the rising of the sun,\nwhat can we suppose will be the case with the most excellent innocence of\nman, when compared with the purity of God? For that will be an examination\ninconceivably severe, which shall penetrate into all the most secret\nthoughts of the heart, and, as Paul says, “bring to light the hidden\nthings of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts;”(1975)\nwhich shall constrain the reluctant conscience to confess all those things\nwhich have now passed away even from our own remembrance. We shall be\nurged by an accusing devil, who has been privy to all the crimes which he\nhas impelled us to perpetrate. There the external appearance of good\nworks, which now is the sole object of esteem, will be of no avail;\nsincerity of heart is all that will be required. Wherefore hypocrisy, not\nonly that by which a man, conscious of his guilt before God, affects\nostentation before men, but that also by which every man imposes on\nhimself before God, for we are all prone to self‐complacency and\nadulation; hypocrisy in all its forms will then be overwhelmed with\nconfusion, however it may now be intoxicated with presumption and pride.\nPersons who never look forward to such a spectacle, may, indeed,\ndelightfully and complacently compose for themselves a temporary\nrighteousness, of which they will immediately be stripped at the Divine\njudgment; just as immense riches, accumulated by us in a dream, vanish as\nsoon as we awake. But they who inquire seriously, and as in the presence\nof God, respecting the true standard of righteousness, will certainly find\nthat all the actions of men, if estimated according to their intrinsic\nworth, are utterly defiled and polluted; that what is commonly considered\nas righteousness, is, in the Divine view, nothing but iniquity; that what\nis accounted integrity, is mere pollution; and that what is reputed glory,\nis real ignominy.\nV. From this contemplation of the Divine perfection, let us not be\nunwilling to descend to take a view of ourselves, without adulation or\nblind self‐love. For it is not to be wondered at, if we are so extremely\nblind in this respect, since not one of us is sufficiently cautious of\nthat pestilent self‐indulgence, which the Scripture declares to be\nnaturally inherent in us all. “Every way of man,” says Solomon, “is right\nin his own eyes.”(1976) Again: “All the ways of a man are clean in his own\neyes.”(1977) But what follows from this? Is he absolved from guilt by this\ndelusion? Not at all; but, as is immediately added, “the Lord weigheth the\nspirits;” that is, while men are congratulating themselves on account of\nthe external mask of righteousness which they wear, the Lord is at the\nsame time weighing in his own balance the latent impurity of their hearts.\nSince we are so far from deriving any advantage, therefore, from such\nblandishments, let us not voluntarily delude ourselves to our own\nperdition. That we may examine ourselves properly, it is necessary for us\nto summon our conscience to the tribunal of God. For we have the greatest\nneed of his light in order to detect the recesses of our depravity, which\notherwise are too deeply concealed. For then only shall we clearly\nperceive the force of this language: “How can man be justified with\nGod—man, who is” corruption and “a worm, abominable and filthy, and who\ndrinketh iniquity like water?”(1978) “Who can bring a clean thing out of\nan unclean? Not one.”(1979) Then also we shall experience what Job said\nconcerning himself: “If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me;\nif I say I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.”(1980) For the\ncomplaint, which the prophet formerly made respecting Israel, “All we like\nsheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;”(1981) is\napplicable not only to one period of time, but to all ages. For he there\ncomprehends all to whom the grace of redemption was to extend; and the\nrigour of this examination ought to proceed till it shall have filled us\nwith complete consternation, and thus prepared us to receive the grace of\nChrist. For he is deceived who supposes himself capable of this enjoyment,\nwithout having first been truly humbled. It is a well‐known observation,\nthat “God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.”(1982)\nVI. But what means have we of humbling ourselves, except by submitting,\nall poor and destitute, to the Divine mercy? For I do not call it\nhumility, if we suppose that we have any thing left. And hitherto they\nhave taught a pernicious hypocrisy, who have connected these two\nmaxims—that we should entertain humble thoughts of ourselves before God,\nand that we should attach some dignity to our own righteousness. For if we\naddress to God a confession which is contrary to our real sentiments, we\nare guilty of telling him an impudent falsehood; but we cannot think of\nourselves as we ought to think, without utterly despising every thing that\nmay be supposed an excellence in us. When we hear, therefore, from the\nPsalmist, that “God will save the afflicted people, but will bring down\nhigh looks,”(1983) let us consider, first, that there is no way of\nsalvation till we have laid aside all pride, and attained sincere\nhumility; secondly, that this humility is not a species of modesty,\nconsisting in conceding to God a small portion of what we might justly\nclaim, as they are called humble among men, who neither haughtily exalt\nthemselves nor behave with insolence to others, while they nevertheless\nentertain some consciousness of excellence: this humility is the unfeigned\nsubmission of a mind overwhelmed with a weighty sense of its own misery\nand poverty; for such is the uniform description of it in the word of God.\nWhen the Lord speaks thus in Zephaniah, “I will take away out of the midst\nof thee them that rejoice in thy pride; I will also leave in the midst of\nthee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the\nLord;”(1984) does he not clearly show who are truly humble? even such as\nare afflicted with a knowledge of their own poverty. On the contrary, he\ndescribes the proud as persons “rejoicing,” because this is the usual\nconsequence of prosperity. But to the humble, whom he intends to save, he\nleaves nothing but that “they trust in the name of the Lord.” Thus also in\nIsaiah, “To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a\ncontrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.”(1985) Again: “Thus saith the\nhigh and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell\nin the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble\nspirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the\ncontrite ones.”(1986) By the contrition so frequently mentioned, we must\nunderstand a wounded heart, which prevents a man from rising when humbled\nin the dust. With such contrition must our heart be wounded, if we desire,\naccording to the declaration of the Lord, to be exalted with the humble.\nIf this be not the case, we shall be abased by the powerful hand of God to\nour shame and disgrace.(1987)\nVII. And, not content with mere precepts, our excellent Master, in a\nparable, as in a picture, has presented us with an example of genuine\nhumility. For he introduces a publican, who, “standing afar off, would not\nlift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,\nsaying, God be merciful to me a sinner.”(1988) We must not conclude these\ncircumstances—his not presuming to look upwards, standing afar off,\nsmiting upon his breast, and confessing himself a sinner—to be marks of\nfeigned modesty; we may be certain that they were sincere evidences of the\ndisposition of his heart. To him our Lord opposes a Pharisee, who said,\n“God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,\nadulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give\ntithes of all that I possess.” He openly confesses the righteousness which\nhe has, to be the gift of God; but because he confides in his being\nrighteous, he departs from the presence of God unacceptable and hateful to\nhim. The publican, acknowledging his iniquity, is justified. Hence we may\nsee how very pleasing our humiliation is in the sight of God; so that the\nheart is not open for the reception of his mercy unless it be divested of\nall idea of its own dignity. When this notion has occupied the mind, it\nprecludes the admission of Divine mercy. That no one might have any doubt\nof this, Christ was sent by his Father into the world with a commission,\n“to preach good tidings unto the meek; to bind up the broken‐hearted; to\nproclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them\nthat are bound; to comfort all that mourn; to give unto them beauty for\nashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit\nof heaviness.”(1989) In pursuance of this commission, he invites to a\nparticipation of his benefits none but those who “labour and are heavy\nladen.”(1990) And in another place he says, “I am not come to call the\nrighteous, but sinners to repentance.”(1991)\nVIII. Therefore, if we would obey the call of Christ, let us dismiss all\narrogance and carelessness from our minds. The former arises from a\nfoolish persuasion of our own righteousness, when a man supposes himself\nto be possessed of any thing, the merit of which can recommend him to God;\nthe latter may exist without any consideration of works. For multitudes of\nsinners, inebriated with criminal pleasures, and forgetful of the Divine\njudgment, are in a state, as it were, of lethargic insensibility, so that\nthey never aspire after the mercy which is offered to them. But it is\nequally necessary for us to shake off such stupidity, and to reject all\nconfidence in ourselves, in order that, being freed from every\nincumbrance, we may hasten to Christ, all destitute and hungry, to be\nfilled with his blessings. For we shall never have sufficient confidence\nin him, unless we entirely lose all confidence in ourselves; we shall\nnever find sufficient encouragement in him, unless we are previously\ndejected in ourselves; we shall never enjoy sufficient consolation in him,\nunless we are utterly disconsolate in ourselves. We are prepared,\ntherefore, to seek and obtain the grace of God, discarding at the same\ntime all confidence in ourselves, and relying solely on the assurance of\nhis mercy, “when,” as Augustine says, “forgetting our own merits, we\nembrace the free gifts of Christ; because, if he sought merits in us, we\nshould not come to his free gifts.” With him Bernard fully agrees, when he\ncompares proud men, that arrogate ever so little to their own merits, to\nunfaithful servants, because they unjustly claim the praise of the grace\nwhich passes through them; just as though a wall should say that it\nproduces the sunbeams which it receives through a window. But not to dwell\nany longer on this, we may lay it down as a brief, but general and certain\nmaxim, that he is prepared for a participation of the benefits of Divine\nmercy, who has wholly divested himself, I will not say of his\nrighteousness, which is a mere nullity, but of the vain and airy phantom\nof righteousness; for as far as any man is satisfied with himself, so far\nhe raises an impediment to the exercise of the grace of God."

        {
          "title": "Chapter XIII. Two Things Necessary To Be Observed In Gratuitous",
          "content": "Justification.\nHere are two things to which we must always be particularly attentive; to\nmaintain the glory of the Lord unimpaired and undiminished, and to\npreserve in our own consciences a placid composure and serene tranquillity\nwith regard to the Divine judgment. We see how frequently and solicitously\nthe Scripture exhorts us to render ascriptions of praise to God alone,\nwhen it treats of justification. And, indeed, the apostle assures us that\nthe design of the Lord in conferring righteousness upon us in Christ, is\nto manifest his own righteousness. The nature of that manifestation he\nimmediately subjoins: it is, “that he might be just, and the justifier of\nhim which believeth in Jesus.”(1992) The righteousness of God, we see, is\nnot sufficiently illustrious, unless he alone be esteemed righteous, and\ncommunicate the grace of justification to the unworthy. For this reason it\nis his will “that every mouth be stopped, and all the world become guilty\nbefore him;”(1993) because, as long as man has any thing to allege in his\nown defence, it detracts something from the glory of God. Thus in Ezekiel\nhe teaches us how greatly we glorify his name by an acknowledgment of our\niniquity: “Ye shall remember your ways, (saith he,) and all your doings,\nwherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own\nsight for all your evils that ye have committed. And ye shall know that I\nam the Lord, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not\naccording to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt\ndoings.”(1994) If these things are contained in the true knowledge of God,\nthat, humbled with a consciousness of our iniquity, we should consider him\nas indulging us with blessings of which we are unworthy, why do we\nattempt, to our own serious injury, to pilfer the smallest particle of the\npraise due to his gratuitous goodness? Thus also when Jeremiah proclaims,\n“Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man\nglory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him\nthat glorieth glory in the Lord;”(1995) does he not suggest that the glory\nof God sustains some diminution, if any man glory in himself? To this use\nthese words are clearly applied by Paul, when he states, that all the\nbranches of our salvation are deposited with Christ, that we may not glory\nexcept in the Lord.(1996) For he intimates, that they who suppose\nthemselves to have even the least ground for glorying in themselves, are\nguilty of rebelling against God, and obscuring his glory.\nII. The truth, then, is, that we never truly glory in him, till we have\nentirely renounced all glory of our own. On the converse, this may be\nadmitted as an axiom universally true, that they who glory in themselves,\nglory in opposition to God. For Paul is of opinion that the world is not\n“subject to the judgment of God,” till men are deprived of all foundation\nfor glorying.(1997) Therefore Isaiah, when he announces, that “in the Lord\nshall all the seed of Israel be justified,” adds also, “and shall glory;”\nas though he had said, that the end of God in justifying the elect was,\nthat they might glory in himself, and in no other. But how we should glory\nin the Lord, he had stated in the preceding verse: “Surely, shall one say,\nin the Lord have I righteousness and strength.” Let us observe, that what\nis required is not a simple confession, but a confession confirmed by an\noath; that we may not suppose any fictitious pretence of humility to be\nsufficient.(1998) Here let no one plead that he does not glory at all,\nwhen without arrogance he recognizes his own righteousness; for such an\nopinion cannot exist without generating confidence, nor confidence without\nbeing attended with glorying. Let us remember, therefore, in the whole\ncontroversy concerning righteousness, that this end must be kept in view,\nthat all the praise of it may remain perfect and undiminished with the\nLord; because, according to the apostle’s testimony, he has bestowed his\ngrace on us in order “to declare his righteousness; that he might be just,\nand the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.”(1999) Wherefore, in\nanother place, after having declared that the Lord has conferred salvation\non us in order to display “the praise of the glory of his grace,”(2000)\nrepeating, as it were, the same sentiment, he adds, “By grace are ye saved\nthrough faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of\nworks, lest any man should boast.”(2001) And when Peter admonishes us that\nwe are called to the hope of salvation, “that we should show forth the\npraises (or virtues) of him who hath called us out of darkness into his\nmarvellous light,”(2002) he evidently means that the praises of God alone\nshould resound in the ears of believers, so as to impose total silence on\nall the presumption of the flesh. The conclusion of the whole is, that man\ncannot without sacrilege arrogate to himself the least particle of\nrighteousness, because it is so much detracted and diminished from the\nglory of the righteousness of God.\nIII. Now, if we inquire by what means the conscience can obtain peace\nbefore God, we shall find no other than our reception of gratuitous\nrighteousness from his free gift. Let us always remember the inquiry of\nSolomon—“Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my\nsin?”(2003) It is certain that there is no man who is not covered with\ninfinite pollution. Let a man of the most perfect character, then, retire\ninto his own conscience, and enter into a scrutiny of his actions, and\nwhat will be the result? Will he feel a high degree of satisfaction, as\nthough there were the most entire agreement between God and him? or will\nhe not rather be lacerated with terrible agonies, on perceiving in himself\nsuch ample cause for condemnation, if he be judged according to his works?\nIf the conscience reflect on God, it must either enjoy a solid peace with\nhis judgment, or be surrounded with the terrors of hell. We gain nothing,\ntherefore, in our discussions of this point, unless we establish a\nrighteousness, the stability of which will support our souls under the\nscrutiny of the Divine judgment. When our souls shall possess what will\nenable them to appear with boldness in the presence of God, and to await\nand receive his judgment without any fear, then, and not before, we may be\nassured that we have found a righteousness which truly deserves the name.\nIt is not without reason, therefore, that this subject is so largely\ninsisted on by the apostle, whose words I prefer to my own: “For if they\nwhich are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made\nof none effect.”(2004) He first infers, that faith is annulled and\nsuperseded, if the promise of righteousness respect the merit of our\nworks, or depend on our observance of the law. For no man could ever\nsecurely rely on it, since he never would be able to determine with\ncertainty for himself that he had fulfilled the law, as in fact no man\never does completely satisfy it by any works of his own. Not to seek far\nfor testimonies of this fact, every individual may be his own witness of\nit, who will enter unprejudiced into an examination of himself. And hence\nit appears in what deep and dark recesses hypocrisy buries the minds of\nmen, while they indulge themselves in such great security, and hesitate\nnot to oppose their self‐adulation to the judgment of God, as though they\nwould stop the proceedings of his tribunal. But believers, who sincerely\nexamine themselves, are troubled and distressed with a solicitude of a\nvery different nature. The minds of men universally, therefore, ought to\nfeel first hesitation, and then despair, while considering, every one for\nhimself, the magnitude of the debt with which they are still oppressed,\nand their immense distance from the conditions prescribed to them. Behold\ntheir confidence already broken and extinguished; for to confide is not to\nfluctuate, to vary, to be hurried hither and thither, to hesitate, to be\nkept in suspense, to stagger, and finally to despair; but it is, to\nstrengthen the mind with content, certainty, and solid security, and to\nhave somewhat upon which to stand and to rest.\nIV. He adds likewise another consideration, that the promise would be void\nand of none effect. For if the fulfilment of it depend on our merit, when\nshall we have made such a progress as to deserve the favour of God?\nBesides, this second argument is a consequence of the former, since the\npromise will be fulfilled to those alone who shall exercise faith in it.\nTherefore, if faith be wanting, the promise will retain no force.\n“Therefore the inheritance is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the\nend the promise might be sure to all the seed.”(2005) For it is abundantly\nconfirmed, when it depends solely on the Divine mercy; because mercy and\ntruth are connected by an indissoluble bond, and whatever God mercifully\npromises, he also faithfully performs. Thus David, before he implores\nsalvation for himself according to the word of God, first represents it as\noriginating in his mercy: “According to thy word unto thy servant, let thy\ntender mercies come unto me, that I may live.”(2006) And for this there is\nsufficient reason, since God has no other inducement to promise than what\narises from his mere mercy. Here, then, we must place, and, as it were,\ndeeply fix, all our hopes, without regarding our own works, or seeking any\nassistance from them. Nor must it be supposed that we are advancing a new\ndoctrine, for the same conduct is recommended by Augustine. “Christ,” says\nhe, “will reign in his servants for ever. God has promised this, God has\nsaid it; if that be insufficient, God has sworn it. Since the promise,\ntherefore, is established, not according to our merits, but according to\nhis mercy, no man ought to speak with anxiety of that which he cannot\ndoubt.” Bernard also says, “The disciples of Christ asked, Who can be\nsaved? He replied, With men this is impossible, but not with God. This is\nall our confidence, this our only consolation, this the whole foundation\nof our hope. But certain of the possibility, what think we of his will?\nWho knows whether he deserve love or hatred?(2007) Who has known the mind\nof the Lord, or who has been his counsellor?(2008) Here, now, we evidently\nneed faith to help us, and his truth to assist us; that what is concealed\nfrom us in the heart of the Father, may be revealed by the Spirit, and\nthat the testimony of the Spirit may persuade our hearts that we are sons\nof God; that he may persuade us by calling and justifying us freely by\nfaith; in which there is, as it were, an intermediate passage from eternal\npredestination to future glory.” Let us draw the following brief\nconclusion: The Scripture declares that the promises of God have no\nefficacy, unless they be embraced by the conscience with a steady\nconfidence; and whenever there is any doubt or uncertainty, it pronounces\nthem to be made void. Again, it asserts that they have no stability if\nthey depend on our works. Either, therefore, we must be for ever destitute\nof righteousness, or our works must not come into consideration, but the\nground must be occupied by faith alone, whose nature it is to open the\nears and shut the eyes; that is, to be intent only on the promise, and to\navert the thoughts from all human dignity or merit. Thus is accomplished\nthat remarkable prophecy of Zechariah: “I will remove the iniquity of that\nland in one day. In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall ye call every\nman his neighbour under the vine and under the fig‐tree;”(2009) in which\nthe prophet suggests that believers enjoy no true peace till after they\nhave obtained the remission of their sins. For this analogy must be\nobserved in the prophets, that when they treat of the kingdom of Christ,\nthey exhibit the external bounties of God as figures of spiritual\nblessings. Wherefore also Christ is denominated “the Prince of peace,” and\n“our Peace;”(2010) because he calms all the agitations of the conscience.\nIf we inquire, by what means; we must come to the sacrifice by which God\nis appeased. For no man will ever lose his fears who shall not be assured\nthat God is propitiated solely by that atonement which Christ has made by\nsustaining his wrath. In short, we must seek for peace only in the terrors\nof Christ our Redeemer.\nV. But why do I use such an obscure testimony? Paul invariably denies that\npeace or tranquillity can be enjoyed in the conscience, without a\ncertainty that we are justified by faith.(2011) And he also declares\nwhence that certainty proceeds; it is “because the love of God is shed\nabroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost;”(2012) as though he had said that\nour consciences can never be satisfied without a certain persuasion of our\nacceptance with God. Hence he exclaims in the name of all believers, “Who\nshall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ?”(2013) For till\nwe have reached that port of safety, we shall tremble with alarm at every\nslightest breeze; but while God shall manifest himself as our Shepherd, we\nshall fear no evil even in the valley of the shadow of death.(2014)\nWhoever they are, therefore, who pretend that we are justified by faith,\nbecause, being regenerated, we are righteous by living a spiritual life,\nthey have never tasted the sweetness of grace, so as to have confidence\nthat God would be propitious to them. Whence also it follows, that they\nknow no more of the method of praying aright, than the Turks or any other\nprofane nations. For according to the testimony of Paul, faith is not\ngenuine unless it dictate and suggest that most delightful name of Father,\nand unless it open our mouth freely to cry, “Abba, Father;”(2015) which he\nin another place expresses still more clearly: “In Christ we have boldness\nand access with confidence by the faith of him.”(2016) This certainly\narises not from the gift of regeneration; which, being always imperfect in\nthe present state, contains in itself abundant occasion of doubting.\nWherefore it is necessary to come to this remedy; that believers should\nconclude that they cannot hope for an inheritance in the kingdom of heaven\non any other foundation, but because, being ingrafted into the body of\nChrist, they are gratuitously accounted righteous. For with respect to\njustification, faith is a thing merely passive, bringing nothing of our\nown to conciliate the favour of God, but receiving what we need from\nChrist.\nFOOTNOTES\n1 It is not uncommon, among persons of a certain class, to represent\nthe leading principles of Calvin as unfavourable to practical\nreligion, and to that kind of preaching which is adapted to affect\nthe hearts and consciences of the hearers. A reference to the most\nable and intelligent theologians and preachers who have held those\nprinciples, and upon whom they may reasonably be concluded to have\nexerted their genuine and fullest influence, will amply evince the\ninaccuracy of this representation. Of the excellent divine quoted\nabove, King Charles I. was wont to say, that “he carried his ears to\nhear other preachers, but his conscience to hear Mr. Saunderson.”\n2 Prov. xxix. 18.\n3 Dan. ii. 34.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nSection 5.

Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\nThe Project Gutenberg eBook of Institutes of the Christian Religion (Vol. 2 of 2)\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

          "content": "THE COMMENCEMENT AND CONTINUAL PROGRESS OF JUSTIFICATION.\nFor the further elucidation of this subject, let us examine what kind of\nrighteousness can be found in men during the whole course of their\nlives. Let us divide them into four classes. For either they are\ndestitute of the knowledge of God, and immerged in idolatry; or, having\nbeen initiated by the sacraments, they lead impure lives, denying God in\ntheir actions, while they confess him with their lips, and belong to\nChrist only in name; or they are hypocrites, concealing the iniquity of\ntheir hearts with vain disguises; or, being regenerated by the Spirit of\nGod, they devote themselves to true holiness. In the first of these\nclasses, judged of according to their natural characters, from the crown\nof the head to the sole of the foot there will not be found a single\nspark of goodness; unless we mean to charge the Scripture with falsehood\nin these representations which it gives of all the sons of Adam—that\n“the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked;”[1]\nthat “every imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth;”[2] that\n“the thoughts of man are vanity; that there is no fear of God before his\neyes;”[3] that “there is none that understandeth, none that seeketh\nafter God;”[4] in a word, “that he is flesh,”[5] a term expressive of\nall those works which are enumerated by Paul—“adultery, fornication,\nuncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,\nemulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,”[6]\nand every impurity and abomination that can be conceived. This is the\ndignity, in the confidence of which they must glory. But if any among\nthem discover that integrity in their conduct which among men has some\nappearance of sanctity, yet, since we know that God regards not external\nsplendour, we must penetrate to the secret springs of these actions, if\nwe wish them to avail any thing to justification. We must narrowly\nexamine, I say, from what disposition of heart these works proceed.\nThough a most extensive field of observation is now before us, yet,\nsince the subject may be despatched in very few words, I shall be as\ncompendious as possible.\nII. In the first place, I do not deny, that whatever excellences appear\nin unbelievers, they are the gifts of God. I am not so at variance with\nthe common opinion of mankind, as to contend that there is no difference\nbetween the justice, moderation, and equity of Titus or Trajan, and the\nrage, intemperance, and cruelty of Caligula, or Nero, or Domitian;\nbetween the obscenities of Tiberius and the continence of Vespasian;\nand, not to dwell on particular virtues or vices, between the observance\nand the contempt of moral obligation and positive laws. For so great is\nthe difference between just and unjust, that it is visible even in the\nlifeless image of it. For what order will be left in the world, if these\nopposites be confounded together? Such a distinction as this, therefore,\nbetween virtuous and vicious actions, has not only been engraven by the\nLord in the heart of every man, but has also been frequently confirmed\nby his providential dispensations. We see how he confers many blessings\nof the present life on those who practise virtue among men. Not that\nthis external resemblance of virtue merits the least favour from him;\nbut he is pleased to discover his great esteem of true righteousness, by\nnot permitting that which is external and hypocritical to remain without\na temporal reward. Whence it follows, as we have just acknowledged, that\nthese virtues, whatever they may be, or rather images of virtues, are\nthe gifts of God; since there is nothing in any respect laudable which\ndoes not proceed from him.\nIII. Nevertheless the observation of Augustine is strictly true—that all\nwho are strangers to the religion of the one true God, however they may\nbe esteemed worthy of admiration for their reputed virtue, not only\nmerit no reward, but are rather deserving of punishment, because they\ncontaminate the pure gifts of God with the pollution of their own\nhearts. For though they are instruments used by God for the preservation\nof human society, by the exercise of justice, continence, friendship,\ntemperance, fortitude, and prudence, yet they perform these good works\nof God very improperly; being restrained from the commission of evil,\nnot by a sincere attachment to true virtue, but either by mere ambition,\nor by self-love, or by some other irregular disposition. These actions,\ntherefore, being corrupted in their very source by the impurity of their\nhearts, are no more entitled to be classed among virtues, than those\nvices which commonly deceive mankind by their affinity and similitude to\nvirtues. Besides, when we remember that the end of what is right is\nalways to serve God, whatever is directed to any other end, can have no\nclaim to that appellation. Therefore, since they regard not the end\nprescribed by Divine wisdom, though an act performed by them be\nexternally and apparently good, yet, being directed to a wrong end, it\nbecomes sin. He concludes, therefore, that all the Fabricii, Scipios,\nand Catos, in all their celebrated actions, were guilty of sin, inasmuch\nas, being destitute of the light of faith, they did not direct those\nactions to that end to which they ought to have directed them; that\nconsequently they had no genuine righteousness; because moral duties are\nestimated not by external actions, but by the ends for which such\nactions are designed.\nIV. Besides, if there be any truth in the assertion of John, that “he\nthat hath not the Son of God, hath not life;”[7] they who have no\ninterest in Christ, whatever be their characters, their actions, or\ntheir endeavours, are constantly advancing, through the whole course of\ntheir lives, towards destruction and the sentence of eternal death. On\nthis argument is founded the following observation of Augustine: “Our\nreligion discriminates between the righteous and the unrighteous, not by\nthe law of works, but by that of faith, without which works apparently\ngood are perverted into sins.” Wherefore the same writer, in another\nplace, strikingly compares the exertions of such men to a deviation in a\nrace from the prescribed course. For the more vigorously any one runs\nout of the way, he recedes so much the further from the goal, and\nbecomes so much the more unfortunate. Wherefore he contends, that it is\nbetter to halt in the way, than to run out of the way. Finally, it is\nevident that they are evil trees, since without a participation of\nChrist there is no sanctification. They may produce fruits fair and\nbeautiful to the eye, and even sweet to the taste, but never any that\nare good. Hence we clearly perceive that all the thoughts, meditations,\nand actions of man, antecedent to a reconciliation to God by faith, are\naccursed, and not only of no avail to justification, but certainly\ndeserving of condemnation. But why do we dispute concerning it as a\ndubious point, when it is already proved by the testimony of the\napostle, that “without faith it is impossible to please God?”[8]\nV. But the proof will be still clearer, if the grace of God be directly\nopposed to the natural condition of man. The Scripture invariably\nproclaims, that God finds nothing in men which can incite him to bless\nthem, but that he prevents them by his gratuitous goodness. For what can\na dead man do to recover life? But when God illuminates us with the\nknowledge of himself, he is said to raise us from death, and to make us\nnew creatures.[9] For under this character we find the Divine goodness\ntowards us frequently celebrated, especially by the apostle. “God,” says\nhe, “who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,\neven when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ,”\n&c.[10] In another place, when, under the type of Abraham, he treats of\nthe general calling of believers, he says, It is “God, who quickeneth\nthe dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they\nwere.”[11] If we are nothing, what can we do? Wherefore God forcibly\nrepresses this presumption, in the Book of Job, in the following words:\n“Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the\nwhole heaven is mine.”[12] Paul, explaining this passage, concludes from\nit, that we ought not to suppose we bring any thing to the Lord but\nignominious indigence and emptiness.[13] Wherefore, in the passage cited\nabove, in order to prove that we attain to the hope of salvation, not by\nworks, but solely by the grace of God, he alleges, that “we are his\nworkmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath\nbefore ordained that we should walk in them.”[14] As though he would\nsay, Who of us can boast that he has influenced God by his\nrighteousness, since our first power to do well proceeds from\nregeneration? For, according to the constitution of our nature, oil\nmight be extracted from a stone sooner than we could perform a good\nwork. It is wonderful, indeed, that man, condemned to such ignominy,\ndares to pretend to have any thing left. Let us confess, therefore, with\nthat eminent servant of the Lord, that “God hath saved us, and called us\nwith a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his\nown purpose and grace;”[15] and that “the kindness and love of God our\nSaviour towards man appeared,” because “not by works of righteousness\nwhich we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us; that being\njustified by his grace, we should be made heirs of eternal life.”[16] By\nthis confession we divest man of all righteousness, even to the smallest\nparticle, till through mere mercy he has been regenerated to the hope of\neternal life; for if a righteousness of works contributed any thing to\nour justification, we are not truly said to be “justified by grace.” The\napostle, when he asserted justification to be by grace, had certainly\nnot forgotten his argument in another place, that “if it be of works,\nthen it is no more grace.”[17] And what else does our Lord intend, when\nhe declares, “I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners?”[18] If\nsinners only are admitted, why do we seek to enter by a counterfeit\nrighteousness?\nVI. The same thought frequently recurs to me, that I am in danger of\ninjuring the mercy of God, by labouring with so much anxiety in the\ndefence of this doctrine, as though it were doubtful or obscure. But\nsuch being our malignity, that, unless it be most powerfully subdued, it\nnever allows to God that which belongs to him, I am constrained to dwell\na little longer upon it. But as the Scripture is sufficiently\nperspicuous on this subject, I shall use its language in preference to\nmy own. Isaiah, after having described the universal ruin of mankind,\nproperly subjoins the method of recovery. “The Lord saw it, and it\ndispleased him that there was no judgment. And he saw that there was no\nman, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm\nbrought salvation unto him; and his righteousness it sustained him.”[19]\nWhere are our righteousnesses, if it be true, as the prophet says, that\nno one assists the Lord in procuring his salvation? So another prophet\nintroduces the Lord speaking of the reconciliation of sinners to\nhimself, saying, “I will betroth thee unto me for ever, in\nrighteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.\nI will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy.”[20] If this\ncovenant, which is evidently our first union with God, depend on his\nmercy, there remains no foundation for our righteousness. And I should\nreally wish to be informed by those, who pretend that man advances to\nmeet God with some righteousness of works, whether there be any\nrighteousness at all, but that which is accepted by God. If it be\nmadness to entertain such a thought, what that is acceptable to God can\nproceed from his enemies, who, with all their actions, are the objects\nof his complete abhorrence? And that we are all the inveterate and\navowed enemies of our God, till we are justified and received into his\nfriendship, is an undeniable truth.[21] If justification be the\nprinciple from which love originates, what righteousnesses of works can\nprecede it? To destroy that pestilent arrogance, therefore, John\ncarefully apprizes us that “we did not first love him.”[22] And the Lord\nhad by his prophet long before taught the same truth: “I will love them\nfreely,” saith he, “for mine anger is turned away.”[23] If his love was\nspontaneously inclined towards us, it certainly is not excited by works.\nBut the ignorant mass of mankind have only this notion of it—that no man\nhas merited that Christ should effect our redemption; but that towards\nobtaining the possession of redemption, we derive some assistance from\nour own works. But however we may have been redeemed by Christ, yet till\nwe are introduced into communion with him by the calling of the Father,\nwe are both heirs of darkness and death, and enemies to God. For Paul\nteaches, that we are not purified and washed from our pollutions by the\nblood of Christ, till the Spirit effects that purification within\nus.[24] This is the same that Peter intends, when he declares that the\n“sanctification of the Spirit” is effectual “unto obedience, and\nsprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.”[25] If we are sprinkled by the\nSpirit with the blood of Christ for purification, we must not imagine\nthat before this ablution we are in any other state than that of sinners\ndestitute of Christ. We may be certain, therefore, that the commencement\nof our salvation is, as it were, a resurrection from death to life;\nbecause, when “on the behalf of Christ it is given to us to believe on\nhim,”[26] we then begin to experience a transition from death to life.\nVII. The same reasoning may be applied to the second and third classes\nof men in the division stated above. For the impurity of the conscience\nproves, that they are neither of them yet regenerated by the Spirit of\nGod; and their unregeneracy betrays also their want of faith: whence it\nappears, that they are not yet reconciled to God, or justified in his\nsight, since these blessings are only attained by faith. What can be\nperformed by sinners alienated from God, that is not execrable in his\nview? Yet all the impious, and especially hypocrites, are inflated with\nthis foolish confidence. Though they know that their heart is full of\nimpurity, yet if they perform any specious actions, they esteem them too\ngood to be despised by God. Hence that pernicious error, that though\nconvicted of a polluted and impious heart, they cannot be brought to\nconfess themselves destitute of righteousness; but while they\nacknowledge themselves to be unrighteous, because it cannot be denied,\nthey still arrogate to themselves some degree of righteousness. This\nvanity the Lord excellently refutes by the prophet. “Ask now,” saith he,\n“the priests, saying, If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his\ngarment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or any meat, shall it be\nholy? And the priests answered and said, No. Then said Haggai, If one\nthat is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?\nAnd the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean. Then answered\nHaggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me,\nsaith the Lord; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they\noffer there is unclean.”[27] I wish that this passage might either\nobtain full credit with us, or be deeply impressed on our memory. For\nthere is no one, however flagitious his whole life may be, who can\nsuffer himself to be persuaded of what the Lord here plainly declares.\nThe greatest sinner, as soon as he has performed two or three duties of\nthe law, doubts not but they are accepted of him for righteousness; but\nthe Lord positively denies that any sanctification is acquired by such\nactions, unless the heart be previously well purified; and not content\nwith this, he asserts that all the works of sinners are contaminated by\nthe impurity of their hearts. Let the name of righteousness, then, no\nlonger be given to these works which are condemned for their pollution\nby the lips of God. And by what a fine similitude does he demonstrate\nthis! For it might have been objected that what the Lord had enjoined\nwas inviolably holy. But he shows, on the contrary, that it is not to be\nwondered at, if those things which are sanctified by the law of the\nLord, are defiled by the pollution of the wicked; since an unclean hand\ncannot touch any thing that has been consecrated, without profaning it.\nVIII. He excellently pursues the same argument also in Isaiah: “Bring no\nmore vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; your new moons\nand your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I\nam weary to bear them. When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine\neyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your\nhands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of\nyour doings.”[28] What is the reason that the Lord is so displeased at\nan obedience to his law? But, in fact, he here rejects nothing that\narises from the genuine observance of the law; the beginning of which,\nhe every where teaches, is an unfeigned fear of his name.[29] If that be\nwanting, all the oblations made to him are not merely trifles, but\nnauseous and abominable pollutions. Let hypocrites go now, and,\nretaining depravity concealed in their hearts, endeavour by their works\nto merit the favour of God. But by such means they will add provocation\nto provocation; for “the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to\nthe Lord; but the prayer of the upright” alone “is his delight.”[30] We\nlay it down, therefore, as an undoubted truth, which ought to be well\nknown to such as are but moderately versed in the Scriptures, that even\nthe most splendid works of men not yet truly sanctified, are so far from\nrighteousness in the Divine view, that they are accounted sins. And\ntherefore they have strictly adhered to the truth, who have maintained\nthat the works of a man do not conciliate God’s favour to his person;\nbut, on the contrary, that works are never acceptable to God, unless the\nperson who performs them has previously found favour in his sight. And\nthis order, to which the Scripture directs us, is religiously to be\nobserved. Moses relates, that “The Lord had respect unto Abel and to his\noffering.”[31] Does he not plainly indicate that the Lord is propitious\nto men, before he regards their works? Wherefore the purification of the\nheart is a necessary prerequisite, in order that the works which we\nperform may be favourably received by God; for the declaration of\nJeremiah is always in force, that the “eyes of the Lord are upon the\ntruth.”[32] And the Holy Spirit has asserted by the mouth of Peter, that\nit is “by faith” alone that the “heart” is “purified,”[33] which proves\nthat the first foundation is laid in a true and living faith.\nIX. Let us now examine what degree of righteousness is possessed by\nthose whom we have ranked in the fourth class. We admit, that when God,\nby the interposition of the righteousness of Christ, reconciles us to\nhimself, and having granted us the free remission of our sins, esteems\nus as righteous persons, to this mercy he adds also another blessing;\nfor he dwells in us by his Holy Spirit, by whose power our carnal\ndesires are daily more and more mortified, and we are sanctified, that\nis, consecrated to the Lord unto real purity of life, having our hearts\nmoulded to obey his law, so that it is our prevailing inclination to\nsubmit to his will, and to promote his glory alone by all possible\nmeans. But even while, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we are\nwalking in the ways of the Lord,—that we may not forget ourselves, and\nbe filled with pride, we feel such remains of imperfection, as afford us\nabundant cause for humility. The Scripture declares, that “there is not\na just man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.”[34] What kind\nof righteousness, then, will even believers obtain from their own works?\nIn the first place, I assert, that the best of their performances are\ntarnished and corrupted by some carnal impurity and debased by a mixture\nof some alloy. Let any holy servant of God select from his whole life\nthat which he shall conceive to have been the best of all his actions,\nand let him examine it with attention on every side; he will undoubtedly\ndiscover in it some taint of the corruption of the flesh; since our\nalacrity to good actions is never what it ought to be, but our course is\nretarded by great debility. Though we perceive that the blemishes which\ndeform the works of the saints, are not difficult to be discovered, yet\nsuppose we admit them to be very diminutive spots, will they not be at\nall offensive in the sight of God, in which even the stars are not pure?\nWe have now ascertained, that there is not a single action performed by\nthe saints, which, if judged according to its intrinsic merit, does not\njustly deserve to be rewarded with shame.\nX. In the next place, even though it were possible for us to perform any\nworks completely pure and perfect, yet one sin is sufficient to\nextinguish and annihilate all remembrance of antecedent righteousness,\nas is declared by the prophet.[35] With him James also agrees:\n“Whosoever shall offend,” says he, “in one point, he is guilty of\nall.”[36] Now, since this mortal life is never pure or free from sin,\nwhatever righteousness we might acquire being perpetually corrupted,\noverpowered, and destroyed by subsequent sins, it would neither be\nadmitted in the sight of God, nor be imputed to us for righteousness.\nLastly, in considering the righteousness of works, we should regard, not\nany action commanded in the law, but the commandment itself. Therefore,\nif we seek righteousness by the law, it is in vain for us to perform two\nor three works; a perpetual observance of the law is indispensably\nnecessary. Wherefore God does not impute to us for righteousness that\nremission of sins, of which we have spoken, once only, (as some\nfoolishly imagine,) in order that, having obtained pardon for our past\nlives, we may afterwards seek righteousness by the law; which would be\nonly sporting with us, and deluding us by a fallacious hope. For since\nperfection is unattainable by us, as long as we are in this mortal body,\nand the law denounces death and judgment on all whose works are not\ncompletely and universally righteous, it will always have matter of\naccusation and condemnation against us, unless it be prevented by the\nDivine mercy continually absolving us by a perpetual remission of our\nsins. Wherefore it will ever be true, as we asserted at the beginning,\nthat if we be judged according to our demerits, whatever be our designs\nor undertakings, we are nevertheless with all our endeavours and all our\npursuits, deserving of death and destruction.\nXI. We must strenuously insist on these two points—first, that there\nnever was an action performed by a pious man, which, if examined by the\nscrutinizing eye of Divine justice, would not deserve condemnation; and\nsecondly, if any such thing be admitted, (though it cannot be the case\nwith any individual of mankind,) yet being corrupted and contaminated by\nthe sins, of which its performer is confessedly guilty, it loses every\nclaim to the Divine favour. And this is the principal hinge on which our\ncontroversy [with the Papists] turns. For concerning the beginning of\njustification, there is no dispute between us and the sounder schoolmen,\nbut we all agree, that a sinner being freely delivered from condemnation\nobtains righteousness, and that by the remission of his sins; only they,\nunder the term _justification_, comprehend that renovation in which we\nare renewed by the Spirit of God to an obedience to the law, and so they\ndescribe the righteousness of a regenerate man as consisting in\nthis—that a man, after having been once reconciled to God through faith\nin Christ, is accounted righteous with God on account of his good works,\nthe merit of which is the cause of his acceptance. But the Lord, on the\ncontrary, declares, “that faith was reckoned to Abraham for\nrighteousness,”[37] not during the time while he yet remained a\nworshipper of idols, but after he had been eminent during many years for\nthe sanctity of his life. Abraham, then, had for a long time worshipped\nGod from a pure heart, and performed all that obedience to the law,\nwhich a mortal man is capable of performing; yet, after all, his\nrighteousness consisted in faith. Whence we conclude, according to the\nargument of Paul, that it was not of works. So when the prophet says,\n“The just shall live by his faith,”[38] he is not speaking of the\nimpious and profane, whom the Lord justifies by converting them to the\nfaith; but his address is directed to believers, and they are promised\nlife by faith. Paul also removes every doubt, when, in confirmation of\nthis sentiment, he adduces the following passage of David: “Blessed are\nthey whose iniquities are forgiven.”[39] But it is certain that David\nspake not of impious men, but of believers, whose characters resembled\nhis own; for he spoke from the experience of his own conscience.\nWherefore it is necessary for us, not to have this blessing for once\nonly, but to retain it as long as we live. Lastly, he asserts, that the\nmessage of a free reconciliation with God, is not only promulgated for a\nday or two, but is perpetual in the church.[40] Believers, therefore,\neven to the end of their lives, have no other righteousness than that\nwhich is there described. For the mediatorial office is perpetually\nsustained by Christ, by whom the Father is reconciled to us; and the\nefficacy of whose death is perpetually the same, consisting in ablution,\nsatisfaction, expiation, and perfect obedience, which covers all our\niniquities. And Paul does not tell the Ephesians that they are indebted\nto grace merely for the beginning of their salvation, but that they “are\nsaved by grace, not of works, lest any man should boast.”[41]\nXII. The subterfuges, by which the schoolmen endeavour to evade these\narguments, are unavailing. They say, that the sufficiency of good works\nto justification arises not from their intrinsic merit, but from the\ngrace through which they are accepted. Secondly, because they are\nconstrained to acknowledge the righteousness of works to be always\nimperfect in the present state, they admit, that as long as we live we\nneed the remission of our sins, in order to supply the defects of our\nworks; but that our deficiencies are compensated by works of\nsupererogation. I reply, that what they denominate the grace through\nwhich our works are accepted, is no other than the free goodness of the\nFather, with which he embraces us in Christ, when he invests us with the\nrighteousness of Christ, and accepts it as ours, in order that, in\nconsequence of it, he may treat us as holy, pure, and righteous persons.\nFor the righteousness of Christ (which, being the only perfect\nrighteousness, is the only one that can bear the Divine scrutiny) must\nbe produced on our behalf, and judicially presented, as in the case of a\nsurety. Being furnished with this, we obtain by faith the perpetual\nremission of our sins. Our imperfections and impurities, being concealed\nby its purity, are not imputed to us, but are as it were buried, and\nprevented from appearing in the view of Divine justice, till the advent\nof that hour, when the old man being slain and utterly annihilated in\nus, the Divine goodness shall receive us into a blessed peace with the\nnew Adam, in that state to wait for the day of the Lord, when we shall\nreceive incorruptible bodies, and be translated to the glories of the\ncelestial kingdom.\nXIII. If these things are true, surely no works of ours can render us\nacceptable to God; nor can the actions themselves be pleasing to him,\nany otherwise than as a man, who is covered with the righteousness of\nChrist, pleases God and obtains the remission of his sins. For God has\nnot promised eternal life as a reward of certain works; he only\ndeclares, that “he that doeth these things shall live,”[42] denouncing,\non the contrary, that memorable curse against all who continue not in\nthe observance of every one of his commands.[43] This abundantly refutes\nthe erroneous notion of a partial righteousness, since no other\nrighteousness is admitted into heaven but an entire observance of the\nlaw. Nor is there any more solidity in their pretence of a sufficient\ncompensation for imperfections by works of supererogation. For are they\nnot by this perpetually recurring to the subterfuge, from which they\nhave already been driven, that the partial observance of the law\nconstitutes, as far as it goes, a righteousness of works? They\nunblushingly assume as granted, what no man of sound judgment will\nconcede. The Lord frequently declares, that he acknowledges no\nrighteousness of works, except in a perfect obedience to his law. What\npresumption is it for us, who are destitute of this, in order that we\nmay not appear to be despoiled of all our glory, or, in other words, to\nsubmit entirely to the Lord—what presumption is it for us to boast of I\nknow not what fragments of a few actions, and to endeavour to supply\ndeficiencies by other satisfactions! _Satisfactions_ have already been\nso completely demolished, that they ought not to occupy even a transient\nthought. I only remark, that those who trifle in this manner, do not\nconsider what an execrable thing sin is in the sight of God; for indeed\nthey ought to know, that all the righteousness of all mankind,\naccumulated in one mass, is insufficient to compensate for a single sin.\nWe see that man on account of one offence was rejected and abandoned by\nGod, so that he lost all means of regaining salvation.[44] They are\ndeprived, therefore, of the power of satisfaction, with which, however\nthey flatter themselves, they will certainly never be able to render a\nsatisfaction to God, to whom nothing will be pleasing or acceptable that\nproceeds from his enemies. Now, his enemies are all those to whom he\ndetermines to impute sin. Our sins, therefore, must be covered and\nforgiven, before the Lord can regard any of our works. Whence it follows\nthat the remission of sins is absolutely gratuitous, and that it is\nwickedly blasphemed by those who obtrude any _satisfactions_. Let us,\ntherefore, after the example of the apostle, “forgetting those things\nwhich are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,\npress toward the mark for the prize of our high calling.”[45]\nXIV. But how is the pretence of works of supererogation consistent with\nthis injunction—“When ye shall have done all those things which are\ncommanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that\nwhich was our duty to do?”[46] This direction does not inculcate an act\nof simulation or falsehood, but a decision in our mind respecting that\nof which we are certain. The Lord, therefore, commands us sincerely to\nthink and consider with ourselves, that our services to him are none of\nthem gratuitous, but merely the performance of indispensable duties; and\nthat justly; for we are servants under such numerous obligations as we\ncould never discharge; even though all our thoughts and all our members\nwere devoted to the duties of the law. In saying, therefore, “When ye\nshall have done all those things which are commanded,” he supposes a\ncase of one man having attained to a degree of righteousness beyond what\nis attained by all the men in the world. How, then, while every one of\nus is at the greatest distance from this point, can we presume to glory\nthat we have completely attained to that perfect standard? Nor can any\none reasonably object, that there is nothing to prevent his efforts from\ngoing beyond his necessary obligations, who in any respect fails of\ndoing the duty incumbent on him. For we must acknowledge, that we cannot\nimagine any thing pertaining either to the service of God or to the love\nof our neighbour, which is not comprehended in the Divine law. But if it\nis a part of the law, let us not boast of voluntary liberality, where we\nare bound by necessity.\nXV. It is irrelevant to this subject, to allege the boasting of\nPaul,[47] that among the Corinthians he voluntarily receded from what,\nif he had chosen, he might have claimed as his right, and not only did\nwhat was incumbent on him to do, but afforded them his gratuitous\nservices beyond the requisitions of duty. They ought to attend to the\nreason there assigned, that he acted thus, “lest he should hinder the\ngospel of Christ.”[48] For wicked and fraudulent teachers recommended\nthemselves by this stratagem of liberality, by which they endeavoured,\nboth to conciliate a favourable reception to their own pernicious\ndogmas, and to fix an odium on the gospel; so that Paul was necessitated\neither to endanger the doctrine of Christ, or to oppose these artifices.\nNow, if it be a matter of indifference to a Christian to incur an\noffence when he may avoid it, I confess that the apostle performed for\nthe Lord a work of supererogation; but if this was justly required of a\nprudent minister of the gospel, I maintain that he did what was his duty\nto do. Even if no such reason appeared, yet the observation of\nChrysostom is always true—that all that we have is on the same tenure as\nthe possessions of slaves, which the law pronounces to be the property\nof their masters. And Christ has clearly delivered the same truth in the\nparable, where he inquires whether we thank a servant, when he returns\nhome in the evening, after the various labours of the day.[49] But it is\npossible that he may have laboured with greater diligence than we had\nventured to require. This may be granted; yet he has done no more than,\nby the condition of servitude, he was under an obligation to do; since\nhe belongs to us, with all the ability he has. I say nothing of the\nnature of the supererogations which these men wish to boast of before\nGod; for they are contemptible trifles, which he has never commanded,\nwhich he does not approve, nor, when they render up their account to\nhim, will he accept them. We cannot admit that there are any works of\nsupererogation, except such as those of which it is said by the prophet,\n“Who hath required this at your hand?”[50] But let them remember the\nlanguage of another passage respecting these things: “Wherefore do ye\nspend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which\nsatisfieth not?”[51] It is easy, indeed, for these idle doctors to\ndispute concerning these things in easy chairs; but when the Judge of\nall shall ascend the judgment seat, all such empty notions must vanish\naway. The object of our inquiries ought to be, what plea we may bring\nforward with confidence at his tribunal, not what we can invent in\nschools and cloisters.\nXVI. On this subject our minds require to be guarded chiefly against two\npernicious principles—That we place no confidence in the righteousness\nof our works, and that we ascribe no glory to them. The Scriptures every\nwhere drive us from all confidence, when they declare that all our\nrighteousnesses are odious in the Divine view, unless they are perfumed\nwith the holiness of Christ; and that they can only excite the vengeance\nof God, unless they are supported by his merciful pardon. Thus they\nleave us nothing to do, but to deprecate the wrath of our Judge with the\nconfession of David, “Enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in\nthy sight shall no man living be justified.”[52] And where Job says, “If\nI be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up\nmy head;”[53] though he refers to that consummate righteousness of God,\ncompared to which even the angels are deficient, yet he at the same time\nshows, that when God comes to judgment, all men must be dumb. For he not\nonly means that he would rather freely recede, than incur the danger of\ncontending with the rigour of God, but signifies that he experiences in\nhimself no other righteousness than what would instantaneously vanish\nbefore the Divine presence. When confidence is destroyed, all boasting\nmust of necessity be relinquished. For who can give the praise of\nrighteousness to his works, in which he is afraid to confide in the\npresence of God? We must therefore have recourse to the Lord, in whom we\nare assured, by Isaiah, that “all the seed of Israel shall be justified,\nand shall glory;”[54] for it is strictly true, as he says in another\nplace, that we are “the planting of the Lord, that he might be\nglorified.”[55] Our minds therefore will then be properly purified, when\nthey shall in no degree confide nor glory in our works. But foolish men\nare led into such a false and delusive confidence, by the error of\nalways considering their works as the cause of their salvation.\nXVII. But if we advert to the four kinds of causes, which the\nphilosophers direct us to consider in the production of effects, we\nshall find none of them consistent with works in the accomplishment of\nour salvation. For the Scripture every where proclaims, that the\nefficient cause of eternal life being procured for us, was the mercy of\nour heavenly Father, and his gratuitous love towards us; that the\nmaterial cause is Christ and his obedience, by which he obtained a\nrighteousness for us; and what shall we denominate the formal and\ninstrumental cause, unless it be faith? These three John comprehends in\none sentence, when he says, that “God so loved the world that he gave\nhis only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not\nperish, but have everlasting life.”[56] The final cause the apostle\ndeclares to be, both the demonstration of the Divine righteousness and\nthe praise of the Divine goodness, in a passage in which he also\nexpressly mentions the other three causes. For this is his language to\nthe Romans: “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being\njustified freely by his grace:”[57] here we have the original source of\nour salvation, which is the gratuitous mercy of God towards us. It\nfollows, “through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:” here we have\nthe matter of our justification. “Through faith in his blood:” here he\npoints out the instrumental cause, by which the righteousness of Christ\nis revealed to us. Lastly, he subjoins the end of all, when he says, “To\ndeclare his righteousness; that he might be just, and the justifier of\nhim which believeth in Jesus.” And to suggest, by the way, that this\nrighteousness consists in reconciliation or propitiation, he expressly\nasserts that Christ was “set forth to be a propitiation.” So also in the\nfirst chapter to the Ephesians, he teaches that we are received into the\nfavour of God through his mere mercy; that it is accomplished by the\nmediation of Christ; that it is apprehended by faith; and that the end\nof all is, that the glory of the Divine goodness may be fully\ndisplayed.[58] When we see that every part of our salvation is\naccomplished without us, what reason have we to confide or to glory in\nour works? Nor can even the most inveterate enemies of Divine grace\nraise any controversy with us concerning the efficient or the final\ncause, unless they mean altogether to renounce the authority of the\nScripture. Over the material and formal causes they superinduce a false\ncolouring; as if our own works were to share the honour of them with\nfaith and the righteousness of Christ. But this also is contradicted by\nthe Scripture, which affirms that Christ is the sole author of our\nrighteousness and life, and that this blessing of righteousness is\nenjoyed by faith alone.\nXVIII. The saints often confirm and console themselves with the\nremembrance of their own innocence and integrity, and sometimes even\nrefrain not from proclaiming it. Now, this is done for two reasons;\neither that, in comparing their good cause with the bad cause of the\nimpious, they derive from such comparison an assurance of victory, not\nso much by the commendation of their own righteousness, as by the just\nand merited condemnation of their adversaries; or that, even without any\ncomparison with others, while they examine themselves before God, the\npurity of their consciences affords them some consolation and\nconfidence. To the former of these reasons we shall advert hereafter;\nlet us now briefly examine the consistency of the latter with what we\nhave before asserted, that in the sight of God we ought to place no\nreliance on the merit of works, nor glory on account of them. The\nconsistency appears in this—that for the foundation and accomplishment\nof their salvation, the saints look to the Divine goodness alone,\nwithout any regard to works. And they not only apply themselves to it\nabove all things, as the commencement of their happiness, but likewise\ndepend upon it as the consummation of their felicity. A conscience thus\nfounded, built up, and established, is also confirmed by the\nconsideration of works; that is, as far as they are evidences of God\ndwelling and reigning in us. Now, this confidence of works being found\nin none but those who have previously cast all the confidence of their\nsouls on the mercy of God, it ought not to be thought contrary to that\nupon which it depends. Wherefore, when we exclude the confidence of\nworks, we only mean that the mind of a Christian should not be directed\nto any merit of works as a mean of salvation; but should altogether rely\non the gratuitous promise of righteousness. We do not forbid him to\nsupport and confirm this faith by marks of the Divine benevolence to\nhim. For if, when we call to remembrance the various gifts which God has\nconferred on us, they are all as so many rays from the Divine\ncountenance, by which we are illuminated to contemplate the full blaze\nof supreme goodness,—much more the grace of good works, which\ndemonstrates that we have received the Spirit of adoption.\nXIX. When the saints, therefore, confirm their faith, or derive matter\nof rejoicing from the integrity of their consciences, they only\nconclude, from the fruits of vocation, that they have been adopted by\nthe Lord as his children. The declaration of Solomon, that “In the fear\nof the Lord is strong confidence;”[59] and the protestation sometimes\nused by the saints to obtain a favourable audience from the Lord, that\n“they have walked before” him “in truth and with a perfect heart;”[60]\nthese things have no concern in laying the foundation for establishing\nthe conscience; nor are they of any value, except as they are\nconsequences of the Divine vocation. For there nowhere exists that fear\nof God which can establish a full assurance, and the saints are\nconscious that their integrity is yet accompanied with many relics of\ncorruption. But as the fruits of regeneration evince that the Holy\nSpirit dwells in them, this affords them ample encouragement to expect\nthe assistance of God in all their necessities, because they experience\nhim to be their Father in an affair of such vast importance. And even\nthis they cannot attain, unless they have first apprehended the Divine\ngoodness, confirmed by no other assurance but that of the promise. For\nif they begin to estimate it by their good works, nothing will be weaker\nor more uncertain; for, if their works be estimated in themselves, their\nimperfection will menace them with the wrath of God, as much as their\npurity, however incomplete, testifies his benevolence. In a word, they\ndeclare the benefits of God, but in such a way as not to turn away from\nhis gratuitous favour, in which Paul assures us there is “length, and\nbreadth, and depth, and height;” as though he had said, Which way soever\nthe pious turn their views, how high soever they ascend, how widely\nsoever they expatiate, yet they ought not to go beyond the love of\nChrist, but employ themselves wholly in meditating on it, because it\ncomprehends in itself all dimensions. Therefore he says that it “passeth\nknowledge,” and that when we know how much Christ has loved us, we are\n“filled with all the fulness of God.”[61] So also in another place, when\nhe glories that believers are victorious in every conflict, he\nimmediately adds, as the reason of it, “through him that loved us.”[62]\nXX. We see now, that the confidence which the saints have in their works\nis not such as either ascribes any thing to the merit of them, (since\nthey view them only as the gifts of God, in which they acknowledge his\ngoodness, and as marks of their calling, whence they infer their\nelection,) or derogates the least from the gratuitous righteousness\nwhich we obtain in Christ; since it depends upon it, and cannot subsist\nwithout it. This is concisely and beautifully represented by Augustine,\nwhen he says, “I do not say to the Lord, Despise not the works of my\nhands. I have sought the Lord with my hands, and I have not been\ndeceived. But I commend not the works of my hands; for I fear that when\nthou hast examined them, thou wilt find more sin than merit. This only I\nsay, this I ask, this I desire; Despise not the works of thy hands.\nBehold in me thy work, not mine. For if thou beholdest mine, thou\ncondemnest me; if thou beholdest thine own, thou crownest me. Because\nwhatever good works I have, they are from thee.” He assigns two reasons\nwhy he ventured not to boast of his works to God; first, that if he has\nany good ones, he sees nothing of his own in them; secondly, that even\nthese are buried under a multitude of sins. Hence the conscience\nexperiences more fear and consternation than security. Therefore he\ndesires God to behold his best performances, only that he may recognize\nin them the grace of his own calling, and perfect the work which he has\nbegun.\nXXI. The remaining objection is, that the Scripture represents the good\nworks of believers as the causes for which the Lord blesses them. But\nthis must be understood so as not to affect what we have before proved,\nthat the efficient cause of our salvation is the love of God the Father;\nthe material cause, the obedience of the Son; the instrumental cause,\nthe illumination of the Spirit, that is, faith; and the final cause, the\nglory of the infinite goodness of God. No obstacle arises from these\nthings to prevent good works being considered by the Lord as inferior\ncauses. But how does this happen? Because those whom his mercy has\ndestined to the inheritance of eternal life, he, in his ordinary\ndispensations, introduces to the possession of it by good works. That\nwhich, in the order of his dispensations, precedes, he denominates the\ncause of that which follows. For this reason he sometimes deduces\neternal life from works; not that the acceptance of it is to be referred\nto them; but because he justifies the objects of his election, that he\nmay finally glorify them; he makes the former favour, which is a step to\nthe succeeding one, in some sense the cause of it. But whenever the true\ncause is to be assigned, he does not direct us to take refuge in works,\nbut confines our thoughts entirely to his mercy. For what does he teach\nus by the apostle? “The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is\neternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Why does he not oppose\nrighteousness to sin, as well as life to death? Why does he not make\nrighteousness the cause of life, as well as sin the cause of death? For\nthen the antithesis would have been complete, whereas by this variation\nit is partly destroyed. But the apostle intended by this comparison to\nexpress a certain truth—that death is due to the demerits of men, and\nthat life proceeds solely from the mercy of God. Lastly, these phrases\ndenote rather the order of the Divine gifts, than the cause of them. In\nthe accumulation of graces upon graces, God derives from the former a\nreason for adding the next, that he may not omit any thing necessary to\nthe enrichment of his servants. And while he thus pursues his\nliberality, he would have us always to remember his gratuitous election,\nwhich is the source and original of all. For although he loves the gifts\nwhich he daily confers, as emanations from that fountain, yet it is our\nduty to adhere to that gratuitous acceptance, which alone can support\nour souls, and to connect the gifts of his Spirit, which he afterwards\nbestows on us, with the first cause, in such a manner as will not be\nderogatory to it.\nFootnote 1:\nJer. xvii. 9.\nFootnote 2:\nGen. vi. 5; viii. 21.\nFootnote 3:\nPsalm xciv. 11; xxxvi. 1.\nFootnote 4:\nPsalm xiv. 1-3.

          "content": "BOASTING OF THE MERIT OF WORKS, EQUALLY SUBVERSIVE OF GOD’S GLORY IN THE\nGIFT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND OF THE CERTAINTY OF SALVATION.\nWe have now discussed the principal branch of this subject; that because\nrighteousness, if dependent on works, must inevitably be confounded in\nthe sight of God, therefore it is contained exclusively in the mercy of\nGod and the participation of Christ, and consequently in faith alone.\nNow, it must be carefully remarked that this is the principal hinge on\nwhich the argument turns, that we may not be implicated in the common\ndelusion, which equally affects the learned and the vulgar. For as soon\nas justification by faith or works becomes the subject of inquiry, they\nhave immediate recourse to those passages which seem to attribute to\nworks some degree of merit in the sight of God; as though justification\nby works would be fully evinced, if they could be proved to be of any\nvalue before God. We have already clearly demonstrated that the\nrighteousness of works consists only in a perfect and complete\nobservance of the law. Whence it follows, that no man is justified by\nworks, but he who, being elevated to the summit of perfection, cannot be\nconvicted even of the least transgression. This, therefore, is a\ndifferent and separate question, whether, although works be utterly\ninsufficient for the justification of men, they do not, nevertheless,\nmerit the grace of God.\nII. In the first place, with respect to the term _merit_, it is\nnecessary for me to premise, that whoever first applied it to human\nworks, as compared with the Divine judgment, showed very little concern\nfor the purity of the faith. I gladly abstain from all controversies\nabout mere words; but I could wish that this sobriety had always been\nobserved by Christian writers, that they had avoided the unnecessary\nadoption of terms not used in the Scriptures, and calculated to produce\ngreat offence, but very little advantage. For what necessity was there\nfor the introduction of the word _merit_, when the value of good works\nmight be significantly expressed without offence by a different term?\nBut the great offence contained in it, appears in the great injury the\nworld has received from it. The consummate haughtiness of its import can\nonly obscure the Divine grace, and taint the minds of men with\npresumptuous arrogance. I confess, the ancient writers of the Church\nhave generally used it, and I wish that their misuse of one word had not\nbeen the occasion of error to posterity. Yet they also declare in some\nplaces that they did not intend any thing prejudicial to the truth. For\nthis is the language of Augustine in one passage: “Let human merit,\nwhich was lost by Adam, here be silent, and let the grace of God reign\nthrough Jesus Christ.” Again: “The saints ascribe nothing to their own\nmerits; they will ascribe all, O God, only to thy mercy.” In another\nplace: “And when a man sees that whatever good he has, he has it not\nfrom himself, but from his God, he sees that all that is commended in\nhim proceeds not from his own merits, but from the Divine mercy.” We see\nhow, by divesting man of the power of performing good actions, he\nlikewise destroys the dignity of merit. Chrysostom says, “Our works, if\nthere be any consequent on God’s gratuitous vocation, are a retribution\nand a debt; but the gifts of God are grace, beneficence, and immense\nliberality.” Leaving the name, however, let us rather attend to the\nthing. I have before cited a passage from Bernard: “As not to presume on\nour merits is sufficiently meritorious, so to be destitute of merits is\nsufficient for the judgment.” But by the explanation immediately\nannexed, he properly softens the harshness of these expressions, when he\nsays, “Therefore you should be concerned to have merits; and if you have\nthem, you should know that they are given to you; you should hope for\nthe fruit, the mercy of God; and you have escaped all danger of poverty,\ningratitude, and presumption. Happy the Church which is not destitute,\neither of merits without presumption, or of presumption without merits.”\nAnd just before he had fully shown how pious his meaning was. “For\nconcerning merits,” he says, “why should the Church be solicitous, which\nhas a more firm and secure foundation for glorying in the purpose of\nGod? For God cannot deny himself; he will perform what he has promised.\nThus you have no reason for inquiring, on account of what merits we may\nhope for blessings, especially when you read, ‘Not for your sakes, but\nfor my sake;’[63] it is sufficiently meritorious to know that merits are\ninsufficient.”\nIII. The Scripture shows what all our works are capable of meriting,\nwhen it represents them as unable to bear the Divine scrutiny, because\nthey are full of impurity; and in the next place, what would be merited\nby the perfect observance of the law, if this could any where be found,\nwhen it directs us, “When ye shall have done all those things which are\ncommanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants;”[64] because we shall\nnot have conferred any favour on God, but only have performed the duties\nincumbent on us, for which no thanks are due. Nevertheless, the good\nworks which the Lord has conferred on us, he denominates our own, and\ndeclares that he will not only accept, but also reward them. It is our\nduty to be animated by so great a promise, and to stir up our minds that\nwe “be not weary in well doing,”[65] and to be truly grateful for so\ngreat an instance of Divine goodness. It is beyond a doubt, that\nwhatever is laudable in our works proceeds from the grace of God; and\nthat we cannot properly ascribe the least portion of it to ourselves. If\nwe truly and seriously acknowledge this truth, not only all confidence,\nbut likewise all idea of merit, immediately vanishes. We, I say, do not,\nlike the sophists, divide the praise of good works between God and man,\nbut we preserve it to the Lord complete, entire, and uncontaminated. All\nthat we attribute to man, is, that those works which were otherwise good\nare tainted and polluted by his impurity. For nothing proceeds from the\nmost perfect man, which is wholly immaculate. Therefore let the Lord sit\nin judgment on the best of human actions, and he will indeed recognize\nin them his own righteousness, but man’s disgrace and shame. Good works,\ntherefore, are pleasing to God, and not unprofitable to the authors of\nthem; and they will moreover receive the most ample blessings from God\nas their reward; not because they merit them, but because the Divine\ngoodness has freely appointed them this reward. But what wickedness is\nit, not to be content with that Divine liberality which remunerates\nworks destitute of merit with unmerited rewards, but with sacrilegious\nambition still to aim at more, that what entirely originates in the\nDivine munificence may appear to be a compensation of the merit of\nworks! Here I appeal to the common sense of every man. If he who, by the\nliberality of another, enjoys the use and profit of an estate, usurp to\nhimself also the title of proprietor, does he not by such ingratitude\ndeserve to lose the possession which he had? So also if a slave,\nmanumitted by his master, conceal his mean condition as a freed-man, and\nboast that he was free by birth, does he not deserve to be reduced to\nhis former servitude? For this is the legitimate way of enjoying a\nbenefit, if we neither arrogate more than is given us, nor defraud our\nbenefactor of his due praise; but, on the contrary, conduct ourselves in\nsuch a manner, that what he has conferred on us may appear, as it were,\nto continue with himself. If this moderation ought to be observed\ntowards men, let every one examine and consider what is due to God.\nIV. I know that the sophists abuse some texts in order to prove that the\nterm _merit_ is found in the Scriptures with reference to God. They cite\na passage from Ecclesiasticus: “Mercy shall make place for every man\naccording to the merit of his works.”[66] And from the Epistle to the\nHebrews: “To do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with such\nsacrifices men merit of God.”[67] My right to reject the authority of\nEcclesiasticus I at present relinquish; but I deny that they faithfully\ncite the words of the writer of Ecclesiasticus, whoever he might be; for\nin the Greek copy it is as follows: Παση ελεημοσυνη ποιησει τοπον·\nἑκαστος γαρ κατα τα εργα αυτου εὑρησει. “He shall make place for every\nmercy; and every man shall find according to his works.” And that this\nis the genuine reading, which is corrupted in the Latin version, appears\nboth from the complexion of the words themselves and from the preceding\ncontext. In the passage quoted from the Epistle to the Hebrews, there is\nno reason why they should endeavour to insnare us by a single word, when\nthe apostle’s words in the Greek imply nothing more than that “with such\nsacrifices God is well pleased.” This alone ought to be abundantly\nsufficient to repress and subdue the insolence of our pride, that we\ntransgress not the scriptural rule by ascribing any dignity to human\nworks. Moreover, the doctrine of the Scripture is, that our good works\nare perpetually defiled with many blemishes, which might justly offend\nGod and incense him against us; so far are they from being able to\nconciliate his favour, or to excite his beneficence towards us; yet\nthat, because in his great mercy he does not examine them according to\nthe rigour of his justice, he accepts them as though they were\nimmaculately pure, and therefore rewards them, though void of all merit,\nwith infinite blessings both in this life and in that which is to come.\nFor I cannot admit the distinction laid down by some, who are otherwise\nmen of learning and piety, that good works merit the graces which are\nconferred on us in this life, and that eternal salvation is the reward\nof faith alone; because the Lord almost always places the reward of\nlabours and the crown of victory in heaven. Besides, to ascribe the\naccumulation of graces upon graces, given us by the Lord, to the merit\nof works, in such a manner as to detract it from grace, is contrary to\nthe doctrine of the Scripture. For though Christ says, that “to every\none that hath shall be given,” and that “the good and faithful servant,\nwho hath been faithful over a few things, shall be made ruler over many\nthings,”[68] yet he likewise shows in another place, that the\nimprovements of believers are the gifts of his gratuitous kindness. “Ho,\nevery one that thirsteth,” says he, “come ye to the waters, and he that\nhath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk\nwithout money and without price.”[69] Whatever, therefore, is now\nconferred on believers to promote their salvation as well as their\nfuture blessedness, flows exclusively from the beneficence of God;\nnevertheless he declares, that both in the latter and in the former, he\nhas respect to our works, because, to demonstrate the magnitude of his\nlove to us, he dignifies with such honour, not only ourselves, but even\nthe gifts which he has bestowed on us.\nV. If these points had been handled and digested in proper order in\nformer ages, there would never have arisen so many debates and\ndissensions. Paul says, that in erecting the superstructure of Christian\ndoctrine, it is necessary to retain that foundation which he had laid\namong the Corinthians, other than which no man can lay, which is Jesus\nChrist.[70] What kind of a foundation have we in Christ? Has he begun\nour salvation, that we may complete it ourselves? and has he merely\nopened a way for us to proceed in by our own powers? By no means; but,\nas the apostle before stated, when we acknowledge him, he is “made unto\nus righteousness.”[71] No man, therefore, is properly founded on Christ,\nbut he who has complete righteousness in him; since the apostle says,\nthat he was sent, not to assist us in the attainment of righteousness,\nbut to be himself our righteousness; that is to say, that we were chosen\nin him from eternity, before the formation of the world, not on account\nof any merit of ours, but according to the purpose of the Divine\nwill;[72] that by the death of Christ we are redeemed from the sentence\nof death, and liberated from perdition;[73] that in him we are adopted\nas sons and heirs by the heavenly Father,[74] to whom we have been\nreconciled by his blood; that being committed to his protection, we are\nnot in the least danger of perishing;[75] that being thus ingrafted into\nhim, we are already, as it were, partakers of eternal life, and entered\nby hope into the kingdom of God; and moreover, that having obtained such\na participation of him, however foolish we may be in ourselves, he is\nour wisdom before God; that however impure we are, he is our purity;\nthat though we are weak and exposed to Satan, yet that power is ours\nwhich is given to him in heaven and in earth,[76] by which he defeats\nSatan for us, and breaks the gates of hell; that though we still carry\nabout with us a body of death, yet he is our life; in short, that all\nthat is his belongs to us, and that we have every thing in him, but\nnothing in ourselves. On this foundation, I say, it is necessary for us\nto build, if we wish to “grow unto a holy temple in the Lord.”[77]\nVI. But the world has long been taught a different lesson; for I know\nnot what good works of morality have been invented to render men\nacceptable to God, before they are ingrafted into Christ. As though the\nScripture were false in asserting, that “he that hath not the Son of\nGod, hath not life.”[78] If they are destitute of life, how could they\ngenerate any cause of life? As though there were no truth in the\ndeclaration, that “whatsoever is not of faith, is sin!”[79] as though an\nevil tree could produce good fruits! But what room have these most\npestilent sophists left to Christ for the exertion of his power? They\nsay that he has merited for us the first grace; that is, the opportunity\nof meriting; and that now it is our part not to miss the offered\nopportunity. What extreme impudence and impiety! Who would have expected\nthat any persons professing the name of Christ, would presume thus to\nrob him of his power, and almost to trample him under their feet? It is\nevery where testified of him, that all who believe in him are\njustified:[80] these men tell us, that the only benefit received from\nhim is, that a way is opened for all men to justify themselves. But I\nwish that they had experienced what is contained in these passages: “He\nthat hath the Son, hath life;”[81] “he that believeth is passed from\ndeath unto life;”[82] “justified by his grace,” that we might “be made\nheirs of eternal life;”[83] that believers have Christ abiding in them,\nby whom they are united to God;[84] that they are partakers of his life,\nand sit with him “in heavenly places;”[85] that they are translated into\nthe kingdom of God, and have obtained salvation;[86] and innumerable\nplaces of similar import. For they do not signify that by faith in\nChrist we merely gain the ability to attain righteousness or effect our\nsalvation, but that both are bestowed on us. Therefore, as soon as we\nare ingrafted into Christ by faith, we are already become sons of God,\nheirs of heaven, partakers of righteousness, possessors of life, and\n(the better to refute their falsehoods) we have attained, not the\nopportunity of meriting, but all the merits of Christ; for they are all\ncommunicated to us.\nVII. Thus the Sorbonic schools, those sources of all kinds of errors,\nhave deprived us of justification by faith, which is the substance of\nall piety. They grant, indeed, in words, that a man is justified by\nfaith formed; but this they afterwards explain to be, because faith\nrenders good works effectual to justification; so that their mention of\nfaith has almost the appearance of mockery, since it could not be passed\nover in silence, while the Scripture is so full of it, without exposing\nthem to great censure. And not content with this, they rob God of part\nof the praise of good works, and transfer it to man. Perceiving that\ngood works avail but little to the exaltation of man, and that they\ncannot properly be denominated merits if they be considered as the\neffects of Divine grace, they derive them from the power of free-will;\nwhich is like extracting oil from a stone. They contend, that though\ngrace be the principal cause of them, yet that this is not to the\nexclusion of free-will, from which all merit originates. And this is\nmaintained not only by the latter sophists, but likewise by their\nmaster, Lombard, whom, when compared with them, we may pronounce to be\nsound and sober. Truly wonderful was their blindness, with Augustine so\nfrequently in their mouths, not to see how solicitously he endeavoured\nto prevent men from arrogating the least degree of glory on account of\ngood works. Before, when we discussed the question of free-will, we\ncited from him some testimonies to this purpose; and similar ones\nfrequently recur in his writings; as when he forbids us ever to boast of\nour merits, since even they are the gifts of God; and when he says,\n“that all our merit proceeds from grace alone; that it is not obtained\nby our sufficiency, but is produced entirely by grace,” &c. That Lombard\nwas blind to the light of Scripture, in which he appears not to have\nbeen so well versed, need not excite so much surprise. Yet nothing could\nbe wished for more explicit, in opposition to him and his disciples,\nthan this passage of the apostle; who, having interdicted Christians\nfrom all boasting, subjoins as a reason why boasting is unlawful, that\n“we are his (God’s) workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good\nworks, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.”[87]\nSince nothing good, then, can proceed from us but as we are regenerated,\nand our regeneration is, without exception, entirely of God, we have no\nright to arrogate to ourselves the smallest particle of our good works.\nLastly, while they assiduously inculcate good works, they at the same\ntime instruct the consciences of men in such a manner, that they can\nnever dare to be confident that God is propitious and favourable to\ntheir works. But, on the contrary, our doctrine, without any mention of\nmerit, animates the minds of believers with peculiar consolation, while\nwe teach them that their works are pleasing to God, and that their\npersons are undoubtedly accepted by him. And we likewise require, that\nno man attempt or undertake any work without faith; that is, unless he\ncan previously determine, with a certain confidence of mind, that it\nwill be pleasing to God.\nVIII. Wherefore let us not suffer ourselves to be seduced even a hair’s\nbreadth from the only foundation, on which, when it is laid, wise\narchitects erect a firm and regular superstructure. For if there be a\nnecessity for doctrine and exhortation, they apprize us, that “for this\npurpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works\nof the devil; whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin:”[88] “the\ntime past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the\nGentiles;”[89] the elect of God are vessels of mercy selected to honour,\nand therefore ought to be cleansed from all impurity.[90] But every\nthing is said at once, when it is shown that Christ chooses such for his\ndisciples as will deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow\nhim.[91] He who has denied himself, has laid the axe to the root of all\nevils, that he may no longer seek those things which are his own; he who\nhas taken up his cross, has prepared himself for all patience and\ngentleness. But the example of Christ comprehends not only these, but\nall other duties of piety and holiness. He was obedient to his Father,\neven to death; he was entirely occupied in performing the works of God;\nhe aspired with his whole soul to promote the glory of his Father; he\nlaid down his life for his brethren; he both acted and prayed for the\nbenefit of his enemies. But if there be need of consolation, these\npassages will afford it in a wonderful degree: “We are troubled on every\nside, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;\npersecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always\nbearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life\nalso of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.”[92] “If we be dead\nwith him, we shall also live with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign\nwith him.”[93] “Being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I\nmight attain unto the resurrection of the dead.”[94] The Father has\npredestinated all whom he has chosen in his Son “to be conformed to his\nimage, that he might be the first-born among many brethren;” and\ntherefore “neither death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to\ncome, shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ\nJesus;”[95] but “all things shall work together for good”[96] to us, and\nconduce to our salvation. We do not justify men by works before God; but\nwe say, that all who are of God are regenerated and made new creatures,\nthat they may depart from the kingdom of sin into the kingdom of\nrighteousness; and that by this testimony they ascertain their\nvocation,[97] and, like trees, are judged by their fruits.\nFootnote 63:\nEzek. xxxvi. 32.\nFootnote 64:\nLuke xvii. 10.\nFootnote 65:\nGal. vi. 9. 2 Thess. iii. 13.\nFootnote 66:\nEcclus. xvi. 14.\nFootnote 67:\nHeb. xiii. 16.\nFootnote 68:\nMatt. xxv. 21, 29.\nFootnote 69:\nIsaiah lv. 1.\nFootnote 70:\n1 Cor. iii. 10, 11.\nFootnote 71:\n1 Cor. i. 30.\nFootnote 72:\nEphes. i. 3-5.\nFootnote 73:\nCol. i. 14, 20, 21.\nFootnote 74:\nJohn i. 12.\nFootnote 75:\nJohn x. 28, 29.\nFootnote 76:\nMatt. xxviii. 18.\nFootnote 77:\nEphes. ii 21.

          "content": "A REFUTATION OF THE INJURIOUS CALUMNIES OF THE PAPISTS AGAINST THIS\nDOCTRINE.\nThe observation with which we closed the preceding chapter is, of\nitself, sufficient to refute the impudence of some impious persons, who\naccuse us, in the first place, of destroying good works, and seducing\nmen from the pursuit of them, when we say that they are not justified by\nworks, nor saved through their own merit; and secondly, of making too\neasy a road to righteousness, when we teach that it consists in the\ngratuitous remission of sins; and of enticing men, by this allurement,\nto the practice of sin, to which they have naturally too strong a\npropensity. These calumnies, I say, are sufficiently refuted by that one\nobservation; yet I will briefly reply to them both. They allege that\njustification by faith destroys good works. I forbear any remarks on the\ncharacters of these zealots for good works, who thus calumniate us. Let\nthem rail with impunity as licentiously as they infest the whole world\nwith the impurity of their lives. They affect to lament that while faith\nis so magnificently extolled, works are degraded from their proper rank.\nWhat if they be more encouraged and established? For we never dream\neither of a faith destitute of good works, or of a justification\nunattended by them: this is the sole difference, that while we\nacknowledge a necessary connection between faith and good works, we\nattribute justification, not to works, but to faith. Our reason for this\nwe can readily explain, if we only turn to Christ, towards whom faith is\ndirected, and from whom it receives all its virtue. Why, then, are we\njustified by faith? Because by faith we apprehend the righteousness of\nChrist, which is the only medium of our reconciliation to God. But this\nyou cannot attain, without at the same time attaining to sanctification;\nfor he “is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and\nredemption.”[98] Christ therefore justifies no one whom he does not also\nsanctify. For these benefits are perpetually and indissolubly connected,\nso that whom he illuminates with his wisdom, them he redeems; whom he\nredeems, he justifies; whom he justifies, he sanctifies. But as the\npresent question relates only to righteousness and sanctification, let\nus insist upon them. We may distinguish between them, but Christ\ncontains both inseparably in himself. Do you wish, then, to obtain\nrighteousness in Christ? You must first possess Christ; but you cannot\npossess him without becoming a partaker of his sanctification; for he\ncannot be divided. Since, then, the Lord affords us the enjoyment of\nthese blessings only in the bestowment of himself, he gives them both\ntogether, and never one without the other. Thus we see how true it is\nthat we are justified, not without works, yet not by works; since union\nwith Christ, by which we are justified, contains sanctification as well\nas righteousness.\nII. It is also exceedingly false, that the minds of men are seduced from\nan inclination to virtue, by our divesting them of all ideas of merit.\nHere the reader must just be informed, that they impertinently argue\nfrom reward to merit, as I shall afterwards more fully explain; because,\nin fact, they are ignorant of this principle, that God is equally\nliberal in assigning a reward to good works, as in imparting an ability\nto perform them. But this I would rather defer to its proper place. It\nwill suffice, at present, to show the weakness of their objection, which\nshall be done two ways. For, first, when they say that there will be no\nconcern about the proper regulation of our life without a hope of reward\nbeing proposed, they altogether deceive themselves. If they only mean\nthat men serve God in expectation of a reward, and hire or sell their\nservices to him, they gain but little; for he will be freely worshipped\nand freely loved, and he approves of that worshipper who, after being\ndeprived of all hope of receiving any reward, still ceases not to\nworship him. Besides, if men require to be stimulated, it is impossible\nto urge more forcible arguments than those which arise from the end of\nour redemption and calling; such as the word of God adduces, when it\ninculcates, that it is the greatest and most impious ingratitude not\nreciprocally to “love him who first loved us;”[99] that “by the blood of\nChrist our consciences are purged from dead works, to serve the living\nGod;”[100] that it is a horrible sacrilege, after having been once\npurged, to defile ourselves with new pollutions, and to profane that\nsacred blood;[101] that we have been “delivered out of the hand of our\nenemies,” that we “might serve him without fear, in holiness and\nrighteousness before him, all the days of our life;”[102] that we are\nmade “free from sin,” that with a free spirit we might “become the\nservants of righteousness;”[103] “that our old man is crucified,” that\n“we should walk in newness of life.”[104] Again: “If ye be risen with\nChrist,” as his members indeed are, “seek those things which are above,”\nand conduct yourselves as “pilgrims on the earth;” that you may aspire\ntowards heaven, where your treasure is.[105] That “the grace of God hath\nappeared, teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we\nshould live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;\nlooking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great\nGod and our Saviour.”[106] Wherefore “God hath not appointed us to\nwrath, but to obtain salvation by Christ.”[107] That we are the “temples\nof the Holy Ghost,” which it is unlawful to profane;[108] that we are\nnot _darkness_, “but light in the Lord,” whom it becomes to “walk as\nchildren of the light;”[109] that “God hath not called us unto\nuncleanness, but unto holiness; for this is the will of God, even our\nsanctification, that we should abstain from fornication;”[110] that our\ncalling is a holy one, which should be followed by a correspondent\npurity of life;[111] that we are “made free from sin,” that we might\n“become servants of righteousness.”[112] Can we be incited to charity by\nany stronger argument than that of John, “If God so loved us, we ought\nalso to love one another?” “in this the children of God are manifest,\nand the children of the devil;”[113] hereby the children of light, by\ntheir abiding in love, are distinguished from the children of darkness;\nor that of Paul, That if we be united to Christ, we are members of one\nbody, and ought to afford each other mutual assistance?[114] Or can we\nbe more powerfully excited to holiness, than when we are informed by\nJohn, that “every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even\nas God is pure?”[115] Or when Paul says, “Having therefore these\npromises, (relative to our adoption,) let us cleanse ourselves from all\nfilthiness of the flesh and spirit?”[116] or than when we hear Christ\nproposing himself as our example, that we should follow his steps?[117]\nIII. These few instances, indeed, I have given as a specimen; for if I\nwere disposed to quote every particular passage, I should produce a\nlarge volume. The apostles are quite full of admonitions, exhortations,\nand reproofs, to “furnish the man of God unto all good works,”[118] and\nthat without any mention of merit. But they rather deduce their\nprincipal exhortations from this consideration, That our salvation\ndepends not on any merit of ours, but merely on the mercy of God. As\nPaul, after having very largely shown that we can have no hope of life,\nbut from the righteousness of Christ, when he proceeds to exhortations,\nbeseeches us “by the mercies of God” with which we have been\nfavoured.[119] And indeed this one reason ought to be enough; that God\nmay be glorified in us.[120] But if any persons be not so powerfully\naffected by the glory of God, yet the remembrance of his benefits should\nbe amply sufficient to incite them to rectitude of conduct. But these\nmen, who by the obtrusion of merit extort some servile and constrained\nacts of obedience to the law, are guilty of falsehood when they affirm\nthat we have no arguments to enforce the practice of good works, because\nwe do not proceed in the same way; as though, truly, such obedience were\nvery pleasing to God, who declares that he “loveth a cheerful giver;”\nand forbids any thing to be given “grudgingly, or of necessity.”[121]\nNor do I say this, because I either reject or neglect that kind of\nexhortation, which the Scripture frequently uses, that no method of\nanimating us to our duty may be omitted. It mentions the reward which\n“God will render to every man according to his works;”[122] but that\nthis is the only argument, or the principal one, I deny. In the next\nplace, I assert that we ought not to begin with it. Moreover, I contend\nthat it has no tendency to establish the merit preached by these men, as\nwe shall afterwards see; and, lastly, that it is entirely useless,\nunless preceded by this doctrine, That we are justified solely on\naccount of the merit of Christ, apprehended by faith, and not on account\nof any merit in our own works; because none can be capable of the\npursuit of holiness, but such as have previously imbibed this doctrine.\nThis sentiment is beautifully suggested by the Psalmist when he thus\naddresses the Lord: “There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be\nfeared;”[123] for he shows that there is no worship of God without an\nacknowledgment of his mercy, on which alone it is both founded and\nestablished. And this well deserves to be remarked, in order that we may\nknow, not only that the true worship of God arises from a reliance on\nhis mercy, but that the fear of God (which the Papists hold to be\nmeritorious) cannot be dignified with the title of _merit_, because it\nis founded in the pardon and remission of sins.\nIV. But the most futile of all their calumnies is, that men are\nencouraged to the practice of sin by our maintaining the gratuitous\nremission of sins, in which we make righteousness to consist. For we say\nthat so great a blessing could never be compensated by any virtue of\nours, and that therefore it could never be obtained, unless it were\ngratuitously bestowed; moreover, that it is gratuitous to us indeed, but\nnot so to Christ, whom it cost so much, even his own most sacred blood,\nbeside which no price sufficiently valuable could be paid to Divine\njustice. When men are taught in this manner, they are apprized that it\nis not owing to them that this most sacred blood is not shed as often as\nthey sin. Besides, we learn that such is our pollution, that it can\nnever be washed away, except in the fountain of this immaculate blood.\nMust not persons who hear these things conceive a greater horror of sin,\nthan if it were said to be cleansed by a sprinkling of good works? And\nif they have any fear of God, will they not dread, after being once\npurified, to plunge themselves again into the mire, and thereby to\ndisturb and infect, as far as they can, the purity of this fountain? “I\nhave washed my feet,” (says the believing soul in Solomon,) “how shall I\ndefile them?”[124] Now, it is plain which party better deserves the\ncharge of degrading the value of remission of sins, and prostituting the\ndignity of righteousness. They pretend that God is appeased by their\nfrivolous _satisfactions_, which are no better than dung; we assert,\nthat the guilt of sin is too atrocious to be expiated by such\ninsignificant trifles; that the displeasure of God is too great to be\nappeased by these worthless satisfactions; and therefore that this is\nthe exclusive prerogative of the blood of Christ. They say, that\nrighteousness, if it ever be defective, is restored and repaired by\nworks of satisfaction. We think it so valuable that no compensation of\nworks can be adequate to it; and therefore that for its restitution we\nmust have recourse to the mercy of God alone. The remaining particulars\nthat pertain to the remission of sins may be found in the next chapter.\nFootnote 98:\n1 Cor. i. 30.\nFootnote 99:\n1 John iv. 10, 19.\nFootnote 100:\nHeb. ix. 14.\nFootnote 101:\nHeb. x. 29.\nFootnote 102:\nLuke i. 74, 75.\nFootnote 103:\nRom. vi. 18.\nFootnote 104:\nRom. vi. 4, 6.\nFootnote 105:\nCol. iii. 1.

          "content": "THE HARMONY BETWEEN THE PROMISES OF THE LAW AND THOSE OF THE GOSPEL.\nLet us now pursue the other arguments with which Satan by his satellites\nattempts to destroy or to weaken justification by faith. I think we have\nalready gained this point with these calumniators—that they can no\nlonger accuse us of being enemies to good works. For we reject the\nnotion of justification by works, not that no good works may be done, or\nthat those which are performed may be denied to be good, but that we may\nneither confide in them, nor glory in them, nor ascribe salvation to\nthem. For this is our trust, this is our glory, and the only anchor of\nour salvation, That Christ the Son of God is ours, and that we are\nlikewise, in him, sons of God and heirs of the celestial kingdom; being\ncalled, not for our worthiness, but by the Divine goodness, to the hope\nof eternal felicity. But since they assail us besides, as we have\nobserved, with other weapons, let us also proceed to the repulsion of\nthem. In the first place, they return to the legal promises which the\nLord gave to the observers of his law, and inquire whether we suppose\nthem to be entirely vain, or of any validity. As it would be harsh and\nridiculous to say they are vain, they take it for granted that they have\nsome efficacy. Hence they argue, that we are not justified by faith\nalone. For thus saith the Lord, “Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye\nhearken to these judgments, and keep and do them, that the Lord thy God\nshall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy\nfathers; and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee.”[125]\nAgain: “If ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye\nthoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; if ye\noppress not, neither walk after other gods; then will I cause you to\ndwell in this place,” &c.[126] I am not willing to recite a thousand\npassages of the same kind, which, not being different in sense, will be\nelucidated by an explanation of these. The sum of all is declared by\nMoses, who says that in the law are proposed “a blessing and a curse,\nlife and death.”[127] Now, they argue, either that this blessing becomes\ninefficacious and nugatory, or that justification is not by faith alone.\nWe have already shown, how, if we adhere to the law, being destitute of\nevery blessing, we are obnoxious to the curse which is denounced on all\ntransgressors. For the Lord promises nothing, except to the perfect\nobservers of his law, of which description not one can be found. The\nconsequence then is, that all mankind are proved by the law to be\nobnoxious to the curse and wrath of God; in order to be saved from\nwhich, they need deliverance from the power of the law, and emancipation\nfrom its servitude; not a carnal liberty, which would seduce us from\nobedience to the law, invite to all kinds of licentiousness, break down\nthe barriers of inordinate desire, and give the reins to every lawless\npassion; but a spiritual liberty, which will console and elevate a\ndistressed and dejected conscience, showing it to be delivered from the\ncurse and condemnation under which it was held by the law. This\nliberation from subjection to the law, and manumission, (if I may use\nthe term,) we attain, when we apprehend by faith the mercy of God in\nChrist, by which we are assured of the remission of sins, by the sense\nof which the law penetrated us with compunction and remorse.\nII. For this reason all the promises of the law would be ineffectual and\nvain, unless we were assisted by the goodness of God in the gospel. For\nthe condition of a perfect obedience to the law, on which they depend,\nand in consequence of which alone they are to be fulfilled, will never\nbe performed. Now, the Lord affords this assistance, not by leaving a\npart of righteousness in our works, and supplying part from his mercy,\nbut by appointing Christ alone for the completion of righteousness. For\nthe apostle, having said that he and other Jews, “knowing that a man is\nnot justified by the works of the law, believed in Christ,” adds as a\nreason, not that they might be assisted to obtain a complete\nrighteousness by faith in Christ, but “that they might be justified by\nthe faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law.”[128] If the\nfaithful pass from the law to faith, to find righteousness in the\nlatter, which they perceive to be wanting in the former, they certainly\nrenounce the righteousness of the law. Therefore let whosoever will now\namplify the rewards which are said to await the observer of the law;\nonly let him remark, that our depravity prevents us from receiving any\nbenefit from them, till we have obtained by faith another righteousness.\nThus David, after having mentioned the reward which the Lord has\nprepared for his servants, immediately proceeds to the acknowledgment of\nsins, by which it is annulled. In the nineteenth psalm, likewise, he\nmagnificently celebrates the benefits of the law; but immediately\nexclaims, “Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret\nfaults.”[129] This passage perfectly accords with that before referred\nto, where, after having said, “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and\ntruth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies,” he adds, “For\nthy name’s sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.”[130] So\nwe ought also to acknowledge, that the Divine favour is offered to us in\nthe law, if we could purchase it by our works; but that no merit of ours\ncan ever obtain it.\nIII. What, then, it will be said, were those promises given, to vanish\naway without producing any effect? I have already declared that this is\nnot my opinion. I assert, indeed, that they have no efficacy with\nrespect to us as long as they are referred to the merit of works;\nwherefore, considered in themselves, they are in some sense abolished.\nThus that grand promise, “Keep my statutes and judgments; which if a man\ndo, he shall live in them;”[131] the apostle maintains to be of no value\nto us, if we rest upon it, and that it will be no more beneficial to us\nthan if it had never been given; because it is inapplicable to the\nholiest of God’s servants, who are all far from fulfilling the law, and\nare encompassed with a multitude of transgressions.[132] But when these\nare superseded by the evangelical promises, which proclaim the\ngratuitous remission of sins, the consequence is, that not only our\npersons, but also our works, are accepted by God; and not accepted only,\nbut followed by those blessings, which were due by the covenant to the\nobservance of the law. I grant, therefore, that the works of believers\nare rewarded by those things which the Lord has promised in his law to\nthe followers of righteousness and holiness; but in this retribution it\nis always necessary to consider the cause, which conciliates such favour\nto those works. Now, this we perceive to be threefold: The first is,\nThat God, averting his eyes from the actions of his servants, which are\ninvariably more deserving of censure than of praise, receives and\nembraces them in Christ, and by the intervention of faith alone\nreconciles them to himself without the assistance of works. The second\nis, That in his paternal benignity and indulgence, he overlooks the\nintrinsic worth of these works, and exalts them to such honour, that he\nesteems them of some degree of value. The third cause is, That he\npardons these works as he receives them, not imputing the imperfection\nwith which they are all so defiled, that they might otherwise be\naccounted rather sins than virtues. Hence it appears how great has been\nthe delusion of the sophists, who thought that they had dexterously\navoided all absurdities by saying that works are sufficient to merit\nsalvation, not on account of their own intrinsic goodness, but by reason\nof the covenant, because the Lord in his mercy has estimated them so\nhighly. But at the same time, they had not observed how far the works,\nwhich they styled _meritorious_, fell short of the condition of the\npromise; unless they were preceded by justification founded on faith\nalone, and by remission of sins, by which even good works require to be\npurified from blemishes. Therefore, of the three causes of the Divine\ngoodness, in consequence of which the works of believers are accepted,\nthey only noticed one, and suppressed two others, and those the\nprincipal.\nIV. They allege the declaration of Peter, which Luke recites in the\nActs: “Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in\nevery nation he that worketh righteousness is accepted with him.”[133]\nAnd hence they conclude, what they think admits of no doubt, that if a\nman by rectitude of conduct conciliate to himself the favour of God, the\ngrace of God is not the sole cause of his salvation; moreover, that God\nof his own mercy assists a sinner in such a manner, as to be influenced\nto the exercise of mercy by his works. But we cannot by any means\nreconcile the Scriptures with themselves, unless we observe a twofold\nacceptance of man with God. For God finds nothing in man, in his native\ncondition, to incline him to mercy, but mere misery. If, then, it is\nevident that man is entirely destitute of all good, and full of every\nkind of evil, when he is first received by God, by what good qualities\nshall we pronounce him entitled to the heavenly calling? Let us reject,\ntherefore, all vain imagination of merits, where God so evidently\ndisplays his unmerited clemency. The declaration of the angel to\nCornelius in the same passage, “Thy prayers and thine alms are come up\nfor a memorial before God,” they most wickedly pervert to prove that the\npractice of good works prepares a man to receive the grace of God. For\nCornelius must have been already illuminated with the Spirit of wisdom,\nsince he was endued with the fear of God, which is true wisdom; and he\nmust have been sanctified by the same Spirit, since he was a follower of\nrighteousness, which the apostle represents as one of the Spirit’s most\ncertain fruits.[134] It was from the grace of God, then, that he derived\nall these things in which he is said to have pleased him; so far was he\nfrom preparing himself to receive it by the exercise of his own powers.\nThere cannot indeed be adduced a single syllable of the Scripture, which\nis not in harmony with this doctrine; That there is no other cause for\nGod’s reception of man into his love, than his knowledge that man, if\nabandoned by him, would be utterly lost; and because it is not his will\nto abandon him to perdition, he displays his mercy in his deliverance.\nNow, we see that this acceptance is irrespective of the righteousness of\nman, but is an unequivocal proof of the Divine goodness towards\nmiserable sinners, who are infinitely unworthy of so great a favour.\nV. After the Lord has recovered a man from the abyss of perdition, and\nseparated him to himself by the grace of adoption,—because he has\nregenerated him, and raised him to a new life, he now receives and\nembraces him, as a new creature, with the gifts of his Spirit. This is\nthe acceptance mentioned by Peter, in which even the works of believers\nafter their vocation are approved by God; for the Lord cannot but love\nand accept those good effects which are produced in them by his Spirit.\nBut it must always be remembered, that they are accepted by God in\nconsequence of their works, only because, for their sakes and the favour\nwhich he bears to them, he deigns to accept whatever goodness he has\nliberally communicated to their works. For whence proceeds the goodness\nof their works, but from the Lord’s determination to adorn with true\npurity those whom he has chosen as vessels of honour? And how is it that\nthey are accounted good, as though they were free from all imperfection,\nexcept from the mercy of their Father, who pardons the blemishes which\nadhere to them? In a word, Peter intends nothing else in this passage,\nbut that God accepts and loves his children, in whom he beholds the\nmarks and lineaments of his own countenance; for we have elsewhere shown\nthat regeneration is a reparation of the Divine image in us. Wherever\nthe Lord contemplates his own likeness, he justly both loves and honours\nit. The life of his children, therefore, being devoted to holiness and\nrighteousness, is truly represented as pleasing to him. But as the\nfaithful, while they are surrounded with mortal flesh, are still\nsinners, and all their works are imperfect, and tainted with the vices\nof the flesh, he cannot be propitious either to their persons or to\ntheir works, without regarding them in Christ rather than in themselves.\nIt is in this sense that those passages must be understood, which\ndeclare God to be merciful and compassionate to the followers of\nrighteousness. Moses said to the Israelites, “The Lord thy God, which\nkeepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his\ncommandments, to a thousand generations”[135]—a sentence which was\nafterwards in frequent use among that people. Thus Solomon, in his\nsolemn prayer: “Lord God of Israel, who keepest covenant and mercy with\nthy servants that walk before thee with all their heart.”[136] The same\nlanguage is also repeated by Nehemiah.[137] For as, in all the covenants\nof his mercy, the Lord stipulates with his servants for integrity and\nsanctity in their lives, that his goodness may not become an object of\ncontempt, and that no man infected with a vain confidence in his\nmercy,[138] may bless himself in his mind while walking in the depravity\nof his heart, so he designs by these means to confine to their duty all\nthat are admitted to the participation of his covenant; yet,\nnevertheless, the covenant is originally constituted and perpetually\nremains altogether gratuitous. For this reason, David, though he\ndeclares that he had been rewarded for the purity of his hands, does not\noverlook that original source which I have mentioned: “He delivered me,\nbecause he delighted in me;”[139] where he commends the goodness of his\ncause, so as not to derogate from the gratuitous mercy which precedes\nall the gifts that originate from it.\nVI. And here it will be useful to remark, by the way, what difference\nthere is between such forms of expression and the legal promises. By\nlegal promises I intend, not all those which are contained in the books\nof Moses,—since in those books there likewise occur many evangelical\nones,—but such as properly pertain to the ministry of the law. Such\npromises, by whatever appellation they may be distinguished, proclaim\nthat a reward is ready to be bestowed, on condition that we perform what\nis commanded. But when it is said that “the Lord keepeth covenant and\nmercy with them that love him,” this rather designates the characters of\nhis servants, who have faithfully received his covenant, than expresses\nthe causes of his beneficence to them. Now, this is the way to prove it:\nAs the Lord favours us with the hope of eternal life, in order that he\nmay be loved, reverenced, and worshipped by us, therefore all the\npromises of mercy contained in the Scriptures are justly directed to\nthis end, that we may revere and worship the Author of our blessings.\nWhenever, therefore, we hear of his beneficence to them who observe his\nlaws, let us remember that the children of God are designated by the\nduty in which they ought always to be found; and that we are adopted as\nhis children, in order that we may venerate him as our Father.\nTherefore, that we may not renounce the privilege of our adoption, we\nought to aim at that which is the design of our vocation. On the other\nhand, however, we may be assured, that the accomplishment of God’s mercy\nis independent of the works of believers; but that he fulfils the\npromise of salvation to them whose vocation is followed by a\ncorrespondent rectitude of life, because in them who are directed by his\nSpirit to good works, he recognizes the genuine characters of his\nchildren. To this must be referred what is said of the citizens of the\nChurch: “Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy\nholy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,”\n&c.[140] And in Isaiah: “Who shall dwell with the devouring fire? He\nthat walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly,” &c.[141] For these\npassages describe, not the foundation which supports the faithful before\nGod, but the manner in which their most merciful Father introduces them\ninto communion with him, and preserves and confirms them in it. For as\nhe detests sin, and loves righteousness, those whom he unites to him he\npurifies by his Spirit, in order to conform them to himself and his\nkingdom. Therefore, if it be inquired what is the first cause which\ngives the saints an entrance into the kingdom of God, and which makes\ntheir continuance in it permanent, the answer is ready; Because the Lord\nin his mercy has once adopted and perpetually defends them. But if the\nquestion relate to the manner in which he does this, it will then be\nnecessary to advert to regeneration and its fruits, which are enumerated\nin the psalm that we have just quoted.\nVII. But there appears to be much greater difficulty in those places\nwhich dignify good works with the title of _righteousness_, and assert\nthat a man is justified by them. Of the former kind there are many,\nwhere the observance of the commands is denominated _justification_ or\n_righteousness_. An example of the other kind we find in Moses: “And it\nshall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these\ncommandments.”[142] If it be objected that this is a legal promise,\nwhich, having an impossible condition annexed to it, proves\nnothing,—there are other passages which will not admit of a similar\nreply; such as, “In case thou shalt deliver him the pledge, &c., it\nshall be righteousness unto thee before the Lord.”[143] Similar to this\nis what the Psalmist says, that the zeal of Phinehas in avenging the\ndisgrace of Israel, “was counted unto him for righteousness.”[144]\nTherefore the Pharisees of our day suppose that these passages afford\nample ground for their clamour against us. For when we say, that if the\nrighteousness of faith be established, there is an end of justification\nby works,—they argue, in the same manner, that if righteousness be by\nworks, then it is not true that we are justified by faith alone. Though\nI grant that the precepts of the law are termed _righteousness_, there\nis nothing surprising in this; for they are so in reality. The reader,\nhowever, ought to be apprized that the Hebrew word חקים (_commandments_)\nis not well translated by the Greek word δικαιωματα, (_righteousness_.)\nBut I readily relinquish all controversy respecting the word. Nor do we\ndeny that the Divine law contains perfect righteousness. For although,\nbeing under an obligation to fulfil all its precepts, we should, even\nafter a perfect obedience to it, only be unprofitable servants,—yet,\nsince the Lord has honoured the observance of it with the title of\n_righteousness_, we would not detract from what he has given. We freely\nacknowledge, therefore, that the perfect obedience of the law is\nrighteousness, and that the observance of every particular command is a\npart of righteousness; since complete righteousness consists of all the\nparts. But we deny that such a kind of righteousness any where exists.\nAnd therefore we reject the righteousness of the law; not that it is of\nitself defective and mutilated, but because, on account of the debility\nof our flesh,[145] it is no where to be found. It may be said, that the\nScripture not only calls the Divine precepts _righteousnesses_, but\ngives this appellation also to the works of the saints. As where it\nrelates of Zacharias and his wife, that “they were both righteous before\nGod, walking in all his commandments:”[146] certainly, when it speaks\nthus, it estimates their works rather according to the nature of the\nlaw, than according to the actual condition of the persons. Here it is\nnecessary to repeat the observation which I have just made, that no rule\nis to be drawn from the incautiousness of the Greek translator. But as\nLuke has not thought proper to alter the common version, neither will I\ncontend for it. Those things which are commanded in the law, God has\nenjoined upon man as necessary to righteousness; but that righteousness\nwe do not fulfil without observing the whole law, which is broken by\nevery act of transgression. Since the law, therefore, only prescribes a\nrighteousness, if we contemplate the law itself, all its distinct\ncommands are parts of righteousness; if we consider men, by whom they\nare performed, they cannot obtain the praise of righteousness from one\nact, while they are transgressors in many, and while that same act is\npartly vicious by reason of its imperfection.\nVIII. But I proceed to the second class of texts, in which the principal\ndifficulty lies. Paul urges nothing more forcible in proof of\njustification by faith, than what is stated respecting Abraham—that he\n“believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.”[147]\nSince the action of Phinehas, therefore, is said to have been “counted\nunto him for righteousness,”[148] we may also use the same argument\nconcerning works, which Paul insists on respecting faith. Therefore our\nadversaries, as though they had established the point, determine that we\nare justified neither without faith, nor by faith alone; and that our\nrighteousness is completed by works. Therefore I conjure believers, if\nthey know that the true rule of righteousness is to be sought in the\nScripture alone, to accompany me in a serious and solemn examination how\nthe Scripture may be properly reconciled with itself without any\nsophistry. Paul, knowing the righteousness of faith to be the refuge of\nthose who are destitute of any righteousness of their own, boldly infers\nthat all who are justified by faith, are excluded from the righteousness\nof works. It being likewise evident, on the other hand, that this is\ncommon to all believers, he with equal confidence concludes that no man\nis justified by works, but rather, on the contrary, that we are\njustified independently of all works. But it is one thing to dispute\nconcerning the intrinsic value of works, and another, to argue\nrespecting the place they ought to hold after the establishment of the\nrighteousness of faith. If we are to determine the value of works by\ntheir own worthiness, we say that they are unworthy to appear in the\nsight of God; that there is nothing in our works of which we can glory\nbefore God; and consequently, that being divested of all assistance from\nworks, we are justified by faith alone. Now, we describe this\nrighteousness in the following manner: That a sinner, being admitted to\ncommunion with Christ, is by his grace reconciled to God; while, being\npurified by his blood, he obtains remission of sins, and being clothed\nwith his righteousness, as if it were his own, he stands secure before\nthe heavenly tribunal. Where remission of sins has been previously\nreceived, the good works which succeed are estimated far beyond their\nintrinsic merit; for all their imperfections are covered by the\nperfection of Christ, and all their blemishes are removed by his purity,\nthat they may not be scrutinized by the Divine judgment. The guilt,\ntherefore, of all transgressions, by which men are prevented from\noffering any thing acceptable to God being obliterated, and the\nimperfection, which universally deforms even the good works of\nbelievers, being buried in oblivion, their works are accounted\nrighteous, or, which is the same thing, are imputed for righteousness.\nIX. Now, if any one urge this to me as an objection, to oppose the\nrighteousness of faith, I will first ask him, Whether a man is reputed\nrighteous on account of one or two holy works, who is in the other\nactions of his life a transgressor of the law. This would be too absurd\nto be pretended. I shall next inquire, If he is reputed righteous on\naccount of many good works, while he is found guilty of any instance of\ntransgression. This, likewise, my adversary will not presume to\nmaintain, in opposition to the sanction of the law, which denounces a\ncurse on all those who do not fulfil every one of its precepts.[149] I\nwill further inquire, If there is any work which does not deserve the\ncharge of impurity or imperfection.[150] But how could this be possible\nbefore those eyes, in which the stars are not sufficiently pure, nor the\nangels sufficiently righteous? Thus he will be compelled to concede,\nthat there is not a good work to be found, which is not too much\npolluted, both by its own imperfection and by the transgressions with\nwhich it is attended, to have any claim to the honourable appellation of\n_righteousness_. Now, if it be evidently in consequence of justification\nby faith, that works, otherwise impure and imperfect, unworthy of the\nsight of God, and much more of his approbation, are imputed for\nrighteousness,—why do they attempt, by boasting of the righteousness of\nworks, to destroy the righteousness of faith, from which all\nrighteousness of works proceeds? But do they wish to produce a viperous\noffspring to destroy the parent? For such is the true tendency of this\nimpious doctrine. They cannot deny that justification by faith is the\nbeginning, foundation, cause, motive, and substance of the righteousness\nof works; yet they conclude, that a man is not justified by faith\nbecause good works also are imputed for righteousness. Let us therefore\nleave these impertinences, and acknowledge the real state of the case;\nif all the righteousness which can be attributed to works depends on\njustification by faith, the latter is not only not diminished, but, on\nthe contrary, is confirmed by it; since its influence appears the more\nextensive. But let us not suppose that works, subsequent to gratuitous\njustification, are so highly esteemed, that they succeed to the office\nof justifying men, or divide that office with faith. For unless\njustification by faith remain always unimpaired, the impurity of their\nworks will be detected. Nor is there any absurdity in saying, that a man\nis so justified by faith, that he is not only righteous himself, but\nthat even his works are accounted righteous beyond what they deserve.\nX. In this way we will admit, not only a partial righteousness of works,\nwhich our opponents maintain, but such as is approved by God, as though\nit were perfect and complete. A remembrance of the foundation on which\nit stands will solve every difficulty. For no work is ever acceptable,\ntill it be received with pardon. Now, whence proceeds pardon, but from\nGod’s beholding us and all our actions in Christ? When we are ingrafted\ninto Christ, therefore, as our persons appear righteous before God,\nbecause our iniquities are covered by his righteousness, so our works\nare accounted righteous, because the sinfulness otherwise belonging to\nthem is not imputed, being all buried in the purity of Christ. So we may\njustly assert, that not only our persons, but even our works, are\njustified by faith alone. Now, if this righteousness of works, whatever\nbe its nature, is consequent and dependent on faith and gratuitous\njustification, it ought to be included under it, and subordinated to it,\nas an effect to its cause; so far is it from deserving to be exalted,\neither to destroy or to obscure the righteousness of faith. Thus Paul,\nto evince that our blessedness depends on the mercy of God, and not on\nour works, chiefly urges this declaration of David: “Blessed are they\nwhose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is\nthe man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.”[151] If, in opposition to\nthis, the numerous passages be adduced where blessedness seems to be\nattributed to works; such as, “Blessed is the man that feareth the\nLord;[152] that hath mercy on the poor;[153] that walketh not in the\ncounsel of the ungodly;[154] that endureth temptation;”[155] “Blessed\nare they that keep judgment;[156] the undefiled,[157] the poor in\nspirit, the meek, the merciful,” &c.;[158] they will not at all weaken\nthe truth of what is advanced by Paul. For since no man ever attains all\nthese characters, so as thereby to gain the Divine approbation, it\nappears that men are always miserable till they are delivered from\nmisery by the pardon of their sins. Since all the beatitudes celebrated\nin the Scriptures are of no avail, and no man can derive any benefit\nfrom them, till he has obtained blessedness by the remission of his\nsins, which then makes room for the other beatitudes, it follows that\nthis is not merely the noblest and principal, but the only blessedness;\nunless, indeed, we suppose it to be diminished by those which are\ndependent on it. Now, we have much less reason to be disturbed by the\nappellation of _righteous_, which is generally given to believers. I\nacknowledge that they are denominated _righteous_ from the sanctity of\ntheir lives; but as they rather devote themselves to the pursuit of\nrighteousness than actually attain to righteousness itself, it is proper\nthat this righteousness, such as it is, should be subordinate to\njustification by faith, from which it derives its origin.\nXI. But our adversaries say that we have yet more difficulty with James,\nsince he contradicts us in express terms. For he teaches, that “Abraham\nwas justified by works,” and that we are all “justified by works, and\nnot by faith only.”[159] What then? Will they draw Paul into a\ncontroversy with James? If they consider James as a minister of Christ,\nhis declarations must be understood in some sense not at variance with\nChrist when speaking by the mouth of Paul. The Spirit asserts, by the\nmouth of Paul, that Abraham obtained righteousness by faith, not by\nworks; we likewise teach, that we are all justified by faith without the\nworks of the law. The same Spirit affirms by James, that both Abraham’s\nrighteousness and ours consists in works, and not in faith only. That\nthe Spirit is not inconsistent with himself is a certain truth. But what\nharmony can there be between these two apparently opposite assertions?\nOur adversaries would be satisfied, if they could totally subvert the\nrighteousness of faith, which we wish to be firmly established; but to\nafford tranquillity to the disturbed conscience, they feel very little\nconcern. Hence we perceive, that they oppose the doctrine of\njustification by faith, but at the same time fix no certain rule of\nrighteousness, by which the conscience may be satisfied. Let them\ntriumph then as they please, if they can boast no other victory but that\nof having removed all certainty of righteousness. And this miserable\nvictory, indeed, they will obtain, where, after having extinguished the\nlight of truth, they are permitted by the Lord to spread the shades of\nerror. But, wherever the truth of God remains, they will not prevail. I\ndeny, therefore, that the assertion of James, which they hold up against\nus as an impenetrable shield, affords them the least support. To evince\nthis, we shall first examine the scope of the apostle, and then remark\nwherein they are deceived. Because there were many persons at that time,\nand the Church is perpetually infested with similar characters, who, by\nneglecting and omitting the proper duties of believers, manifestly\nbetrayed their real infidelity, while they continued to glory in the\nfalse pretence of faith, James here exposes the foolish confidence of\nsuch persons. It is not his design, then, to diminish, in any respect,\nthe virtue of true faith, but to show the folly of these triflers, who\nwere content with arrogating to themselves the vain image of it, and\nsecurely abandoned themselves to every vice. This statement being\npremised, it will be easy to discover where lies the error of our\nadversaries. For they fall into two fallacies; one respecting the word\n“faith,” the other respecting the word “justification.” When the apostle\ngives the appellation of _faith_ to a vain notion, widely different from\ntrue faith, it is a concession which derogates nothing from the\nargument; this he shows from the beginning in these words: “What doth it\nprofit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not\nworks?”[160] He does not say, If any one have faith without works; but,\nIf any one boast of having it. He speaks still more plainly just after,\nwhere he ridicules it by representing it as worse than the knowledge of\ndevils; and lastly, when he calls it _dead_. But his meaning may be\nsufficiently understood from the definition he gives: “Thou believest,”\nsays he, “that there is one God.” Indeed, if nothing be contained in\nthis creed but a belief of the Divine existence, it is not at all\nsurprising that it is inadequate to justification. And we must not\nsuppose this denial to be derogatory to Christian faith, the nature of\nwhich is widely different. For how does true faith justify, but by\nuniting us to Christ, that, being made one with him, we may participate\nhis righteousness? It does not, therefore, justify us, by attaining a\nknowledge of God’s existence, but by a reliance on the certainty of his\nmercy.\nXII. But we shall not have ascertained the whole scope of the apostle,\ntill we have exposed the other fallacy; for he attributes justification\npartly to works. If we wish to make James consistent with the rest of\nthe Scriptures, and even with himself, we must understand the word\n“justify” in a different signification from that in which it is used by\nPaul. For we are said by Paul to be justified, when the memory of our\nunrighteousness is obliterated, and we are accounted righteous. If James\nhad alluded to this, it would have been preposterous for him to make\nthat quotation from Moses: “Abraham believed God,” &c.[161] For he\nintroduces it in the following manner: Abraham obtained righteousness by\nworks, because he hesitated not to sacrifice his son at the command of\nGod. And thus was the Scripture fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed\nGod, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness. If an effect\nantecedent to its cause be an absurdity, either Moses falsely asserts in\nthat place, that Abraham’s faith was imputed to him for righteousness,\nor Abraham did not obtain righteousness by his obedience, displayed in\nthe oblation of his son. Abraham was justified by faith, while Ishmael,\nwho arrived at adolescence before the birth of Isaac, was not yet\nconceived. How, then, can we ascribe his justification to an act of\nobedience performed so long after? Wherefore, either James improperly\ninverted the order of events, (which it is unlawful to imagine,) or, by\nsaying that Abraham was justified, he did not mean that the patriarch\ndeserved to be accounted righteous. What, then, was his meaning? He\nevidently appears to speak of a declaration of righteousness before men,\nand not of an imputation of it in the sight of God; as though he had\nsaid, They who are justified by true faith, prove their justification,\nnot by a barren and imaginary resemblance of faith, but by obedience and\ngood works. In a word, he is not disputing concerning the method of\njustification, but requiring of believers a righteousness manifested in\ngood works. And as Paul contends for justification independent of works,\nso James will not allow those to be accounted righteous, who are\ndestitute of good works. The consideration of this object will extricate\nus from every difficulty. For the principal mistake of our adversaries\nconsists in supposing, that James describes the method of justification,\nwhile he only endeavours to destroy the corrupt security of those who\nmake vain pretences to faith, in order to excuse their contempt of good\nworks. Into whatever forms, therefore, they pervert the words of James,\nthey will extort nothing but these two truths—that a vain notion of\nfaith cannot justify; and that the faithful, not content with such an\nimagination, manifest their righteousness by their good works.\nXIII. Nor can they derive the least support from a similar passage which\nthey cite from Paul, that “Not the hearers of the law, but the doers of\nthe law, shall be justified.”[162] I have no wish to evade it by the\nexplanation of Ambrose, that this is spoken, because faith in Christ is\nthe fulfilling of the law. For this I conceive to be a mere subterfuge,\nwhich is totally unnecessary. The apostle in that place is demolishing\nthe foolish confidence of the Jews, who boasted of possessing the\nexclusive knowledge of the law, whilst at the same time they were the\ngreatest despisers of it. To prevent such great self-complacence on\naccount of a mere acquaintance with the law, he admonishes them, that if\nrighteousness be sought by the law, it is requisite not only to know but\nto observe it. We certainly do not question that the righteousness of\nthe law consists in works, nor that this righteousness consists in the\nworthiness and merit of works. But still it cannot be proved that we are\njustified by works, unless some person be produced who has fulfilled the\nlaw. That Paul had no other meaning, is sufficiently evident from the\ncontext. After having condemned the Gentiles and Jews indiscriminately\nfor unrighteousness, he proceeds particularly to inform us, that “as\nmany as have sinned without law shall also perish without law;” which\nrefers to the Gentiles; and that “as many as have sinned in the law\nshall be judged by the law;” which belongs to the Jews. Moreover,\nbecause they shut their eyes against their transgressions, and gloried\nin their mere possession of the law, he adds, what is exceedingly\napplicable, that the law was not given that men might be justified\nmerely by hearing its voice, but by obeying it; as though he had said,\nDo you seek righteousness by the law? Plead not your having heard it,\nwhich of itself is a very small advantage, but produce works as an\nevidence that the law has not been given to you in vain. Since in this\nrespect they were all deficient, they were consequently deprived of\ntheir glorying in the law. The meaning of Paul, therefore, rather\nfurnishes an opposite argument: Legal righteousness consists in perfect\nworks; no man can boast of having satisfied the law by his works;\ntherefore there is no righteousness by the law.\nXIV. Our adversaries proceed to adduce those passages in which the\nfaithful boldly offer their righteousness to the examination of Divine\njustice, and desire to be judged according to it. Such are the\nfollowing: “Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and\naccording to mine integrity that is in me.”[163] Again: “Hear the right,\nO Lord. Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night;\nthou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing.”[164] Again: “I have kept\nthe ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. I was\nalso upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. Therefore\nhath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to\nthe cleanness of my hands.”[165] Again: “Judge me, O Lord, for I have\nwalked in mine integrity. I have not sat with vain persons; neither will\nI go in with dissemblers. Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life\nwith bloody men; in whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is\nfull of bribes. But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity.”[166] I\nhave already spoken of the confidence which the saints appear to derive\nfrom their works. The passages now adduced will form no objection to our\ndoctrine, when they are explained according to the occasion of them.\nNow, this is twofold. For believers who have expressed themselves in\nthis manner, have no wish to submit to a general examination, to be\ncondemned or absolved according to the whole tenor of their lives, but\nthey bring forward a particular cause to be judged; and they attribute\nrighteousness to themselves, not with reference to the Divine\nperfection, but in comparison with men of impious and abandoned\ncharacters. In the first place, in order to a man’s being justified, it\nis requisite that he should have, not only a good cause in some\nparticular instance, but a perpetual consistency of righteousness\nthrough life. But the saints, when they implore the judgment of God in\napprobation of their innocence, do not present themselves as free from\nevery charge, and absolutely guiltless; but having fixed their\ndependence on his goodness alone, and confiding in his readiness to\navenge the poor who are unlawfully and unjustly afflicted, they\nsupplicate his regard to the cause in which the innocent are oppressed.\nBut when they place themselves and their adversaries before the Divine\ntribunal, they boast not an innocence, which, on a severe examination,\nwould be found correspondent to the purity of God; but knowing that\ntheir sincerity, justice, simplicity, and purity, are pleasing and\nacceptable to God, in comparison with the malice, wickedness, fraud, and\niniquity of their enemies, they are not afraid to invoke Him to judge\nbetween them. Thus, when David said to Saul, “The Lord render to every\nman his righteousness and his faithfulness”[167] he did not mean that\nthe Lord should examine every individual by himself, and reward him\naccording to his merits; but he called the Lord to witness the greatness\nof his innocence in comparison with the iniquity of Saul. Nor did Paul,\nwhen he gloried in having “the testimony of” his “conscience” that he\nhad conducted himself in the Church “with simplicity and godly\nsincerity,”[168] intend to rely on this before God; but the calumnies of\nthe impious constrained him to oppose all their slanderous aspersions by\nasserting his fidelity and probity, which he knew to be acceptable to\nthe Divine goodness. For we know what he says in another place: “I am\nconscious to myself of nothing; yet am I not hereby justified.”[169]\nBecause, indeed, he was certain, that the judgment of God far\ntranscended the narrow comprehension of man. However, therefore, the\npious may vindicate their innocence against the hypocrisy of the\nimpious, by invoking God to be their witness and judge, yet in their\nconcerns with God alone, they all with one voice exclaim, “If thou,\nLord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?”[170] Again:\n“Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man\nliving be justified.”[171] And, diffident of their own works, they\ngladly sing, “Thy loving-kindness is better than life.”[172]\nXV. There are likewise other passages, similar to the preceding, on\nwhich some person may yet insist. Solomon says, “The just man walketh in\nhis integrity.”[173] Again: “In the way of righteousness there is life;\nand in the pathway thereof there is no death.”[174] Thus also Ezekiel\ndeclares, that he who “doth that which is lawful and right, shall surely\nlive.”[175] We neither deny nor obscure any of these. But let one of the\nsons of Adam produce such an integrity. If no one can, they must either\nperish from the presence of God, or flee to the asylum of mercy. Nor do\nwe deny, that to believers their integrity, however imperfect, is a step\ntoward immortality. But what is the cause of this, unless it be that\nwhen the Lord has admitted any persons into the covenant of his grace,\nhe does not scrutinize their works according to their intrinsic merit,\nbut embraces them with paternal benignity? By this we mean, not merely\nwhat is taught by the schoolmen, “that works receive their value from\nthe grace which accepts them;” for they suppose, that works, otherwise\ninadequate to the attainment of salvation by the legal covenant, are\nrendered sufficient for this by the Divine acceptance of them. But I\nassert, that they are so defiled, both by other transgressions and by\ntheir own blemishes, that they are of no value at all, except as the\nLord pardons both; and this is no other than bestowing on a man\ngratuitous righteousness. It is irrelevant to this subject, to allege\nthose prayers of the apostle, in which he desires such perfection for\nbelievers, that they may be unblamable and irreprovable in the day of\nChrist.[176] These passages, indeed, the Celestines formerly perverted,\nin order to prove a perfection of righteousness in the present life. We\nthink it sufficient briefly to reply, with Augustine, “that all the\npious ought, indeed, to aspire to this object, to appear one day\nimmaculate and guiltless before the presence of God; but since the\nhighest excellency in this life is nothing more than a progress towards\nperfection, we shall never attain it, till, being divested at once of\nmortality and sin, we shall fully adhere to the Lord.” Nevertheless, I\nshall not pertinaciously contend with any person who chooses to\nattribute to the saints the character of perfection, provided he also\ndefines it in the words of Augustine himself; who says, “When we\ndenominate the virtue of the saints perfect, to this perfection itself\nbelongs the acknowledgment of imperfection, both in truth and in\nhumility.”\nFootnote 125:\nDeut. vii. 12, 13.\nFootnote 126:\nJer. vii. 5-7.\nFootnote 127:\nDeut. xi. 26; xxx. 15.\nFootnote 128:\nGal. ii. 16.\nFootnote 129:\nPsalm xix. 12.\nFootnote 130:\nPsalm xxv. 10, 11.\nFootnote 131:\nLev. xviii. 5.\nFootnote 132:\nRom. x. 5, &c.\nFootnote 133:\nActs x. 34, 35.\nFootnote 134:\nGal. v. 5.\nFootnote 135:\nDeut. vii. 9.\nFootnote 136:\n1 Kings viii. 23.\nFootnote 137:\nNeh. i. 5.\nFootnote 138:\nDeut. xxix. 19, 20.\nFootnote 139:\n2 Sam. xxii. 20, 21.\nFootnote 140:\nPsalm xv. 1, 2.\nFootnote 141:\nIsaiah xxxiii. 14, 15.\nFootnote 142:\nDeut. vi. 25.\nFootnote 143:\nDeut. xxiv. 13.\nFootnote 144:\nPsalm cvi. 30, 31.\nFootnote 145:\nRom. viii. 3.\nFootnote 146:\nLuke i. 6.\nFootnote 147:\nRom. iv. 3.

          "title": "CHAPTER XVIII.",
          "content": "JUSTIFICATION BY WORKS NOT TO BE INFERRED FROM THE PROMISE OF A REWARD.\nLet us now proceed to those passages which affirm that “God will render\nto every man according to his deeds;”[177] that “every one may receive\nthe things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it\nbe good or bad.”[178] “Tribulation and anguish upon every soul that\ndoeth evil; but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh\ngood.”[179] And, “All shall come forth; they that have done good, unto\nthe resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the\nresurrection of damnation.”[180] “Come, ye blessed of my Father; for I\nwas a hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me\ndrink,” &c.[181] And with these let us also connect those which\nrepresent eternal life as the reward of works, such as the following:\n“The recompense of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.”[182] “He\nthat feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.”[183] “Rejoice and be\nexceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven.”[184] “Every one\nshall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.”[185] The\ndeclaration, that God will render to every one according to his works,\nis easily explained. For that phrase indicates the order of events,\nrather than the cause of them. But it is beyond all doubt, that the Lord\nproceeds to the consummation of our salvation by these several\ngradations of mercy: “Whom he hath predestinated, them he calls; whom he\nhath called, he justifies; and whom he hath justified, he finally\nglorifies.”[186] Though he receives his children into eternal life,\ntherefore, of his mere mercy, yet since he conducts them to the\npossession of it through a course of good works, that he may fulfil his\nwork in them in the order he has appointed, we need not wonder if they\nare said to be rewarded according to their works, by which they are\nundoubtedly prepared to receive the crown of immortality. And for this\nreason, they are properly said to “work out their own salvation,”[187]\nwhile, devoting themselves to good works, they aspire to eternal life;\njust as in another place they are commanded to “labor for the meat which\nperisheth not,” when they obtain eternal life by believing in Christ;\nand yet it is immediately added, “which the Son of man shall give unto\nyou.”[188] Whence it appears that the word _work_ is not opposed to\ngrace, but refers to human endeavours; and therefore it does not follow,\neither that believers are the authors of their own salvation, or that\nsalvation proceeds from their works. But as soon as they are introduced,\nby the knowledge of the gospel and the illumination of the Holy Spirit,\ninto communion with Christ, eternal life is begun in them. Now, “the\ngood work which” God “hath begun in” them, “he will perform until the\nday of Jesus Christ.”[189] And it is performed, when they prove\nthemselves to be the genuine children of God by their resemblance to\ntheir heavenly Father in righteousness and holiness.\nII. We have no reason to infer from the term _reward_, that good works\nare the cause of salvation. First, let this truth be established in our\nminds, that the kingdom of heaven is not the stipend of servants, but\nthe inheritance of children, which will be enjoyed only by those whom\nthe Lord adopts as his children, and for no other cause than on account\nof this adoption. “For the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with\nthe son of the free-woman.”[190] And, therefore, in the same passages in\nwhich the Holy Spirit promises eternal life as the reward of works, by\nexpressly denominating it “an inheritance,” he proves it to proceed from\nanother cause. Thus Christ enumerates the works which he compensates by\nthe reward of heaven, when he calls the elect to the possession of it;\nbut at the same time adds, that it is to be enjoyed by right of\ninheritance.[191] So Paul encourages servants, who faithfully discharge\ntheir duty, to hope for a reward from the Lord; but at the same time\ncalls it “the reward of the inheritance.”[192] We see how they, almost\nin express terms, caution us against attributing eternal life to works,\ninstead of ascribing it to Divine adoption. Why, then, it may be asked,\ndo they at the same time make mention of works? This question shall be\nelucidated by one example from the Scripture. Before the nativity of\nIsaac, there had been promised to Abraham a seed in whom all the nations\nof the earth were to be blessed, a multiplication of his posterity,\nwhich would equal the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea, and\nother similar blessings.[193] Many years after, in consequence of a\nDivine command, Abraham prepares to sacrifice his son. After this act of\nobedience, he receives this promise: “By myself have I sworn, saith the\nLord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy\nson, thine only son; that in blessing I will bless thee, and in\nmultiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as\nthe sand which is upon the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the\ngate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth\nbe blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.”[194] What? did Abraham\nby his obedience merit that blessing which had been promised him before\nthe command was delivered? Here, then, it appears, beyond all doubt,\nthat the Lord rewards the works of believers with those blessings which\nhe had already given them before their works were thought of, and while\nhe had no reason for his beneficence, but his own mercy.\nIII. Nor does the Lord deceive or trifle with us, when he says that he\nwill requite works with what he had freely given previously to the\nperformance of them. For since it is his pleasure that we be employed in\ngood works, while aspiring after the manifestation or enjoyment of those\nthings which he has promised, and that they constitute the road in which\nwe should travel to endeavour to attain the blessed hope proposed to us\nin heaven, therefore the fruit of the promises, to the perfection of\nwhich fruit those works conduct us, is justly assigned to them. The\napostle beautifully expressed both those ideas, when he said that the\nColossians applied themselves to the duties of charity, “for the hope\nwhich was laid up for them in heaven, whereof they heard before in the\nword, of the truth of the gospel.”[195] For his assertion, that they\nknew from the gospel, that there was hope laid up for them in heaven, is\nequivalent to a declaration that it depended not on any works, but on\nChrist alone; which perfectly accords with the observation of Peter,\nthat believers “are kept by the power of God through faith unto\nsalvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.”[196] When it is said\nthat they must labour for it, it implies, that in order to attain to it,\nbelievers have a race to run, which terminates only with their lives.\nBut that we might not suppose the reward promised us by the Lord to be\nregulated according to the proportion of merit, he proposes a parable,\nin which he has represented himself under the character of a\nhouseholder, who employs all the persons he meets in the cultivation of\nhis vineyard; some he hires at the first hour of the day, others at the\nsecond, others at the third, and some even at the eleventh hour; in the\nevening he pays them all the same wages.[197] A brief and just\nexplanation of this parable is given by the ancient writer, whoever he\nwas, of the treatise “On the Calling of the Gentiles,” which bears the\nname of Ambrose. I shall adopt his words in preference to my own. “By\nthe example of this comparison, (says he,) the Lord has shown a variety\nof manifold vocation pertaining to the same grace. They who, having been\nadmitted into the vineyard at the eleventh hour, are placed on an\nequality with them who had laboured the whole day, represent the state\nof those whom, to magnify the excellence of grace, God, in his mercy,\nhas rewarded in the decline of the day, and at the conclusion of life;\nnot paying them the wages due to their labour, but sending down the\nriches of his goodness, in copious effusions, on them whom he has chosen\nwithout works; that even they who have laboured the most, and have\nreceived no more than the last, may understand theirs to be a reward of\ngrace, not of works.” Lastly, it is also worthy of being observed, that\nin those places where eternal life is called a reward of works, it is\nnot to be understood simply of that communion which we have with God, as\nthe prelude to a happy immortality, when he embraces us in Christ with\npaternal benevolence; but of the possession or fruition of ultimate\nblessedness, as the very words of Christ import—“in the world to come,\neternal life.”[198] And in another place, “Come, inherit the kingdom,”\n&c.[199] For the same reason, Paul applies the term _adoption_ to the\nrevelation of adoption, which shall be made in the resurrection; and\nafterwards explains it to be “the redemption of our body.”[200]\nOtherwise, as alienation from God is eternal death, so when a man is\nreceived into the favour of God so as to enjoy communion with him and\nbecome united to him, he is translated from death to life; which is\nsolely the fruit of adoption. And if they insist, with their accustomed\npertinacity, on the reward of works, we may retort against them that\npassage of Peter, where eternal life is called “the end (or reward) of\nfaith.”[201]\nIV. Let us not, therefore, imagine, that the Holy Spirit by these\npromises commends the worthiness of our works, as though they merited\nsuch a reward. For the Scripture leaves us nothing that can exalt us in\nthe Divine presence. Its whole tendency is rather to repress our\narrogance, and to inspire us with humility, dejection, and contrition.\nBut such promises assist our weakness, which otherwise would immediately\nslide and fall, if it did not sustain itself by this expectation, and\nalleviate its sorrows by this consolation. First, let every one reflect,\nhow difficult it is for a man to relinquish and renounce, not only all\nthat belongs to him, but even himself. And yet this is the first lesson\nwhich Christ teaches his disciples, that is to say, all the pious.\nAfterwards he gives them such tuition during the remainder of their\nlives, under the discipline of the cross, that their hearts may not fix\neither their desires or their dependence on present advantages. In\nshort, he generally manages them in such a manner, that whithersoever\nthey turn their views throughout the world, nothing but despair presents\nitself to them on every side; so that Paul says, “If in this life only\nwe have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.”[202] To\npreserve them from sinking under these afflictions, they have the\npresence of the Lord, who encourages them to raise their heads higher,\nand to extend their views further, by assurances that they will find in\nhim that blessedness which they cannot see in the world. This\nblessedness he calls _a reward_, _a recompense_; not attributing any\nmerit to their works, but signifying that it is a compensation for their\noppressions, sufferings, and disgrace. Wherefore there is no objection\nagainst our following the example of the Scripture in calling eternal\nlife _a reward_; since in that state the Lord receives his people from\nlabor into rest; from affliction into prosperity and happiness; from\nsorrow into joy; from poverty into affluence; from ignominy into glory;\nand commutes all the evils which they have endured for blessings of\nsuperior magnitude. So, likewise, it will occasion no inconvenience, if\nwe consider holiness of life as the way, not which procures our\nadmission into the glory of the heavenly kingdom, but through which the\nelect are conducted by their God to the manifestation of it; since it is\nhis good pleasure to glorify them whom he has sanctified. Only let us\nnot imagine a reciprocal relation of merit and reward, which is the\nerror into which the sophists fell, for want of considering the end\nwhich we have stated. But how preposterous is it, when the Lord calls\nour attention to one end, for us to direct our views to another! Nothing\nis clearer, than that the promise of a reward to good works is designed\nto afford some consolation to the weakness of our flesh, but not to\ninflate our minds with vain-glory. Whoever, therefore, infers from this,\nthat there is any merit in works, or balances the work against the\nreward, errs very widely from the true design of God.\nV. Therefore, when the Scripture says, that “the Lord, the righteous\nJudge, shall give” to his people “a crown of righteousness,”[203] I not\nonly reply with Augustine—“To whom could the righteous Judge have given\na crown, if the Father of mercies had never given grace? and how would\nit have been an act of righteousness, if not preceded by that grace\nwhich justifies the ungodly? how could these due rewards be rendered,\nunless those unmerited blessings were previously bestowed?” but I\nfurther inquire—How could he impute righteousness to our works, unless\nhis indulgent mercy had concealed their unrighteousness? How could he\nesteem them worthy of a reward, unless his infinite goodness had\nabolished all their demerit of punishment? Augustine is in the habit of\ndesignating eternal life by the word _grace_, because, when it is given\nas the reward of works, it is conferred on the gratuitous gifts of God.\nBut the Scripture humbles us more, and at the same time exalts us. For\nbeside prohibiting us to glory in works, because they are the gratuitous\ngifts of God, it likewise teaches us that they are always defiled by\nsome pollutions; so that they cannot satisfy God, if examined according\nto the rule of his judgment; but it is also added, to prevent our\ndespondency, that they please him merely through his mercy. Now, though\nAugustine expresses himself somewhat differently from us, yet that there\nis no real difference of sentiment will appear from his language to\nBoniface. After a comparison between two men, the one of a life holy and\nperfect even to a miracle, the other a man of probity and integrity, yet\nnot so perfect but that many defects might be discovered, he at length\nmakes this inference: “The latter, whose character appears inferior to\nthe former, on account of the true faith in God by which he lives, and\naccording to which he accuses himself in all his delinquencies, and in\nall his good works praises God, ascribing the glory to him, the ignominy\nto himself, and deriving from him both the pardon of his sins and the\nlove of virtue; this man, I say, when delivered from this life, removes\ninto the presence of Christ. Wherefore, but on account of faith? which,\nthough no man be saved by it without works, (for it is not a reprobate\nfaith, but such as works by love,) yet produces remission of sins, for\nthe just lives by faith;[204] but without it, works apparently good are\nperverted into sins.” Here he avows, without any obscurity, that for\nwhich we so strenuously contend—that the righteousness of good works\ndepends on their acceptance by the Divine mercy.\nVI. Very similar to the foregoing passages is the import of the\nfollowing: “Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness;\nthat, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting\nhabitations.”[205] “Charge them that are rich in this world, that they\nbe not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living\nGod; that they do good, that they be rich in good works; laying up in\nstore for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that\nthey may lay hold on eternal life.” [206] Here good works are compared\nto riches, which we may enjoy in the happiness of eternal life. I reply,\nthat we shall never arrive at the true meaning of these passages, unless\nwe advert to the design of the Spirit in such language. If Christ’s\ndeclaration be true, that “where our treasure is, there will our heart\nbe also,”[207]—as the children of this world are generally intent on the\nacquisition of those things which conduce to the comfort of the present\nlife, so it ought to be the concern of believers, after they have been\ntaught that this life will ere long vanish like a dream, to transmit\nthose things which they really wish to enjoy, to that place where they\nshall possess a perfect and permanent life. It behoves us, therefore, to\nimitate the conduct of those who determine to migrate to any new\nsituation, where they have chosen to reside during the remainder of\ntheir lives; they send their property before them, without regarding the\ninconvenience of a temporary absence from it; esteeming their happiness\nthe greater in proportion to the wealth which they possess in the place\nwhich they intend for their permanent residence. If we believe heaven to\nbe our country, it is better for us to transmit our wealth thither, than\nto retain it here, where we may lose it by a sudden removal. But how\nshall we transmit it? Why, if we communicate to the necessities of the\npoor; whatever is bestowed on them, the Lord considers as given to\nhimself.[208] Whence that celebrated promise, “He that hath pity upon\nthe poor, lendeth unto the Lord.”[209] Again: “He which soweth\nbountifully shall reap also bountifully.”[210] For all things that are\nbestowed on our brethren in a way of charity, are so many deposits in\nthe hand of the Lord; which he, as a faithful depositary, will one day\nrestore with ample interest. Are our acts of duty, then, it will be\nasked, so valuable in the sight of God, that they are like riches\nreserved in his hand for us? And who can be afraid to assert this, when\nthe Scripture so frequently and plainly declares it? But if any one,\nfrom the mere goodness of God, would infer the merit of works, these\ntestimonies will afford no countenance to such an error. For we can\ninfer nothing from them except the indulgence which God in his mercy is\ndisposed to show us, since, in order to animate us to rectitude of\nconduct, though the duties we perform are unworthy of the least notice\nfrom him, yet he suffers not one of them to go unrewarded.\nVII. But they insist more on the words of the apostle, who, to console\nthe Thessalonians under their tribulations, tells them that the design\nof their infliction is, “that they may be counted worthy of the kingdom\nof God, for which they also suffer. Seeing,” says he, “it is a righteous\nthing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and\nto you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be\nrevealed from heaven.”[211] And the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews\nsays, “God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love,\nwhich ye have showed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the\nsaints.”[212] To the first passage I reply, That it indicates no\nworthiness of merit; but since it is the will of God the Father, that\nthose whom he has chosen as his children be conformed to Christ his\nfirst begotten Son;[213] as it was necessary for him first to suffer and\nthen to enter into the glory destined for him;[214] so “we must through\nmuch tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.”[215] The tribulations,\ntherefore, which we suffer for the name of Christ, are, as it were,\ncertain marks impressed on us by which God usually distinguishes the\nsheep of his flock. For this reason, then, we are accounted worthy of\nthe kingdom of God, because we bear in our body the marks of our Lord\nand Master,[216] which are the badges of the children of God. The same\nsentiment is conveyed in the following passages: “Bearing about in the\nbody the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be\nmade manifest in our body.”[217] “Being made conformable unto his death,\nif by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.”[218]\nThe reason which the apostle subjoins tends not to establish any merit,\nbut to confirm the hope of the kingdom of God; as though he had said, As\nit is consistent with the judgment of God to avenge on your enemies\nthose vexations with which they have harassed you, so it is also to\ngrant you respite and repose from those vexations. Of the other passage,\nwhich represents it as becoming the righteousness of God not to forget\nour services, so as almost to imply that he would be unrighteous if he\ndid forget them, the meaning is, that in order to arouse our indolence,\nGod has assured us that the labour which we undergo for the glory of his\nname shall not be in vain. And we should always remember that this\npromise, as well as all others, would be fraught with no benefit to us,\nunless it were preceded by the gratuitous covenant of mercy, on which\nthe whole certainty of our salvation must depend. But relying on that\ncovenant, we may securely confide, that our services, however unworthy,\nwill not go without a reward from the goodness of God. To confirm us in\nthat expectation, the apostle asserts that God is not unrighteous, but\nwill perform the promise he has once made. This righteousness,\ntherefore, refers rather to the truth of the Divine promise, than to the\nequity of rendering to us any thing that is our due. To this purpose\nthere is a remarkable observation of Augustine; and as that holy man has\nnot hesitated frequently to repeat it as deserving of remembrance, so I\ndeem it not unworthy of a constant place in our minds. “The Lord,” says\nhe, “is faithful, who has made himself our debtor, not by receiving any\nthing from us, but by promising all things to us.”\nVIII. Our Pharisees adduce the following passages of Paul: “Though I\nhave all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity,\nI am nothing.” Again: “Now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three;\nbut the greatest of these is charity.”[219] Again: “Above all these\nthings, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.”[220] From the\nfirst two passages they contend that we are justified rather by charity\nthan by faith; that is, by the superior virtue, as they express it. But\nthis argument is easily overturned. For we have already shown, that what\nis mentioned in the first passage, has no reference to true faith. The\nsecond we explain to signify true faith, than which he calls charity\ngreater, not as being more meritorious, but because it is more fruitful,\nmore extensive, more generally serviceable, and perpetual in its\nduration; whereas the use of faith is only temporary. In respect of\nexcellence, the preëminence must be given to the love of God, which is\nnot in this place the subject of Paul’s discourse. For the only point\nwhich he urges is, that with reciprocal charity we mutually edify one\nanother in the Lord. But let us suppose that charity excels faith in all\nrespects, yet what person possessed of sound judgment, or even of the\ncommon exercise of reason, would argue from this that it has a greater\nconcern in justification? The power of justifying, attached to faith,\nconsists not in the worthiness of the act. Our justification depends\nsolely on the mercy of God and the merit of Christ, which when faith\napprehends, it is said to justify us. Now, if we ask our adversaries in\nwhat sense they attribute justification to charity, they will reply,\nthat because it is a duty pleasing to God, the merit of it, being\naccepted by the Divine goodness, is imputed to us for righteousness.\nHere we see how curiously their argument proceeds. We assert that faith\njustifies, not by procuring us a righteousness through its own merit,\nbut as the instrument by which we freely obtain the righteousness of\nChrist. These men, passing over in silence the mercy of God, and making\nno mention of Christ, in whom is the substance of righteousness, contend\nthat we are justified by the virtue of charity, because it is more\nexcellent than faith; just as though any one should insist that a king,\nin consequence of his superior rank, is more expert at making a shoe\nthan a shoemaker. This one argument affords an ample proof that all the\nSorbonic schools are destitute of the least experience of justification\nby faith. But if any wrangler should yet inquire, why we understand Paul\nto use the word _faith_ in different acceptations in the same discourse,\nI am prepared with a substantial reason for such an interpretation. For\nsince those gifts which Paul enumerates, are in some respect connected\nwith faith and hope, because they relate to the knowledge of God, he\nsummarily comprises them all under those two words; as though he had\nsaid, The end of prophecy, and of tongues, of knowledge, and of the gift\nof interpretation, is to conduct us to the knowledge of God. But we know\nGod in this life only by hope and faith. Therefore, when I mention faith\nand hope, I comprehend all these things under them. “And now abideth\nfaith, hope, charity, these three;” that is, all gifts, whatever may be\ntheir variety, are referred to these. “But the greatest of these is\ncharity.” From the third passage they infer, that if “charity is the\nbond of perfectness,” it is therefore the bond of righteousness, which\nis no other than perfection. Now, to refrain from observing that what\nPaul calls _perfectness_, is the mutual connection which subsists\nbetween the members of a well-constituted church, and to admit that\ncharity constitutes our perfection before God; yet what new advantage\nwill they gain? On the contrary, I shall always object, that we never\narrive at that perfection, unless we fulfil all the branches of charity;\nand hence I shall infer, that since all men are at an immense distance\nfrom complete charity, they are destitute of all hope of perfection.\nIX. I have no inclination to notice all the passages of Scripture, which\nthe folly of the modern Sorbonists seizes as they occur, and without any\nreason employs against us. For some of them are so truly ridiculous,\nthat I could not even mention them, unless I wished to be accounted a\nfool. I shall therefore conclude this subject after having explained a\nsentence uttered by Christ, with which they are wonderfully pleased. To\na lawyer, who asked him what was necessary to salvation, he replied, “If\nthou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.”[221] What can we wish\nmore, say they, when the Author of grace himself commands to obtain the\nkingdom of heaven by an observance of the commandments? As though it\nwere not evident, that Christ adapted his replies to those with whom he\nconversed. Here a doctor of the law inquires the method of obtaining\nhappiness, and that not simply, but what men must _do_ in order to\nattain it. Both the character of the speaker and the inquiry itself\ninduced the Lord to make this reply. The inquirer, persuaded of the\nrighteousness of the law, possessed a blind confidence in his works.\nBesides, he only inquired what were those works of righteousness by\nwhich salvation might be procured. He is therefore justly referred to\nthe law, which contains a perfect mirror of righteousness. We also\nexplicitly declare, that if life be sought by works, it is indispensably\nrequisite to keep the commandments. And this doctrine is necessary to be\nknown by Christians; for how should they flee for refuge to Christ, if\nthey did not acknowledge themselves to have fallen from the way of life\nupon the precipice of death? And how could they know how far they have\nwandered from the way of life, without a previous knowledge of what that\nway of life is? It is then, therefore, that Christ is presented to them\nas the asylum of salvation, when they perceive the vast difference\nbetween their own lives and the Divine righteousness, which consists in\nthe observance of the law. The sum of the whole is, that if we seek\nsalvation by works, we must keep the commandments, by which we are\ntaught perfect righteousness. But to stop here, would be failing in the\nmidst of our course; for to keep the commandments is a task to which\nnone of us are equal. Being excluded, then, from the righteousness of\nthe law, we are under the necessity of resorting to some other refuge,\nnamely, to faith in Christ. Wherefore, as the Lord, knowing this doctor\nof the law to be inflated with a vain confidence in his works, recalls\nhis attention to the law, that it may teach him his own character as a\nsinner, obnoxious to the tremendous sentence of eternal death, so, in\nanother place, addressing those who have already been humbled under this\nknowledge, he omits all mention of the law, and consoles them with a\npromise of grace—“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,\nand I will give you rest; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”[222]\nX. At length, after our adversaries have wearied themselves with\nperversions of Scripture, they betake themselves to subtleties and\nsophisms. They cavil, that faith is in some places called a work,[223]\nand hence they infer that we improperly oppose faith to works. As though\nfaith procured righteousness for us by its intrinsic merit, as an act of\nobedience to the Divine will, and not rather because, by embracing the\nDivine mercy, it seals to our hearts the righteousness of Christ, which\nthat mercy offers to us in the preaching of the gospel. The reader will\npardon me for not dwelling on the confutation of such follies; for they\nrequire nothing to refute them but their own weakness. But I wish\nbriefly to answer one objection, which has some appearance of reason, to\nprevent its being the source of any difficulty to persons who have had\nbut little experience. Since common sense dictates that opposites are\nsubject to similar rules, and as all sins are imputed to us for\nunrighteousness, they maintain it to be reasonable, on the other hand,\nthat all good works should be imputed to us for righteousness. Those who\nreply, that the condemnation of men proceeds from unbelief alone, and\nnot from particular sins, do not satisfy me. I agree with them, that\nincredulity is the fountain and root of all evils. For it is the\noriginal defection from God, which is afterwards followed by particular\ntransgressions of the law. But as they appear to fix one and the same\nrule for good and evil works in forming a judgment of righteousness or\nunrighteousness, here I am obliged to dissent from them. For the\nrighteousness of works is the perfect obedience of the law. We cannot\ntherefore be righteous by works, unless we follow this straight line\nthroughout the whole of our lives. The first deviation from it is a\nlapse into unrighteousness. Hence it appears that righteousness arises\nnot from one or a few works, but from an inflexible and indefatigable\nobservance of the Divine will. But the rule of judging of\nunrighteousness is very different. For he who has committed fornication\nor theft, is for one transgression liable to the sentence of death,\nbecause he has offended against the divine Majesty. These disputants of\nours, therefore, fall into an error for want of adverting to the\ndecision of James, that “whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet\noffend in one point, he is guilty of all.” For he that said, “Do not\ncommit adultery,” said also, “Do not kill,” &c.[224] It ought not,\ntherefore, to be deemed absurd, when we say, that death is the reward\njustly due to every sin, because they are all and every one deserving of\nthe indignation and vengeance of God. But it will be a weak argument to\ninfer, on the contrary, that one good work will reconcile a man to God,\nwhose wrath he has incurred by a multitude of sins.\nFootnote 177:\nRom. ii. 6.

          "content": "ON CHRISTIAN LIBERTY.\nWe have now to treat of Christian liberty, an explanation of which ought\nnot to be omitted in a treatise which is designed to comprehend a\ncompendious summary of evangelical doctrine. For it is a subject of the\nfirst importance, and unless it be well understood, our consciences\nscarcely venture to undertake any thing without doubting, experience in\nmany things hesitation and reluctance, and are always subject to\nfluctuations and fears. But especially it is an appendix to\njustification, and affords no small assistance towards the knowledge of\nits influence. Hence they who sincerely fear God will experience the\nincomparable advantage of that doctrine, which impious scoffers pursue\nwith their railleries; because in the spiritual intoxication with which\nthey are seized, they allow themselves the most unbounded impudence.\nWherefore this is the proper time to introduce the subject; and though\nwe have slightly touched upon it on some former occasions, yet it was\nuseful to defer the full discussion of it to this place; because, as\nsoon as any mention is made of Christian liberty, then either inordinate\npassions rage, or violent emotions arise, unless timely opposition be\nmade to those wanton spirits, who most nefariously corrupt things which\nare otherwise the best. For some, under the pretext of this liberty,\ncast off all obedience to God, and precipitate themselves into the most\nunbridled licentiousness; and some despise it, supposing it to be\nsubversive of all moderation, order, and moral distinctions. What can we\ndo in this case, surrounded by such difficulties? Shall we entirely\ndiscard Christian liberty, and so preclude the occasion of such dangers?\nBut, as we have observed, unless this be understood, there can be no\nright knowledge of Christ, or of evangelical truth, or of internal peace\nof mind. We should rather exert ourselves to prevent the suppression of\nsuch a necessary branch of doctrine, and at the same time to obviate\nthose absurd objections which are frequently deduced from it.\nII. Christian liberty, according to my judgment, consists of three\nparts. The first part is, that the consciences of believers, when\nseeking an assurance of their justification before God, should raise\nthemselves above the law, and forget all the righteousness of the law.\nFor since the law, as we have elsewhere demonstrated, leaves no man\nrighteous, either we must be excluded from all hope of justification, or\nit is necessary for us to be delivered from it, and that so completely\nas not to have any dependence on works. For he who imagines, that in\norder to obtain righteousness he must produce any works, however small,\ncan fix no limit or boundary, but renders himself a debtor to the whole\nlaw. Avoiding, therefore, all mention of the law, and dismissing all\nthought of our own works, in reference to justification, we must embrace\nthe Divine mercy alone, and turning our eyes from ourselves, fix them\nsolely on Christ. For the question is, not how we can be righteous, but\nhow, though unrighteous and unworthy, we can be considered as righteous.\nAnd the conscience that desires to attain any certainty respecting this,\nmust give no admission to the law. Nor will this authorize any one to\nconclude, that the law is of no use to believers, whom it still\ncontinues to instruct and exhort, and stimulate to duty, although it has\nno place in their consciences before the tribunal of God. For these two\nthings, being very different, require to be properly and carefully\ndistinguished by us. The whole life of Christians ought to be an\nexercise of piety, since they are called to sanctification.[225] It is\nthe office of the law to remind them of their duty, and thereby to\nexcite them to the pursuit of holiness and integrity. But when their\nconsciences are solicitous how God may be propitiated, what answer they\nshall make, and on what they shall rest their confidence, if called to\nhis tribunal, there must then be no consideration of the requisitions of\nthe law, but Christ alone must be proposed for righteousness, who\nexceeds all the perfection of the law.\nIII. On this point turns almost the whole argument of the Epistle to the\nGalatians. For that they are erroneous expositors, who maintain, that\nPaul there contends only for liberty from ceremonies, may be proved from\nthe topics of his reasoning. Such as these: “Christ hath redeemed us\nfrom the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.”[226] Again:\n“Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us\nfree, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Behold, I\nPaul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you\nnothing. Every man that is circumcised is a debtor to do the whole law.\nChrist is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified\nby the law; ye are fallen from grace.”[227] These passages certainly\ncomprehend something more exalted than a freedom from ceremonies. I\nconfess, indeed, that Paul is there treating of ceremonies, because he\nis contending with the false apostles, who attempted to introduce again\ninto the Christian Church the ancient shadows of the law, which had been\nabolished by the advent of Christ. But for the decision of this question\nit was necessary to discuss some higher topics, in which the whole\ncontroversy lay. First, because the brightness of the gospel was\nobscured by those Jewish shadows, he shows that in Christ we have a\ncomplete exhibition of all those things which were adumbrated by the\nceremonies of Moses. Secondly, because these impostors instilled into\nthe people the very pernicious opinion, that this ceremonial obedience\nwas sufficient to merit the Divine favour, he principally contends, that\nbelievers ought not to suppose that they can obtain righteousness before\nGod by any works of the law, much less by those inferior elements. And\nhe at the same time teaches, that from the condemnation of the law,\nwhich otherwise impends over all men, they are delivered by the cross of\nChrist, that they may rely with perfect security on him alone—a topic\nwhich properly belongs to our present subject. Lastly, he asserts the\nliberty of the consciences of believers, which ought to be laid under no\nobligation in things that are not necessary.\nIV. The second part of Christian liberty, which is dependent on the\nfirst, is, that their consciences do not observe the law, as being under\nany legal obligation; but that, being liberated from the yoke of the\nlaw, they yield a voluntary obedience to the will of God. For being\npossessed with perpetual terrors, as long as they remain under the\ndominion of the law, they will never engage with alacrity and\npromptitude in the service of God, unless they have previously received\nthis liberty. We shall more easily and clearly discover the design of\nthese things from an example. The precept of the law is, “Thou shalt\nlove the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and\nwith all thy might.”[228] That this command may be fulfilled, our soul\nmust be previously divested of every other perception and thought, our\nheart must be freed from all desires, and our might must be collected\nand contracted to this one point. Those who, compared with others, have\nmade a very considerable progress in the way of the Lord, are yet at an\nimmense distance from this perfection. For though they love God with\ntheir soul, and with sincere affection of heart, yet they have still\nmuch of their heart and soul occupied by carnal desires, which retard\ntheir progress towards God. They do indeed press forward with strong\nexertions, but the flesh partly debilitates their strength, and partly\nattracts it to itself. What can they do in this case, when they perceive\nthat they are so far from observing the law? They wish, they aspire,\nthey endeavour, but they do nothing with the perfection that is\nrequired. If they advert to the law, they see that every work they\nattempt or meditate is accursed. Nor is there the least reason for any\nperson to deceive himself, by concluding that an action is not\nnecessarily altogether evil, because it is imperfect, and that therefore\nthe good part of it is accepted by God. For the law, requiring perfect\nlove, condemns all imperfection, unless its rigour be mitigated. Let him\nconsider his work, therefore, which he wished to be thought partly good,\nand he will find that very work to be a transgression of the law,\nbecause it is imperfect.\nV. See how all our works, if estimated according to the rigour of the\nlaw, are subject to its curse. How, then, could unhappy souls apply\nthemselves with alacrity to any work for which they could expect to\nreceive nothing but a curse? On the contrary, if they are liberated from\nthe severe exaction of the law, or rather from the whole of its rigour,\nand hear God calling them with paternal gentleness, then with\ncheerfulness and prompt alacrity they will answer to his call and follow\nhis guidance. In short, they who are bound by the yoke of the law, are\nlike slaves who have certain daily tasks appointed by their masters.\nThey think they have done nothing, and presume not to enter into the\npresence of their masters without having finished the work prescribed to\nthem. But children, who are treated by their parents in a more liberal\nmanner, hesitate not to present to them their imperfect, and in some\nrespects faulty works, in confidence that their obedience and\npromptitude of mind will be accepted by them, though they have not\nperformed all that they wished. Such children ought we to be, feeling a\ncertain confidence that our services, however small, rude, and\nimperfect, will be approved by our most indulgent Father. This he also\nconfirms to us by the prophet: “I will spare them,” saith he, “as a man\nspareth his own son that serveth him;”[229] where it is evident, from\nthe mention of _service_, that the word _spare_ is used to denote\nindulgence, or an overlooking of faults. And we have great need of this\nconfidence, without which all our endeavours will be vain; for God\nconsiders us as serving him in none of our works, but such as are truly\ndone by us to his honour. But how can this be done amidst those terrors,\nwhere it is a matter of doubt whether our works offend God or honour\nhim?\nVI. This is the reason why the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews\nrefers to faith, and estimates only by faith, all the good works which\nare recorded of the holy patriarchs.[230] On this liberty there is a\nremarkable passage in the Epistle to the Romans, where Paul reasons that\nsin ought not to have dominion over us, because we are not under the\nlaw, but under grace.[231] For after he had exhorted believers, “Let not\nsin, therefore, reign in your mortal body; neither yield ye your members\nas instruments of unrighteousness; but yield yourselves unto God, as\nthose that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of\nrighteousness unto God,”[232]—they might, on the contrary, object that\nthey yet carried about with them the flesh full of inordinate desires,\nand that sin dwelt in them; but he adds the consolation furnished by\ntheir liberty from the law; as though he had said, Although you do not\nyet experience sin to be destroyed, and righteousness living in you in\nperfection, yet you have no cause for terror and dejection of mind, as\nif God were perpetually offended on account of your remaining sin;\nbecause by grace you are emancipated from the law, that your works may\nnot be judged according to that rule. But those, who infer that we may\ncommit sin because we are not under the law, may be assured that they\nhave no concern with this liberty, the end of which is to animate us to\nvirtue.\nVII. The third part of Christian liberty teaches us, that we are bound\nby no obligation before God respecting external things, which in\nthemselves are indifferent; but that we may indifferently sometimes use,\nand at other times omit them. And the knowledge of this liberty also is\nvery necessary for us; for without it we shall have no tranquillity of\nconscience, nor will there be any end of superstitions. Many in the\npresent age think it a folly to raise any dispute concerning the free\nuse of meats, of days, and of habits, and similar subjects, considering\nthese things as frivolous and nugatory; but they are of greater\nimportance than is generally believed. For when the conscience has once\nfallen into the snare, it enters a long and inextricable labyrinth, from\nwhich it is afterwards difficult to escape; if a man begin to doubt the\nlawfulness of using flax in sheets, shirts, handkerchiefs, napkins, and\ntable cloths, neither will he be certain respecting hemp, and at last he\nwill doubt of the lawfulness of using tow; for he will consider with\nhimself whether he cannot eat without table cloths or napkins, whether\nhe cannot do without handkerchiefs. If any one imagine delicate food to\nbe unlawful, he will ere long have no tranquillity before God in eating\nbrown bread and common viands, while he remembers that he might support\nhis body with meat of a quality still inferior. If he hesitate\nrespecting good wine, he will afterwards be unable with any peace of\nconscience to drink the most vapid; and at last he will not presume even\nto touch purer and sweeter water than others. In short, he will come to\nthink it criminal to step over a twig that lies across his path. For\nthis is the commencement of no trivial controversy; but the dispute is\nwhether the use of certain things be agreeable to God, whose will ought\nto guide all our resolutions and all our actions. The necessary\nconsequence is, that some are hurried by despair into a vortex of\nconfusion, from which they see no way of escape; and some, despising\nGod, and casting off all fear of him, make a way of ruin for themselves.\nFor all, who are involved in such doubts, which way soever they turn\ntheir views, behold something offensive to their consciences presenting\nitself on every side.\nVIII. “I know,” says Paul, “that there is nothing unclean of itself; but\nto him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is\nunclean.”[233] In these words he makes all external things subject to\nour liberty, provided that our minds have regard to this liberty before\nGod. But if any superstitious notion cause us to scruple, those things\nwhich were naturally pure become contaminated to us. Wherefore he\nsubjoins, “Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that which he\nalloweth. And he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth\nnot of faith; for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”[234] Are not they,\nwho in these perplexities show their superior boldness by the security\nof their presumption, guilty of departing from God? whilst they who are\ndeeply affected with the true fear of God, when they are even\nconstrained to admit many things to which their own consciences are\naverse, are filled with terror and consternation. No persons of this\ndescription receive any of the gifts of God with thanksgiving, by which\nalone Paul, nevertheless, declares them to be all sanctified to our\nuse.[235] I mean a thanksgiving proceeding from a mind which\nacknowledges the beneficence and goodness of God in the blessings he\nbestows. For many of them, indeed, apprehend the good things which they\nuse to be from God, whom they praise in his works; but not being\npersuaded that they are _given_ to them, how could they give thanks to\nGod as the giver of them? We see, in short, the tendency of this\nliberty, which is, that without any scruple of conscience or\nperturbation of mind, we should devote the gifts of God to that use for\nwhich he has given them; by which confidence our souls may have peace\nwith him, and acknowledge his liberality towards us. For this\ncomprehends all ceremonies, the observation of which is left free, that\nthe conscience may not be bound by any obligation to observe them, but\nmay remember that by the goodness of God it may use them, or abstain\nfrom them, as shall be most conducive to edification.\nIX. Now, it must be carefully observed, that Christian liberty is in all\nits branches a spiritual thing; all the virtue of which consists in\nappeasing terrified consciences before God, whether they are disquieted\nand solicitous concerning the remission of their sins, or are anxious to\nknow if their works, which are imperfect and contaminated by the\ndefilements of the flesh, be acceptable to God; or are tormented\nconcerning the use of things that are indifferent. Wherefore they are\nguilty of perverting its meaning, who either make it the pretext of\ntheir irregular appetites, that they may abuse the Divine blessings to\nthe purposes of sensuality, or who suppose that there is no liberty but\nwhat is used before men, and therefore in the exercise of it totally\ndisregard their weak brethren. The former of these sins is the more\ncommon in the present age. There is scarcely any one, whom his wealth\npermits to be sumptuous, who is not delighted with luxurious splendour\nin his entertainments, in his dress, and in his buildings; who does not\ndesire a preëminence in every species of luxury; who does not strangely\nflatter himself on his elegance. And all these things are defended under\nthe pretext of Christian liberty. They allege that they are things\nindifferent; this I admit, provided they be indifferently used. But\nwhere they are too ardently coveted, proudly boasted, or luxuriously\nlavished, these things, of themselves otherwise indifferent, are\ncompletely polluted by such vices. This passage of Paul makes an\nexcellent distinction respecting things which are indifferent: “Unto the\npure all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving\nis nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.”[236]\nFor why are curses denounced on rich men, who “receive their\nconsolation,” who are “satiated,” who “now laugh,” who “lie on beds of\nivory,” who “join field to field,” who “have the harp, and the lyre, and\nthe tabret, and wine in their feasts?”[237] Ivory and gold, and riches\nof all kinds, are certainly blessings of Divine Providence, not only\npermitted, but expressly designed for the use of men; nor are we any\nwhere prohibited to laugh, or to be satiated with food, or to annex new\npossessions to those already enjoyed by ourselves or by our ancestors,\nor to be delighted with musical harmony, or to drink wine. This indeed\nis true; but amidst an abundance of all things, to be immersed in\nsensual delights, to inebriate the heart and mind with present\npleasures, and perpetually to grasp at new ones,—these things are very\nremote from a legitimate use of the Divine blessings. Let them banish,\ntherefore, immoderate cupidity, excessive profusion, vanity, and\narrogance; that with a pure conscience they may make a proper use of the\ngifts of God. When their hearts shall be formed to this sobriety, they\nwill have a rule for the legitimate enjoyment of them. On the contrary,\nwithout this moderation, even common and ordinary pleasures are\nchargeable with excess. For it is truly observed, that a proud heart\nfrequently dwells under coarse and ragged garments, and that simplicity\nand humility are sometimes concealed under purple and fine linen. Let\nall men, in their respective stations, whether of poverty, of\ncompetence, or of splendour, live in the remembrance of this truth, that\nGod confers his blessings on them for the support of life, not for\nluxury; and let them consider this as the law of Christian liberty, that\nthey learn the lesson which Paul had learned, when he said, “I have\nlearned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both\nhow to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all\nthings I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound\nand to suffer need.”[238]\nX. Many persons err likewise in this respect, that, as if their liberty\nwould not be perfectly secure unless witnessed by men, they make an\nindiscriminate and imprudent use of it—a disorderly practice, which\noccasions frequent offence to their weak brethren. There are some to be\nfound, in the present day, who imagine their liberty would be abridged,\nif they were not to enter on the enjoyment of it by eating animal food\non Friday. Their eating is not the subject of my reprehension; but their\nminds require to be divested of this false notion; for they ought to\nconsider, that they obtain no advantage from their liberty before men,\nbut with God; and that it consists in abstinence as well as in use. If\nthey apprehend it to be immaterial in God’s view, whether they eat\nanimal food or eggs, whether their garments be scarlet or black, it is\nquite sufficient. The conscience, to which the benefit of this liberty\nwas due, is now emancipated. Therefore, though they abstain from flesh,\nand wear but one color, during all the rest of their lives, this is no\ndiminution of their freedom. Nay, because they are free, they therefore\nabstain with a free conscience. But they fall into a very pernicious\nerror in disregarding the infirmity of their brethren, which it becomes\nus to bear, so as not rashly to do any thing which would give them the\nleast offence. But it will be said, that it is sometimes right to assert\nour liberty before men. This I confess; yet the greatest caution and\nmoderation must be observed, lest we cast off all concern for the weak,\nwhom God has so strongly recommended to our regards.\nXI. I shall now, therefore, make some observations concerning offences;\nhow they are to be discriminated, what are to be avoided, and what are\nto be disregarded; whence we may afterwards determine what room there is\nfor our liberty in our intercourse with mankind. I approve of the common\ndistinction between an offence given and an offence taken, since it is\nplainly countenanced by Scripture, and is likewise sufficiently\nsignificant of the thing intended to be expressed. If you do any thing\nat a wrong time or place, or with an unseasonable levity, or wantonness,\nor temerity, by which the weak and inexperienced are offended, it must\nbe termed an offence given by you; because it arises from your fault.\nAnd an offence is always said to be given in any action, the fault of\nwhich proceeds from the performer of that action. An offence taken is,\nwhen any transaction, not otherwise unseasonable or culpable, is,\nthrough malevolence, or some perverse disposition, construed into an\noccasion of offence. For in this instance the offence is not given, but\ntaken without reason by such perverseness of construction. The first\nspecies of offence affects none but the weak; the second is created by\nmoroseness of temper, and Pharisaical superciliousness. Wherefore we\nshall denominate the former, the offence of the weak, the latter, that\nof Pharisees; and we shall so temper the use of our liberty, that it\nought to submit to the ignorance of weak brethren, but not at all to the\nausterity of Pharisees. For our duty to the weak, Paul fully shows in\nmany places. “Him that is weak in the faith receive ye.” Again: “Let us\nnot therefore judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no\nman put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his brother’s\nway;”[239] and much more to the same import, which were better examined\nin its proper connection than recited here. The sum of all is, that “we,\nthen, that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and\nnot to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbour for\nhis good to edification.”[240] In another place: “But take heed lest by\nany means this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to them that\nare weak.”[241] Again: “Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat;\nasking no questions for conscience’ sake; conscience, I say, not thine\nown, but of the other.” In short, “Give none offence, neither to the\nJews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.”[242] In another\nplace also: “Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not\nliberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one\nanother.”[243] The meaning of this is, that our liberty is not given us\nto be used in opposition to our weak neighbours, to whom charity obliges\nus to do every possible service; but rather in order that, having peace\nwith God in our minds, we may also live peaceably among men. But how\nmuch attention should be paid to an offence taken by Pharisees, we learn\nfrom our Lord’s injunction, “Let them alone; they be blind leaders of\nthe blind.”[244] The disciples had informed him, that the Pharisees were\noffended with his discourse. He replies that they are to be let alone,\nand their offence disregarded.\nXII. But the subject is still pending in uncertainty, unless we know\nwhom we are to account weak, and whom we are to consider as Pharisees;\nwithout which distinction, I see no use of liberty in the midst of\noffences, but such as must be attended with the greatest danger. But\nPaul appears to me to have very clearly decided, both by doctrine and\nexamples, how far our liberty should be either moderated or asserted on\nthe occurrence of offences. When he made Timothy his associate, he\ncircumcised him;[245] but could not be induced to circumcise Titus.[246]\nHere was a difference in his proceedings, but no change of mind or of\npurpose. In the circumcision of Timothy, “though he was free from all\nmen, yet he made himself servant unto all;” and says he, “Unto the Jews\nI became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under\nthe law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the\nlaw: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save\nsome.”[247] Thus we have a proper moderation of liberty, if it may be\nindifferently restricted with any advantage. His reason for resolutely\nrefraining from circumcising Titus, he declares in the following words:\n“But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be\ncircumcised; and that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who\ncame in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus,\nthat they might bring us into bondage; to whom we gave place by\nsubjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might\ncontinue with you.”[248] We also are under the necessity of vindicating\nour liberty, if it be endangered in weak consciences by the iniquitous\nrequisitions of false apostles. We must at all times study charity, and\nkeep in view the edification of our neighbour. “All things (says Paul)\nare lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are\nlawful for me, but all things edify not. Let no man seek his own, but\nevery man another’s.”[249] Nothing can be plainer than this rule, that\nour liberty should be used, if it conduces to our neighbour’s\nedification; but that if it be not beneficial to our neighbour, it\nshould be abridged. There are some, who pretend to imitate the prudence\nof Paul in refraining from the exercise of liberty, while they are doing\nany thing but exercising the duties of charity. For to promote their own\ntranquillity, they wish all mention of liberty to be buried; whereas it\nis no less advantageous to our neighbours sometimes to use our liberty\nto their benefit and edification, than at other times to moderate it for\ntheir accommodation. But a pious man considers this liberty in external\nthings as granted him in order that he may be the better prepared for\nall the duties of charity.\nXIII. But whatever I have advanced respecting the avoidance of offences,\nI wish to be referred to indifferent and unimportant things; for\nnecessary duties must not be omitted through fear of any offence: as our\nliberty should be subject to charity, so charity itself ought to be\nsubservient to the purity of faith. It becomes us, indeed, to have\nregard to charity; but we must not offend God for the love of our\nneighbour. We cannot approve the intemperance of those who do nothing\nbut in a tumultuous manner, and who prefer violent measures to lenient\nones. Nor must we listen to those, who, while they show themselves the\nleaders in a thousand species of impiety, pretend that they are obliged\nto act in such a manner, that they may give no offence to their\nneighbours; as though they are not at the same time fortifying the\nconsciences of their neighbours in sin; especially since they are always\nsticking in the same mire without any hope of deliverance. And whether\ntheir neighbour is to be instructed by doctrine or by example, they\nmaintain that he ought to be fed with milk, though they are infecting\nhim with the worst and most pernicious notions. Paul tells the\nCorinthians, “I have fed you with milk;”[250] but if the Popish mass had\nbeen then introduced among them, would he have united in that pretended\nsacrifice in order to feed them with milk? Certainly not; for milk is\nnot poison. They are guilty of falsehood, therefore, in saying that they\nfeed those whom they cruelly murder under the appearance of such\nflatteries. But admitting that such dissimulation is to be approved for\na time, how long will they feed their children with the same milk? For\nif they never grow, so as to be able to bear even some light meat, it is\na clear proof that they were never fed with milk. I am prevented from\npushing this controversy with them any further at present, by two\nreasons—first, because their absurdities scarcely deserve a refutation,\nbeing justly despised by all men of sound understanding; secondly,\nhaving done this at large in particular treatises, I am unwilling to\ntravel the same ground over again. Only let the readers remember, that\nwith whatever offences Satan and the world may endeavour to divert us\nfrom the ordinances of God, or to retard our pursuit of what he enjoins,\nyet we must nevertheless strenuously advance; and moreover, that\nwhatever dangers threaten us, we are not at liberty to deviate even a\nhair’s breadth from his command, and that it is not lawful under any\npretext to attempt any thing but what he permits.\nXIV. Now, since the consciences of believers, being privileged with the\nliberty which we have described, have been delivered by the favour of\nChrist from all necessary obligation to the observance of those things\nin which the Lord has been pleased they should be left free, we conclude\nthat they are exempt from all human authority. For it is not right that\nChrist should lose the acknowledgments due to such kindness, or our\nconsciences the benefit of it. Neither is that to be accounted a trivial\nthing, which we see cost Christ so much; which he estimated not with\ngold or silver, but with his own blood;[251] so that Paul hesitates not\nto assert, that his death is rendered vain, if we suffer our souls to be\nin subjection to men.[252] For his sole object in some chapters of his\nEpistle to the Galatians is to prove that Christ is obscured, or rather\nabolished, with respect to us, unless our consciences continue in their\nliberty; from which they are certainly fallen, if they can be insnared\nin the bonds of laws and ordinances at the pleasure of men.[253] But as\nit is a subject highly worthy of being understood, so it needs a more\ndiffuse and perspicuous explanation. For as soon as a word is mentioned\nconcerning the abrogation of human establishments, great tumults are\nexcited, partly by seditious persons, partly by cavillers; as though all\nobedience of men were at once subverted and destroyed.\nXV. To prevent any one from falling into this error, let us therefore\nconsider, in the first place, that man is under two kinds of\ngovernment—one spiritual, by which the conscience is formed to piety and\nthe service of God; the other political, by which a man is instructed in\nthe duties of humanity and civility, which are to be observed in an\nintercourse with mankind. They are generally, and not improperly,\ndenominated the spiritual and the temporal jurisdiction; indicating that\nthe former species of government pertains to the life of the soul, and\nthat the latter relates to the concerns of the present state; not only\nto the provision of food and clothing, but to the enactment of laws to\nregulate a man’s life among his neighbours by the rules of holiness,\nintegrity, and sobriety. For the former has its seat in the interior of\nthe mind, whilst the latter only directs the external conduct: one may\nbe termed a spiritual kingdom, and the other a political one. But these\ntwo, as we have distinguished them, always require to be considered\nseparately; and while the one is under discussion, the mind must be\nabstracted from all consideration of the other. For man contains, as it\nwere, two worlds, capable of being governed by various rulers and\nvarious laws. This distinction will prevent what the gospel inculcates\nconcerning spiritual liberty from being misapplied to political\nregulations; as though Christians were less subject to the external\ngovernment of human laws, because their consciences have been set at\nliberty before God; as though their freedom of spirit necessarily\nexempted them from all carnal servitude. Again, because even in those\nconstitutions which seem to pertain to the spiritual kingdom, there may\npossibly be some deception, it is necessary to discriminate between\nthese also; which are to be accounted legitimate, as according with the\nDivine word, and which, on the contrary, ought not to be received among\nbelievers. Of civil government I shall treat in another place. Of\necclesiastical laws also I forbear to speak at present; because a full\ndiscussion of them will be proper in the Fourth Book, where we shall\ntreat of the power of the Church. But we shall conclude the present\nargument in the following manner: The question, which, as I have\nobserved, is in itself not very obscure or intricate, greatly perplexes\nmany, because they do not distinguish with sufficient precision between\nthe external jurisdiction and the court of conscience. The difficulty is\nincreased by Paul’s injunction to obey magistrates “not only for wrath,\nbut also for conscience’ sake;”[254] from which it should follow, that\nthe conscience also is bound by political laws. But if this were true,\nit would supersede all that we have already said, or are now about to\nsay, respecting spiritual government. For the solution of this\ndifficulty, it will be of use, first, to know what conscience is. And\nthe definition of it must be derived from the etymology of the word. For\nas, when men apprehend the knowledge of things in the mind and\nunderstanding, they are thence said _scire_, “to know,” whence is\nderived the word _scientia_, “science” or “knowledge;” so when they have\na sense of Divine justice, as an additional witness, which permits them\nnot to conceal their sins, or to elude accusation at the tribunal of the\nsupreme Judge, this sense is termed _conscientia_, “conscience.” For it\nis a kind of medium between God and man; because it does not suffer a\nman to suppress what he knows within himself, but pursues him till it\nbrings him to conviction. This is what Paul means by “their conscience\nalso bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing, or else excusing, one\nanother.”[255] Simple knowledge might remain, as it were, confined\nwithin a man. This sentiment, therefore, which places man before the\nDivine tribunal, is appointed, as it were, to watch over man, to observe\nand examine all his secrets, that nothing may remain enveloped in\ndarkness. Hence the old proverb, Conscience is as a thousand witnesses.\nFor the same reason Peter speaks of “the answer of a good conscience\ntowards God,”[256] to express our tranquillity of mind, when, persuaded\nof the favour of Christ, we present ourselves with boldness in the\npresence of God. And the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews expresses\nabsolution or freedom from every future charge of sin, by “having no\nmore conscience of sin.”[257]\nXVI. Therefore, as works respect men, so conscience regards God; so that\na good conscience is no other than inward integrity of heart. In which\nsense Paul says, that “the end of the commandment is charity, out of a\npure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.”[258]\nAfterwards also, in the same chapter, he shows how widely it differs\nfrom understanding, saying, that “some, having put away a good\nconscience, concerning faith have made shipwreck.”[259] For these words\nindicate that it is a lively inclination to the service of God, and a\nsincere pursuit of piety and holiness of life. Sometimes, indeed, it is\nlikewise extended to men; as when the same apostle declares, “Herein do\nI exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward\nGod and toward men.”[260] But the reason of this assertion is, that the\nfruits of a good conscience reach even to men. But in strict propriety\nof speech it has to do with God alone, as I have already observed. Hence\nit is that a law, which simply binds a man without relation to other\nmen, or any consideration of them, is said to bind the conscience. For\nexample, God not only enjoins the preservation of the mind chaste and\npure from every libidinous desire, but prohibits all obscenity of\nlanguage and external lasciviousness. The observance of this law is\nincumbent on my conscience, though there were not another man existing\nin the world. Thus he who transgresses the limits of temperance, not\nonly sins by giving a bad example to his brethren, but contracts guilt\non his conscience before God. Things in themselves indifferent are to be\nguided by other considerations. It is our duty to abstain from them, if\nthey tend to the least offence, yet without violating our liberty of\nconscience. So Paul speaks concerning meat consecrated to idols: “If any\nman say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice to idols, eat not for\nconscience’ sake; conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the\nother.”[261] A pious man would be guilty of sin, who, being previously\nadmonished, should, nevertheless, eat such meat. But though, with\nrespect to his brother, abstinence is necessary for him, as it is\nenjoined by God, yet he ceases not to retain liberty of conscience. We\nsee, then, how this law, though it binds the external action, leaves the\nconscience free.\nFootnote 225:\nEphes. i. 4. 1 Thess. iv. 3, 7.\nFootnote 226:\nGal. iii. 13.\nFootnote 227:\nGal. v. 1-4.\nFootnote 228:\nDeut. vi. 5.\nFootnote 229:\nMal. iii. 17.\nFootnote 230:\nHeb. xi. 2.\nFootnote 231:\nRom. vi. 14.\nFootnote 232:\nRom. vi. 12, 13.\nFootnote 233:\nRom. xiv. 14.\nFootnote 234:\nRom. xiv. 22, 23.\nFootnote 235:\n1 Tim. iv. 5.\nFootnote 236:\nTitus i. 15.\nFootnote 237:\nLuke vi. 24, 25.

          "title": "CHAPTER XX.",
          "content": "ON PRAYER, THE PRINCIPAL EXERCISE OF FAITH, AND THE MEDIUM OF OUR DAILY\nRECEPTION OF DIVINE BLESSINGS.\nFrom the subjects already discussed, we clearly perceive how utterly\ndestitute man is of every good, and in want of all the means of\nsalvation. Wherefore, if he seek for relief in his necessities, he must\ngo out of himself, and obtain it from some other quarter. It has been\nsubsequently stated, that the Lord voluntarily and liberally manifests\nhimself in his Christ, in whom he offers us all felicity instead of our\nmisery, and opulence instead of our poverty; in whom he opens to our\nview the treasures of heaven, that our faith may be wholly engaged in\nthe contemplation of his beloved Son, that all our expectation may\ndepend upon him, and that in him all our hope may rest and be fully\nsatisfied. This, indeed, is that secret and recondite philosophy, which\ncannot be extracted from syllogisms; but is well understood by those\nwhose eyes God has opened, that in his light they may see light. But\nsince we have been taught by faith to acknowledge, that whatever we want\nfor the supply of our necessities is in God and our Lord Jesus Christ,\nin whom it has pleased the Father all the fulness of his bounty should\ndwell, that we may all draw from it, as from a most copious fountain, it\nremains for us to seek in him, and by prayers to implore of him, that\nwhich we have been informed resides in him. Otherwise to know God as the\nLord and Giver of every good, who invites us to supplicate him, but\nneither to approach him nor to supplicate him, would be equally\nunprofitable, as for a man to neglect a treasure discovered to him\nburied in the earth. Wherefore the apostle, to show that true faith\ncannot but be engaged in calling upon God, has laid down this\norder—that, as faith is produced by the gospel, so by faith our hearts\nare brought to invoke the name of the Lord.[262] And this is the same as\nhe had a little before said, that the “Spirit of adoption,” who seals\nthe testimony of the gospel in our hearts, encourages our spirits, so\nthat they venture to pour out their desires before God, excite\n“groanings that cannot be uttered,” and cry with confidence, “Abba,\nFather.”[263] This last subject, therefore, having been before only\ncursorily mentioned and slightly touched, requires now to be treated\nmore at large.\nII. By means of prayer, then, we penetrate to those riches which are\nreserved with our heavenly Father for our use. For between God and men\nthere is a certain communication; by which they enter into the sanctuary\nof heaven, and in his immediate presence remind him of his promises, in\norder that his declarations, which they have implicitly believed, may in\ntime of necessity be verified in their experience. We see, therefore,\nthat nothing is revealed to us, to be expected from the Lord, for which\nwe are not likewise enjoined to pray; so true is it, that prayer digs\nout those treasures, which the gospel of the Lord discovers to our\nfaith. Now, the necessity and various utility of the exercise of prayer\nno language can sufficiently explain. It is certainly not without reason\nthat our heavenly Father declares, that the only fortress of salvation\nconsists in invocation of his name; by which we call to our aid the\npresence of his providence, which watches over all our concerns; of his\npower, which supports us when weak and ready to faint; and of his\ngoodness, which receives us into favour, though miserably burdened with\nsins; in which, finally, we call upon him to manifest his presence with\nus in all his attributes. Hence our consciences derive peculiar peace\nand tranquillity; for when the affliction which oppressed us is\nrepresented to the Lord, we feel abundant composure even from this\nconsideration—that none of our troubles are concealed from him, whom we\nknow to possess both the greatest readiness and the greatest ability to\npromote our truest interest.\nIII. But some will say, Does he not, without information, know both our\ntroubles and our necessities; so that it may appear unnecessary to\nsolicit him with our prayers, as if he were inattentive or sleeping,\ntill aroused by our voice? But such reasoners advert not to the Lord’s\nend in teaching his people to pray; for he has appointed it not so much\nfor his own sake as for ours. It is his pleasure indeed, as is highly\nreasonable, that his right be rendered to him, by their considering him\nas the Author of all that is desired and found useful by men, and by\ntheir acknowledgments of this in their prayers. But the utility of this\nsacrifice, by which he is worshipped, returns to us. The greater the\nconfidence, therefore, with which the ancient saints gloried in the\nDivine benefits to themselves and others, with so much the more\nearnestness were they incited to pray. The single example of Elijah\nshall suffice, who, though certain of God’s design, having already with\nsufficient authority promised rain to king Ahab, yet anxiously prays\nbetween his knees, and sends his servant seven times to look for\nit;[264] not with an intention to discredit the Divine oracle, but under\na conviction of his duty to prevent his faith becoming languid and\ntorpid, by pouring out his prayers before God. Wherefore, although, when\nwe are stupid and insensible to our own miseries, he vigilantly watches\nand guards us, and sometimes affords us unsolicited succour, yet it\nhighly concerns us assiduously to supplicate him, that our heart may be\nalways inflamed with a serious and ardent desire of seeking, loving, and\nworshipping him, while we accustom ourselves in all our necessities to\nresort to him as our sheet anchor. Further, that no desire or wish,\nwhich we should be ashamed for him to know, may enter our minds; when we\nlearn to present our wishes, and so to pour out our whole heart in his\npresence. Next, that we may be prepared to receive his blessings with\ntrue gratitude of soul, and even with grateful acknowledgments; being\nreminded by our praying that they come from his hand. Moreover, that\nwhen we have obtained what we sought, the persuasion that he has\nanswered our requests may excite us to more ardent meditations on his\ngoodness, and produce a more joyful welcome of those things which we\nacknowledge to be the fruits of our prayers. Lastly, that use and\nexperience itself may yield our minds a confirmation of his providence\nin proportion to our imbecility, while we apprehend that he not only\npromises never to forsake us, and freely opens a way of access for our\naddressing him in the very moment of necessity; but that his hand is\nalways extended to assist his people, whom he does not feed with mere\nwords, but supports with present aid. On these accounts our most\nmerciful Father, though liable to no sleep or languor, yet frequently\nappears as if he were sleepy or languid, in order to exercise us, who\nare otherwise slothful and inactive, in approaching, supplicating, and\nearnestly importuning him to our own advantage. It is extremely absurd,\ntherefore, in them who, with a view to divert the minds of men from\npraying to God, pretend that it is useless for us by our interruptions\nto weary the Divine Providence, which is engaged in the conservation of\nall things; whereas the Lord declares, on the contrary, that he “is nigh\nto all that call upon him in truth.”[265] And equally nugatory is the\nobjection of others, that it is superfluous to petition for those things\nwhich the Lord is ready voluntarily to bestow; whereas even those very\nthings, which flow to us from his spontaneous liberality, he wishes us\nto consider as granted to our prayers. This is evinced by that memorable\npassage in the Psalms, as well as by many other correspondent\ntexts,—“The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are\nopen unto their cry;”[266] which celebrates the Divine Providence as\nspontaneously engaged to accomplish the salvation of believers; yet does\nnot omit the exercise of faith, by which sloth is expelled from the\nminds of men. The eyes of God, then, are vigilant to succour the\nnecessity of the blind; but he is likewise willing to hear our groans,\nto give a better proof of his love towards us. And thus it is equally\ntrue, that “he that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps,” and yet\nthat he remains, as it were, forgetful of us, while he beholds us\nslothful and dumb.\nIV. Now, for conducting prayer in a right and proper manner, the first\nrule is, that our heart and mind be composed to a suitable frame,\nbecoming those who enter into conversation with God. This state of mind\nwe shall certainly attain, if, divested of all carnal cares and\nthoughts, that tend to divert and seduce it from a right and clear view\nof God, it not only devotes itself entirely to the solemn exercise, but\nis likewise as far as possible elevated and carried above itself. Nor do\nI here require a mind so disengaged as to be disturbed by no solicitude;\nsince there ought, on the contrary, most anxiously to be kindled within\nus a fervency of prayer, (as we see the holy servants of God discover\ngreat solicitude, and even anguish, when they say they utter their\ncomplaints to the Lord from the deep abysses of affliction and the very\njaws of death.) But I maintain the necessity of dismissing all foreign\nand external cares, by which the wandering mind may be hurried hither\nand thither, and dragged from heaven down to earth. It ought to be\nelevated above itself, that it may not intrude into the Divine presence\nany of the imaginations of our blind and foolish reason, nor confine\nitself within the limits of its own vanity, but rise to purity worthy of\nGod.\nV. Both these things are highly worthy of observation—first, that\nwhoever engages in prayer, should apply all his faculties and attention\nto it, and not be distracted, as is commonly the case, with wandering\nthoughts; nothing being more contrary to a reverence for God than such\nlevity, which indicates a licentious spirit, wholly unrestrained by\nfear. In this case our exertions must be great in proportion to the\ndifficulty we experience. For no man can be so intent on praying, but he\nmay perceive many irregular thoughts intruding on him, and either\ninterrupting, or by some oblique digression retarding, the course of his\ndevotions. But here let us consider what an indignity it is, when God\nadmits us to familiar intercourse with him, to abuse such great\ncondescension by a mixture of things sacred and profane, while our\nthoughts are not confined to him by reverential awe; but as if we were\nconversing with a mean mortal, we quit him in the midst of our prayer,\nand make excursions on every side. We may be assured, therefore, that\nnone are rightly prepared for the exercise of prayer, but those who are\nso affected by the Divine Majesty as to come to it divested of all\nearthly cares and affections. And this is indicated by the ceremony of\nlifting up the hands, that men may remember that they are at a great\ndistance from God, unless they lift up their thoughts on high. As it is\nalso expressed in the psalm, “Unto thee do I lift up my soul.”[267] And\nthe Scripture frequently uses this mode of expression, “to lift up one’s\nprayer;” that they, who desire to be heard by God, may not sink into\nlethargic inactivity. To sum up the whole, the greater the liberality of\nGod towards us, in gently inviting us to disburden ourselves of our\ncares by casting them on him, the less excusable are we, unless his\nsignal and incomparable favour preponderate with us beyond every thing\nelse, and attract us to him in a serious application of all our\nfaculties and attention to the duty of prayer; which cannot be done\nunless our mind by strenuous exertion rise superior to every impediment.\nOur second proposition is, that we must pray for no more than God\npermits. For though he enjoins us to pour out our hearts before\nhim,[268] yet he does not carelessly give the reins to affections of\nfolly and depravity; and when he promises to “fulfil the desire”[269] of\nbelievers, he does not go to such an extreme of indulgence, as to\nsubject himself to their caprice. But offences against both these rules\nare common and great; for most men not only presume, without modesty or\nreverence, to address God concerning their follies, and impudently to\nutter at his tribunal whatever has amused them in their reveries or\ndreams, but so great is their folly or stupidity, that they dare to\nobtrude upon God all their foulest desires, which they would be\nexceedingly ashamed to reveal to men. Some heathens have ridiculed and\neven detested this presumption, but the vice itself has always\nprevailed; and hence it was that the ambitious chose Jupiter as their\npatron; the avaricious, Mercury; the lovers of learning, Apollo and\nMinerva; the warlike, Mars; and the libidinous, Venus; just as in the\npresent age (as I have lately hinted) men indulge a greater license to\ntheir unlawful desires in their prayers, than if they were conversing in\na jocular manner with their equals. God suffers not his indulgence to be\nso mocked, but asserts his power, and subjects our devotions to his\ncommands. Therefore we ought to remember this passage in John: “This is\nthe confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according\nto his will, he heareth us.”[270] But as our abilities are very unequal\nto such great perfection, we must seek some remedy to relieve us. As the\nattention of the mind ought to be fixed on God, so it is necessary that\nit should be followed by the affection of the heart. But they both\nremain far below this elevation; or rather, to speak more consistently\nwith truth, they grow weary and fail in the ascent, or are carried a\ncontrary course. Therefore, to assist this imbecility, God gives us the\nSpirit, to be the director of our prayers, to suggest what is right, and\nto regulate our affections. For “the Spirit helpeth our infirmities; for\nwe know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself\nmaketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered;”[271]\nnot that he really prays or groans; but he excites within us confidence,\ndesires, and sighs, to the conception of which our native powers were\naltogether inadequate. Nor is it without reason that Paul terms those\n“groanings,” which arise from believers under the influence of the\nSpirit, “unutterable;” because they who are truly engaged in prayers,\nare not ignorant that they are so perplexed with dubious anxieties, that\nthey can scarcely decide what it is expedient to utter; and even while\nthey are attempting to lisp, they stammer and hesitate; whence it\nfollows that the ability of praying rightly is a peculiar gift. These\nthings are not said in order that we may indulge our own indolence,\nresigning the office of prayer to the Spirit of God, and growing torpid\nin that negligence to which we are too prone; according to the impious\nerrors of some, that we should wait in indolent supineness till he call\nour minds from other engagements and draw them to himself; but rather\nthat, wearied with our sloth and inactivity, we may implore such\nassistance of the Spirit. Nor does the apostle, when he exhorts us to\n“pray in the Holy Ghost,”[272] encourage us to remit our vigilance;\nsignifying, that the inspiration of the Spirit operates in the formation\nof our prayers, so as not in the least to impede or retard our own\nexertions; since it is the will of God to prove in this instance the\nefficacious influence of faith on our hearts.\nVI. Let this be the second rule: That in our supplications we should\nhave a real and permanent sense of our indigence, and seriously\nconsidering our necessity of all that we ask, should join with the\npetitions themselves a serious and ardent desire of obtaining them. For\nmultitudes carelessly recite a form of prayer, as though they were\ndischarging a task imposed on them by God; and though they confess that\nthis is a remedy necessary for their calamities, since it would be\ncertain destruction to be destitute of the Divine aid which they\nimplore, yet that they perform this duty merely in compliance with\ncustom, is evident from the coldness of their hearts, and their\ninattention to the nature of their petitions. They are led to this by\nsome general and confused sense of their necessity, which nevertheless\ndoes not excite them to implore a relief for their great need as a case\nof present urgency. Now, what can we imagine more odious or execrable to\nGod than this hypocrisy, when any man prays for the pardon of sins, who\nat the same time thinks he is not a sinner, or at least does not think\nthat he is a sinner? which is an open mockery of God himself. But such\ndepravity, as I have before observed, pervades the whole human race,\nthat as a matter of form they frequently implore of God many things\nwhich they either expect to receive from some other source independent\nof his goodness, or imagine themselves already to possess. The crime of\nsome others appears to be smaller, but yet too great to be tolerated;\nwho, having only imbibed this principle, that God must be propitiated by\ndevotions, mutter over their prayers without meditation. But believers\nought to be exceedingly cautious, never to enter into the presence of\nGod to present any petition, without being inflamed with a fervent\naffection of soul, and feeling an ardent desire to obtain it from him.\nMoreover, although in those things which we request only for the Divine\nglory, we do not at the first glance appear to regard our own necessity,\nyet it is incumbent on us to pray for them with equal fervour and\nvehemence of desire. As when we pray that his name may be hallowed, or\nsanctified, we ought (so to speak) ardently to hunger and thirst for\nthat sanctification.\nVII. If any man object, that we are not always urged to pray by the same\nnecessity, this I grant, and this distinction is usefully represented to\nus by James: “Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry?\nlet him sing psalms.”[273] Common sense itself therefore dictates, that\nbecause of our extreme indolence, we are the more vigorously stimulated\nby God to earnestness in prayer according to the exigencies of our\ncondition. And this David calls “a time when God may be found,”[274]\nbecause (as he teaches in many other places) the more severely we are\noppressed by troubles, disasters, fears, and other kinds of temptations,\nwe have the greater liberty of access to God, as though he then\nparticularly invited us to approach him. At the same time, it is equally\ntrue that we ought to be, as Paul says, “praying always,”[275] because,\nhow great soever we may believe the prosperity of our affairs, and\nthough we are surrounded on every side by matter of joy, yet there is no\nmoment of time in which our necessity does not furnish incitements to\nprayer. Does any one abound in wine and corn? Since he cannot enjoy a\nmorsel of bread but by the continual favour of God, his cellars or barns\nafford no objection to his praying for daily bread. Now, if we reflect\nhow many dangers threaten us every moment, fear itself will teach us\nthat there is no time in which prayer is unsuitable to us. Yet this may\nbe discovered still better in spiritual concerns. For when will so many\nsins, of which we are conscious, suffer us to remain in security,\nwithout humbly deprecating both the guilt and the punishment? When will\ntemptations grant us a truce, so that we need not be in haste to obtain\nassistance? Besides, an ardent desire of the Divine kingdom and glory\nought irresistibly to attract us, not by intervals, but without\nintermission, rendering every season equally suitable. It is not in\nvain, therefore, that assiduity in prayer is so frequently enjoined. I\nspeak not yet of perseverance, which shall be mentioned hereafter; but\nthe scriptural admonitions to “pray without ceasing” are so many\nreproofs of our sloth; because we feel not our need of this care and\ndiligence. This rule precludes and banishes from prayer, hypocrisy,\nsubtilty, and falsehood. God promises that he will be near to all who\ncall upon him in truth, and declares he will be found by those who seek\nhim with their whole heart. But to this, persons pleased with their own\nimpurity never aspire. Legitimate prayer, therefore, requires\nrepentance. Whence it is frequently said in the Scriptures, that God\nhears not the wicked, and that their prayers are an abomination; as are\nalso their sacrifices; for it is reasonable, that they who shut up their\nown hearts, should find the ears of God closed against them; and God\nshould be inflexible to them who provoke his rigour by their obduracy.\nIn Isaiah, he threatens thus: “When ye make many prayers, I will not\nhear: your hands are full of blood.”[276] Again in Jeremiah: “I\nprotested, yet they inclined not their ear. Therefore, though they shall\ncry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.”[277] Because he considers\nhimself grossly insulted by the wicked boasting of his covenant, while\nthey are continually dishonouring his sacred name. Wherefore he\ncomplains, in Isaiah, “This people draw near me with their mouth, but\nhave removed their heart far from me.”[278] He does not restrict this\nsolely to prayer; but asserts his abhorrence of hypocrisy in every\nbranch of his worship. Which is the meaning of this passage in James:\n“Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it\nupon your lusts.”[279] It is true, indeed, (as we shall presently again\nsee,) that the prayers of the faithful depend not on their personal\nworthiness; yet this does not supersede the admonition of John:\n“Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his\ncommandments;”[280] because an evil conscience shuts the gate against\nus. Whence it follows, that none pray aright, and that no others are\nheard, but the sincere worshippers of God. Whosoever therefore engages\nin prayer, should be displeased with himself on account of his sins, and\nassume, what he cannot do without repentance, the character and\ndisposition of a beggar.\nVIII. To these must be added a third rule—That whoever presents himself\nbefore God for the purpose of praying to him, must renounce every idea\nof his own glory, reject all opinion of his own merit, and, in a word,\nrelinquish all confidence in himself, giving, by this humiliation of\nhimself, all the glory entirely to God; lest, arrogating any thing,\nthough ever so little, to ourselves, we perish from his presence in\nconsequence of our vanity. Of this submission, which prostrates every\nhigh thought, we have frequent examples in the servants of God; of whom\nthe most eminent for holiness feel the greatest consternation on\nentering into the presence of the Lord. Thus Daniel, whom the Lord\nhimself has so highly commended, said, “We do not present our\nsupplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great\nmercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer\nnot, for thine own sake, O my God; for thy city and thy people are\ncalled by thy name.”[281] Nor does he, as is generally the case,\nconfound himself with the multitude, as one of the people; but makes a\nseparate confession of his own guilt, resorting as a suppliant to the\nasylum of pardon; as he expressly declares, “Whilst I was confessing my\nsin, and the sin of my people.”[282] We are taught the same humility\nalso by the example of David: “Enter not into judgment with thy servant;\nfor in thy sight shall no man living be justified.”[283] In this manner\nIsaiah prays: “Behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in thy ways\nis continuance, and we shall be saved. For we are all as an unclean\nthing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do\nfade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.\nAnd there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself\nto take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast\nconsumed us, because of our iniquities. But now, O Lord, thou art our\nFather; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of\nthy hand. Be not wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for\never; behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.”[284]\nObserve, they have no dependence but this; that considering themselves\nas God’s children, they despair not of his future care of them. Thus\nJeremiah: “Though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy\nname’s sake.”[285] For that is equally consistent with the strictest\ntruth and holiness, which was written by an uncertain author, but is\nascribed to the prophet Baruch: “A soul sorrowful and desolate for the\ngreatness of its sin, bowed down and infirm, a hungry soul and fainting\neyes give glory to thee, O Lord. Not according to the righteousnesses of\nour fathers do we pour out our prayers in thy sight, and ask mercy\nbefore thy face, O Lord, our God; but because thou art merciful, have\nmercy upon us, for we have sinned against thee.”[286]\nIX. Finally, the commencement and even introduction to praying rightly\nis a supplication for pardon with an humble and ingenuous confession of\nguilt. For neither is there any hope that even the holiest of men can\nobtain any blessing of God till he be freely reconciled to him, nor is\nit possible for God to be propitious to any, but those whom he pardons.\nIt is no wonder, then, if believers with this key open to themselves the\ngate of prayer; as we learn from many places in the Psalms. For David,\nwhen requesting another thing, says, “Remember not the sins of my youth,\nnor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy\ngoodness’ sake, O Lord.” Again: “Look upon mine affliction and my pain;\nand forgive all my sins.”[287] Where we likewise perceive, that it is\nnot sufficient for us to call ourselves to a daily account for recent\nsins, unless we remember those which might seem to have been long buried\nin oblivion. For the same Psalmist, in another place,[288] having\nconfessed one grievous crime, takes occasion thence to revert to his\nmother’s womb, where he had contracted his original pollution; not in\norder to extenuate his guilt by the corruption of his nature, but that,\naccumulating all the sins of his life, he may find God the more ready to\nlisten to his prayers in proportion to the severity of his\nself-condemnation. But though the saints do not always in express terms\npray for remission of sins, yet if we diligently examine their prayers\nrecited in the Scriptures, it will easily appear, as I assert, that they\nderived their encouragement to pray from the mere mercy of God, and so\nalways began by deprecating his displeasure; for if every man examine\nhis own conscience, he is so far from presuming familiarly to\ncommunicate his cares to God, that he trembles at every approach to him,\nexcept in a reliance on his mercy and forgiveness. There is also,\nindeed, another special confession, when they wish for an alleviation of\npunishments, which is tacitly praying for the pardon of their sins;\nbecause it were absurd to desire the removal of an effect, while the\ncause remains. For we must beware of imitating foolish patients, who are\nonly solicitous for the cure of the symptoms, but neglect the radical\ncause of the disease. Besides, we should first seek for God to be\npropitious to us, previously to any external testimonies of his favour;\nbecause it is his own will to observe this order, and it would be of\nlittle advantage to us to receive benefits from him, unless a discovery\nto the conscience of his being appeased towards us rendered him\naltogether amiable in our view. Of this we are likewise apprized by the\nreply of Christ; for when he had determined to heal a paralytic person,\nhe said, “Thy sins be forgiven thee;”[289] thereby calling our attention\nto that which ought to be the chief object of desire, that God may\nreceive us into his favour, and then, by affording us assistance,\ndiscover the effect of reconciliation. But beside the special confession\nof present guilt, in which believers implore the pardon of every sin and\nthe remission of every punishment, that general preface, which\nconciliates a favourable attention to our prayers, is never to be\nomitted; because, unless they be founded on God’s free mercy, they will\nall be unavailing. To this topic we may refer that passage of John—“If\nwe confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and\nto cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”[290] Wherefore, under the law,\nprayers are required to be consecrated by an atonement of blood, to\nrender them acceptable, and to remind the people that they were unworthy\nof so great and honourable a privilege, till, purified from their\npollutions, they should derive confidence in prayer from the mere mercy\nof God.\nX. But when the saints sometimes appear to urge their own righteousness\nas an argument in their supplications with God,—as when David says,\n“Preserve my soul; for I am holy;”[291] and Hezekiah, “I beseech thee, O\nLord, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and have done\nthat which is good in thy sight,”[292]—their only design in such modes\nof expression is, from their regeneration to prove themselves to be\nservants and sons of God, to whom he declares he will be propitious. He\ntells us by the Psalmist, (as we have already seen,) that “his eyes are\nupon the righteous, and that his ears are open unto their cry;”[293] and\nagain, by the apostle, that “whatsoever we ask, we receive of him,\nbecause we keep his commandments;”[294] in which passages he does not\ndetermine the value of prayer according to the merit of works; but\nintends by them to establish the confidence of those who are conscious\nto themselves, as all believers ought to be, of unfeigned integrity and\ninnocence. For the observation in John, made by the blind man who\nreceived his sight, that “God heareth not sinners,”[295] is a principle\nof Divine truth, if we understand the word _sinners_, in the common\nacceptation of Scripture, to signify those who are all asleep and\ncontent in their sins, without any desire of righteousness; since no\nheart can ever break out into a sincere invocation of God, unaccompanied\nwith aspirations after piety. To such promises, therefore, correspond\nthose declarations of the saints, in which they introduce the mention of\ntheir own purity or innocence, that they may experience a manifestation\nto themselves of what is to be expected by all the servants of God.\nBesides, they are generally found in the use of this species of prayer,\nwhen before the Lord they compare themselves with their enemies, from\nwhose iniquity they desire him to deliver them. Now, in this comparison,\nwe need not wonder, if they produce their righteousness and simplicity\nof heart, in order to prevail upon him by the justice of their cause to\nyield the more ready assistance. We object not, therefore, to the pious\nheart of a good man making use before the Lord of the consciousness of\nhis own purity for his confirmation in the promises which the Lord has\ngiven for the consolation and support of his true worshippers; but his\nconfidence of success we wish to be independent of every consideration\nof personal merit, and to rest solely on the Divine clemency.\nXI. The fourth and last rule is, That thus prostrate with true humility,\nwe should nevertheless be animated to pray by the certain hope of\nobtaining our requests. It is indeed an apparent contradiction, to\nconnect a certain confidence of God’s favour with a sense of his\nrighteous vengeance; though these two things are perfectly consistent,\nif persons oppressed by their own guilt be encouraged solely by the\nDivine goodness. For as we have before stated, that repentance and\nfaith, of which one terrifies, and the other exhilarates, are\ninseparably connected, so their union is necessary in prayer. And this\nagreement is briefly expressed by David: “I will come (says he) into thy\nhouse in the multitude of thy mercy; and in thy fear will I worship\ntoward thy holy temple.”[296] Under the “goodness of God,” he\ncomprehends faith, though not to the exclusion of fear; for his majesty\nnot only commands our reverence, but our own unworthiness makes us\nforget all pride and security, and fills us with fear. I do not mean a\nconfidence which delivers the mind from all sense of anxiety, and\nsoothes it into pleasant and perfect tranquillity; for such a placid\nsatisfaction belongs to those whose prosperity is equal to their wishes,\nwho are affected by no care, corroded by no desire, and alarmed by no\nfear. And the saints have an excellent stimulus to calling upon God,\nwhen their necessities and perplexities harass and disquiet them, and\nthey are almost despairing in themselves, till faith opportunely\nrelieves them; because, amidst such troubles, the goodness of God is so\nglorious in their view, that though they groan under the pressure of\npresent calamities, and are likewise tormented with the fear of greater\nin future, yet a reliance on it alleviates the difficulty of bearing\nthem, and encourages a hope of deliverance. The prayers of a pious man,\ntherefore, must proceed from both these dispositions, and must also\ncontain and discover them both; though he must groan under present\nevils, and is anxiously afraid of new ones, yet at the same time he must\nresort for refuge to God, not doubting his readiness to extend the\nassistance of his hand. For God is highly incensed by our distrust, if\nwe supplicate him for blessings which we have no expectation of\nreceiving. There is nothing, therefore, more suitable to the nature of\nprayers, than that they be conformed to this rule—not to rush forward\nwith temerity, but to follow the steps of faith. To this principle\nChrist calls the attention of us all in the following passage: “I say\nunto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye\nreceive them, and ye shall have them.”[297] This he confirms also in\nanother place: “Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall\nreceive.”[298] With which James agrees: “If any of you lack wisdom, let\nhim ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\nBut let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.”[299] Where, by opposing\n“faith” to “wavering,” he very aptly expresses its nature. And equally\nworthy of attention is what he adds, that they avail nothing, who call\nupon God in perplexity and doubt, and are uncertain in their minds\nwhether they shall be heard or not; whom he even compares to waves,\nwhich are variously tossed and driven about with the wind. Whence he\nelsewhere calls a legitimate prayer “the prayer of faith.”[300] Besides,\nwhen God so frequently affirms, that he will give to every man according\nto his faith, he implies that we can obtain nothing without faith.\nFinally, it is faith that obtains whatever is granted in answer to\nprayer. This is the meaning of that famous passage of Paul, to which\ninjudicious men pay little attention: “How shall they call on him, in\nwhom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him, of whom\nthey have not heard? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the\nword of God.”[301] For by a regular deduction of prayer originally from\nfaith, he evidently contends, that God cannot be sincerely invoked by\nany, but those to whom his clemency and gentleness have been revealed\nand familiarly discovered by the preaching of the gospel.\nXII. This necessity our adversaries never consider. Therefore, when we\ninculcate on believers a certain confidence of mind that God is\npropitious and benevolent towards them, they consider us as advancing\nthe greatest of all absurdities. But if they were in the habit of true\nprayer, they would certainly understand, that there can be no proper\ninvocation of God without such a strong sense of the Divine benevolence.\nBut since no man can fully discover the power of faith without an\nexperience of it in his heart, what advantage can arise from disputing\nwith such men, who plainly prove that they never had any other than a\nvain imagination? For the value and necessity of that assurance which we\nrequire, is chiefly learned by prayer; and he who does not perceive\nthis, betrays great stupidity of conscience. Leaving, then, this class\nof blinded mortals, let us ever abide by the decision of Paul, that God\ncannot be called upon, but by those who receive from the gospel a\nknowledge of his mercy, and a certain persuasion that it is prepared for\nthem. For what kind of an address would this be? “O Lord, I am truly in\ndoubt, whether thou be willing to hear me; but since I am oppressed with\nanxiety, I flee to thee, that if I be worthy thou mayest assist me.”\nThis does not resemble the solicitude of the saints, whose prayers we\nread in the Scriptures. Nor is it agreeable to the teaching of the Holy\nSpirit by the apostle, who commands us “to come boldly to the throne of\ngrace, that we may find grace;”[302] and informs us, that “we have\nboldness and access, with confidence, by the faith of Christ.”[303] This\nassurance of obtaining what we implore, therefore, which is both\ncommanded by the Lord himself, and taught by the example of the saints,\nit becomes us to hold fast with all our might, if we would pray to any\ngood purpose. For that prayer alone is accepted by God, which arises (if\nI may use the expression) from such a presumption of faith, and is\nfounded on an undaunted assurance of hope. He might, indeed, have\ncontented himself with the simple mention of “faith;” yet he has not\nonly added “confidence,” but furnished that confidence with liberty or\n“boldness” to distinguish by this criterion between us and unbelievers,\nwho do indeed pray to God in common with us, but entirely at an\nuncertainty. For which reason, the whole Church prays in the psalm, “Let\nthy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.”[304] The\nPsalmist elsewhere introduces the same idea: “This I know; for God is\nfor me.”[305] Again: “In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee,\nand will look up.”[306] For from these words we gather, that prayers are\nbut empty sounds, if unattended by hope, from which, as from a\nwatch-tower, we quietly look out for God. With which corresponds the\norder of Paul’s exhortation; for before exhorting believers to “pray\nalways with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,” he first directs\nthem to “take the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the\nsword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.”[307] Now, let the reader\nrecollect, what I have before asserted, that faith is not at all\nweakened by being connected with an acknowledgment of our misery,\npoverty, and impurity. For believers feel themselves oppressed by a\ngrievous load of sins, while destitute of every thing which could\nconciliate the favour of God, and burdened with much guilt, which might\njustly render him an object of their dread; yet they cease not to\npresent themselves before him; nor does this experience terrify them\nfrom resorting to him, since there is no other way of access to him. For\nprayer was instituted, not that we might arrogantly exalt ourselves in\nthe presence of God, or form a high opinion of any thing of our own; but\nthat we might confess our guilt to him, and deplore our miseries with\nthe familiarity of children confiding their complaints to their parents.\nThe immense accumulation of our distresses should operate as so many\nincitements to urge us to pray; as we are taught likewise by the example\nof the Psalmist: “Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.”[308] I\nconfess, indeed, that the operation of such incentives would be fatal,\nwere it not for the Divine aid; but our most benevolent Father, in his\nincomparable mercy, has afforded a timely remedy, that allaying all\nperturbation, alleviating all cares, and dispelling all fears, he might\ngently allure us to himself, and facilitate our approach to him, by the\nremoval of every obstacle and every doubt.\nXIII. And in the first place, when he enjoins us to pray, the\ncommandment itself implies a charge of impious contumacy, if we disobey\nit. No command can be more precise than that in the psalm: “Call upon me\nin the day of trouble.”[309] But as the Scripture recommends no one of\nthe duties of piety more frequently, it is unnecessary to dwell any\nlonger upon it. “Ask, (says our Lord,) and it shall be given you; knock,\nand it shall be opened unto you.”[310] To this precept, however, there\nis also annexed a promise, which is very necessary; for though all men\nacknowledge obedience to be due to a precept, yet the greater part of\nthem would neglect the calls of God, if he did not promise to be\npropitious to them, and even to advance to meet them. These two\npositions being proved, it is evident that all those who turn their\nbacks on God, or do not directly approach him, are not only guilty of\ndisobedience and rebellion, but also convicted of unbelief; because they\ndistrust the promises; which is the more worthy of observation, since\nhypocrites, under the pretext of humility and modesty, treat the command\nof God with such haughty contempt as to give no credit to his kind\ninvitation, and even defraud him of a principal part of his worship. For\nafter having refused sacrifices, in which all holiness then appeared to\nconsist, he declares the principal and most acceptable part of his\nservice to be, “calling upon him in the day of trouble.” Wherefore, when\nhe requires what is due to him, and animates us to a cheerful obedience,\nthere are no pretexts for diffidence or hesitation sufficiently specious\nto excuse us. The numerous texts of Scripture, therefore, which enjoin\nus to call upon God, are as so many banners placed before our eyes to\ninspire us with confidence. It were temerity to rush into the presence\nof God, without a previous invitation from him. He therefore opens a way\nfor us by his own word: “I will say, It is my people; and they shall\nsay, The Lord is my God.”[311] We see how he leads his worshippers, and\ndesires them to follow him; and therefore that there is no reason to\nfear lest the melody, which he dictates, should not be agreeable to him.\nLet us particularly remember this remarkable character of God, by a\nreliance on which we shall easily surmount every obstacle: “O thou that\nhearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.”[312] For what is more\namiable or attractive than for God to bear this character, which assures\nus, that nothing is more agreeable to his nature, than to grant the\nrequests of humble suppliants? Hence the Psalmist concludes that the way\nis open, not to a few only, but to all men; because he addresses all in\nthese words: “Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,\nand thou shalt glorify me.”[313] According to this rule, David, in order\nto obtain his request, pleads the promise that had been given him:\n“Thou, O Lord, hast revealed to thy servant—; therefore hath thy servant\nfound in his heart to pray.”[314] Whence we conclude that he would have\nbeen fearful, had he not been encouraged by the promise. So in another\nplace he furnishes himself with this general doctrine: “He will fulfil\nthe desire of them that fear him.”[315] In the Psalms we may likewise\nobserve the connection of prayer as it were interrupted, and sudden\ntransitions made, sometimes to the power of God, sometimes to his\ngoodness, and sometimes to the truth of his promises. It might appear as\nthough David mutilated his prayers by an unseasonable introduction of\nsuch passages; but believers know by experience, that the ardour of\ndevotion languishes, unless it be supported by fresh supplies; and\ntherefore a meditation on the nature and the word of God is far from\nbeing useless in the midst of our prayers. Let us not hesitate, then, to\nfollow the example of David in the introduction of topics calculated to\nreanimate languid souls with new vigour.\nXIV. And it is wonderful that we are no more affected with promises so\nexceedingly sweet; that the generality of men, wandering through a\nlabyrinth of errors, after having forsaken the fountain of living\nwaters, prefer hewing out for themselves cisterns incapable of\ncontaining any water, to embracing the free offers of Divine goodness.\n“The name of the Lord (says Solomon) is a strong tower: the righteous\nrunneth into it, and is safe.”[316] And Joel, after having predicted the\nspeedy approach of a dreadful destruction, adds this memorable sentence:\n“Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be delivered;”[317]\nwhich we know properly refers to the course of the gospel. Scarcely one\nman in a hundred is induced to advance to meet the Lord. He proclaims by\nIsaiah, “Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet\nspeaking, I will hear.”[318] And in another place he dignifies the whole\nChurch in general with the same honour; as it belongs to all the members\nof Christ: “He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with\nhim in trouble: I will deliver him.”[319] As I have before said,\nhowever, my design is not to enumerate all the texts, but to select the\nmost remarkable, from which we may perceive the condescending kindness\nof God in inviting us to him, and the circumstances of aggravation\nattending our ingratitude, while our indolence still lingers in the\nmidst of such powerful incitements. Wherefore let these words\nperpetually resound in our ears: “The Lord is nigh unto all them that\ncall upon him, to all that call upon him in truth;”[320] as well as\nthose which we have cited from Isaiah and Joel; in which God affirms,\nthat he is inclined to hear prayers, and is delighted, as with a\nsacrifice of a sweet savour, when we cast our cares upon him. We derive\nthis singular benefit from the Divine promises, when our prayers are\nconceived without doubt or trepidation; but in reliance on his word,\nwhose majesty would otherwise terrify us, we venture to call upon him as\nour Father, because he deigns to suggest to us this most delightful\nappellation. Favoured with such invitations, it remains for us to know\nthat they furnish us with sufficient arguments to enforce our petitions;\nsince our prayers rest on no intrinsic merit; but all their worthiness,\nas well as all our hope of obtaining our requests, is founded in, and\ndependent upon, the Divine promises; so that there is no need of any\nother support or further anxiety. Therefore we may be fully assured,\nthat though we equal not the sanctity so celebrated in holy patriarchs,\nprophets, and apostles, yet, since the command to pray is common to us\nas well as to them, and we are partakers of the same common faith, if we\nrely on the Divine word, we are associated with them in this privilege.\nFor God’s declaration, (already noticed,) that he will be gentle and\nmerciful to all, gives all, even the most miserable, a hope of obtaining\nthe objects of their supplications; and therefore we should remark the\ngeneral forms of expression, by which no man, from the greatest to the\nleast, is excluded; only let him possess sincerity of heart,\nself-abhorrence, humility, and faith; and let not our hypocrisy profane\nthe name of God by a pretended invocation of him; our most merciful\nFather will not reject those whom he exhorts to approach him, and even\nurges by every possible mode of solicitation. Hence the argument of\nDavid’s prayer, just recited: “Thou, O Lord, hast revealed to thy\nservant—; therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this\nprayer unto thee. And now, O Lord God, thou art that God, and thy words\nbe true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:” begin\ntherefore and do it.[321] As also in another place: “Let thy kindness be\naccording to thy word unto thy servant.”[322] And all the Israelites\ntogether, whenever they fortify themselves with a recollection of the\ncovenant, sufficiently declare that fear ought to be banished from our\ndevotions, because it is contrary to the Divine injunction; and in this\nrespect they imitated the examples of the patriarchs, particularly of\nJacob, who, after having confessed himself “not worthy of the least of\nall the mercies” he had received from the hand of God, yet declares\nhimself animated to pray for still greater blessings, because God had\npromised to grant them.[323] But whatever be the pretences of\nunbelievers, for not applying to God under the pressure of every\nnecessity, for not seeking him or imploring his aid, they are equally\nchargeable with defrauding him of the honour due to him, as if they had\nfabricated for themselves new gods and idols; for by this conduct, they\ndeny him to be the Author of all their blessings. On the contrary, there\nis nothing more efficacious to deliver believers from every scruple,\nthan this consideration, that no impediment ought to prevent their\nacting according to the command of God, who declares that nothing is\nmore agreeable to him than obedience. These observations tend more fully\nto elucidate what I have advanced before; that a spirit of boldness in\nprayer is perfectly consistent with fear, reverence, and solicitude; and\nthat there is no absurdity in God’s exalting those who are abased. This\nestablishes an excellent agreement between those apparently repugnant\nforms of expression. Both Jeremiah and Daniel use this phrase: “Make\nprayers fall” before God; for so it is in the original.[324] Jeremiah\nalso: “Let our supplication fall before thee.”[325] Again: believers are\nfrequently said to “lift up their prayer.”[326] So says Hezekiah, when\nrequesting the prophet to intercede for him. And David desires that his\nprayer may ascend “as incense.”[327] For though, under a persuasion of\nGod’s fatherly love, they cheerfully commit themselves to his\nfaithfulness, and hesitate not to implore the assistance he freely\npromises, yet they are not impudently elated with careless security, but\nascend upwards by the steps of the promises, yet in such a manner, that\nthey still continue to be suppliant and self-abased.\nXV. Here several questions are started. The Scripture relates that the\nLord has complied with some prayers, which nevertheless did not arise\nfrom a calm or well-regulated heart. Jotham, for a just cause indeed,\nbut from the impulse of rage, resentment, and revenge, devoted the\ninhabitants of Shechem to the destruction which afterwards fell upon\nthem:[328] the Lord, by fulfilling this curse, seems to approve of such\ndisorderly sallies of passion. Samson also was hurried away by similar\nfervour when he said, “O Lord, strengthen me, that I may be avenged of\nthe Philistines.”[329] For though there was some mixture of honest zeal,\nyet it was a violent, and therefore sinful, avidity of revenge which\npredominated. God granted the request. Whence it seems deducible, that\nprayers not conformable to the rules of the Divine word, are\nnevertheless efficacious. I reply, first, that a permanent rule is not\nannulled by particular examples; secondly, that peculiar emotions have\nsometimes been excited in a few individuals, causing a distinction\nbetween them and men in general. For the answer of Christ to his\ndisciples, who inconsiderately wished to emulate the example of Elias,\n“that they knew not what spirit they were of,” is worthy of observation.\nBut we must remark, further, that God is not always pleased with the\nprayers which he grants; but that, as far as examples are concerned,\nthere are undeniable evidences of the Scripture doctrine, that he\nsuccours the miserable, and hears the groans of those who under the\npressure of injustice implore his aid; that he therefore executes his\njudgments, when the complaints of the poor arise to him, though they are\nunworthy of the least favourable attention. For how often, by punishing\nthe cruelty, rapine, violence, lust, and other crimes of the impious, by\nrestraining their audacity and fury, and even subverting their\ntyrannical power, has he manifestly assisted the victims of unrighteous\noppression, though they have been beating the air with supplications to\nan unknown God! And one of the Psalmists clearly teaches that some\nprayers are not ineffectual, which nevertheless do not penetrate into\nheaven by faith.[330] For he collects those prayers which necessity\nnaturally extorts from unbelievers as well as from believers, but to\nwhich the event shows God to be propitious. Does he by such\ncondescension testify that they are acceptable to him? No; he designs to\namplify or illustrate his mercy by this circumstance, that even the\nrequests of unbelievers are not refused; and likewise to stimulate his\ntrue worshippers to greater diligence in prayer, while they see that\neven the lamentations of the profane are not unattended with advantage.\nYet there is no reason why believers should deviate from the rule given\nthem by God, or envy unbelievers, as though they had made some great\nacquisition when they have obtained the object of their wishes. In this\nmanner we have said that the Lord was moved by the hypocritical\npenitence of Ahab, in order to prove by this example how ready he is to\ngrant the prayers of his own elect, when they seek reconciliation with\nhim by true conversion. Therefore in the Psalms he expostulates with the\nJews, because, after having experienced his propitiousness to their\nprayers, they had almost immediately returned to their native\nperverseness.[331] It is evident, also, from the history of the Judges,\nthat whenever they wept, though their tears were hypocritical, yet they\nwere delivered from the hands of their enemies. As the Lord, therefore,\n“maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,”[332]\npromiscuously, so he despises not the lamentations of those whose cause\nis just, and whose afflictions deserve relief. At the same time his\nattention to them is no more connected with salvation, than his\nfurnishing food to the despisers of his goodness. The question relative\nto Abraham and Samuel is attended with more difficulty; the former of\nwhom prayed for the inhabitants of Sodom without any Divine direction,\nand the latter for Saul even contrary to a plain prohibition.[333] The\nsame is the case of Jeremiah, who deprecated the destruction of the\ncity.[334] For though they suffered a repulse, yet it seems harsh to\ndeny them to have been under the influence of faith. But the modest\nreader will, I hope, be satisfied with this solution; that mindful of\nthe general principles by which God enjoins them to be merciful even to\nthe unworthy, they were not entirely destitute of faith, though in a\nparticular instance their opinion may have disappointed them. Augustine\nhas somewhere this judicious observation: “How do the saints pray in\nfaith, when they implore of God that which is contrary to his decrees?\nIt is because they pray according to his will, not that hidden and\nimmutable will, but that with which he inspires them, that he may hear\nthem in a different way, as he wisely discriminates.” This is an\nexcellent remark; because, according to his incomprehensible designs, he\nso regulates the events of things, that the prayers of the saints, which\ncontain a mixture of faith and error, are not in vain. Yet this no more\naffords an example for imitation, than a sufficient plea to excuse the\nsaints themselves, whom I admit to have transgressed the bounds of duty.\nWherefore, when no certain promise can be found, we should present our\nsupplications to God in a conditional way; which is implied in this\npetition of David: “Awake to the judgment that thou hast\ncommanded;”[335] because he suggests that he was directed by a\nparticular revelation to pray for a temporal blessing.\nXVI. It will also be of use to remark, that the things I have delivered\nconcerning the four rules for praying aright, are not required by God\nwith such extreme rigour as to cause the rejection of all prayers, in\nwhich he does not find a perfection of faith or repentance, united with\nardent zeal and well-regulated desires. We have said, that although\nprayer is a familiar intercourse between God and pious men, yet\nreverence and modesty must be preserved, that we may not give a loose to\nall our wishes, nor even in our desires exceed the Divine permission;\nand to prevent the majesty of God being lessened in our view, our minds\nmust be raised to a pure and holy veneration of him. This no man has\never performed with the purity required; for, to say nothing of the\nmultitude, how many complaints of David savour of intemperance of\nspirit! not that he would designedly remonstrate with God, or murmur at\nhis judgments; but he faints in consequence of his infirmity, and finds\nno better consolation than to pour his sorrows into the Divine bosom.\nMoreover, God bears with our lisping, and pardons our ignorance,\nwhenever any inconsiderate expressions escape us; and certainly without\nthis indulgence there could be no freedom of prayer. But though it was\nDavid’s intention to submit himself wholly to the Divine will, and his\npatience in prayer was equal to his desire of obtaining his requests,\nyet we sometimes perceive the appearance and ebullition of turbulent\npassions, very inconsistent with the first rule we have laid down. We\nmay discover, particularly from the conclusion of the thirty-ninth\npsalm, with what vehemence of grief this holy man was hurried away\nbeyond all the bounds of propriety. “O spare me (says he) before I go\nhence, and be no more.”[336] One might be ready to say, that the man,\nbeing in despair, desires nothing but the removal of God’s hand, that he\nmay putrefy in his own iniquities and miseries. He does not intend to\nrush into intemperance of language, or, as is usual with the reprobate,\ndesire God to depart from him; he only complains that he cannot bear the\nDivine wrath. In these temptations, also, the saints often drop\npetitions, not sufficiently conformable to the rule of God’s word, and\nwithout due reflection on what is right and proper. All prayers polluted\nwith these blemishes deserve to be rejected; yet if the saints mourn,\ncorrect themselves, and return to themselves again, God forgives them.\nThus they offend likewise against the second rule; because they\nfrequently have to contend with their own indifference; nor do their\npoverty and misery sufficiently incite them to seriousness of devotion.\nNow, their minds frequently wander, and are almost absorbed in vanity;\nand they also need pardon in this respect, lest languid, or mutilated,\nor interrupted and desultory prayers should meet with a repulse. God has\nnaturally impressed the minds of men with a conviction that prayers\nrequire to be attended with an elevation of heart. Hence the ceremony of\nelevating the hands, as before observed, which has been common in all\nages and nations, and still continues; but where is the person, who,\nwhile lifting up the hands, is not conscious of dulness, because his\nheart cleaves to the earth? As to praying for the remission of sins,\nthough none of the faithful omit this article, yet they who have been\ntruly engaged in prayers, perceive that they scarcely offer the tenth\npart of the sacrifices mentioned by David: “The sacrifices of God are a\nbroken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not\ndespise.”[337] Thus they have always to pray for a twofold forgiveness;\nboth because they are conscious of many transgressions, with which they\nare not so deeply affected as to be sufficiently displeased with\nthemselves, and as they are enabled to advance in repentance and the\nfear of God, humbled with just sorrow for their offences, they deprecate\nthe vengeance of the Judge. But above all, the weakness or imperfection\nof their faith would vitiate the prayers of believers, were it not for\nthe Divine indulgence; but we need not wonder that this defect is\nforgiven by God, who frequently exercises his children with severe\ndiscipline, as if he fully designed to annihilate their faith. It is a\nvery sharp temptation, when believers are constrained to cry, “How long\nwilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?”[338] as though\neven their prayers were so many provocations of Divine wrath. So when\nJeremiah says, “God shutteth out my prayer,”[339] he was undoubtedly\nagitated with severe trouble. Innumerable examples of this kind occur in\nthe Scriptures, from which it appears that the faith of the saints is\noften mingled and agitated with doubts, so that amidst the exercises of\nfaith and hope, they nevertheless betray some remains of unbelief; but\nsince they cannot attain all that is to be wished, it becomes them to be\nincreasingly diligent, in order that, correcting their faults, they may\ndaily make nearer approaches to the perfect rule of prayer, and at the\nsame time to consider into what an abyss of evils they must have been\nplunged, who even in their very remedies contract new diseases; since\nthere is no prayer which God would not justly disdain, if he did not\noverlook the blemishes with which they are all deformed. I mention these\nthings, not that believers may securely forgive themselves any thing\nsinful, but that, by severely correcting themselves, they may strive to\nsurmount these obstacles; and that, notwithstanding the endeavours of\nSatan to obstruct them in all their ways, with a view to prevent them\nfrom praying, they may nevertheless break through all opposition,\ncertainly persuaded, that, though they experience many impediments, yet\nGod is pleased with their efforts, and approves of their prayers,\nprovided they strenuously aim at that which they do not immediately\nattain.\nXVII. But since there is no one of the human race worthy to present\nhimself to God, and to enter into his presence, our heavenly Father\nhimself, to deliver us at once from shame and fear, which might justly\ndepress all our minds, has given us his Son Jesus Christ our Lord to be\nour Advocate and Mediator with him;[340] introduced by whom we may\nboldly approach him, confident, with such an Intercessor, that nothing\nwe ask in his name will be denied us, as nothing can be denied to him by\nhis Father. And to this must be referred all that we have hitherto\nadvanced concerning faith; because, as the promise recommends Christ to\nus as the Mediator, so, unless our hope of success depend on him, it\ndeprives itself of all the benefit of prayer. For as soon as we reflect\non the terrible majesty of God, we cannot but be exceedingly afraid, and\ndriven away from him by a consciousness of our unworthiness, till we\ndiscover Christ as the Mediator, who changes the throne of dreadful\nglory into a throne of grace; as the apostle also exhorts us to “come\nboldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find\ngrace to help in time of need.”[341] And as there is a rule given for\ncalling upon God, as well as a promise that they shall be heard who call\nupon him, so we are particularly enjoined to invoke him in the name of\nChrist; and we have an express promise, that what we ask in his name we\nshall obtain. “Hitherto (says he) ye have asked nothing in my name: ask,\nand ye shall receive. At that day ye shall ask in my name; and\nwhatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may\nbe glorified in the Son.”[342] Hence it is plain beyond all controversy,\nthat they who call upon God in any other name than that of Christ, are\nguilty of a contumacious neglect of his precepts, and a total disregard\nof his will; and that they have no promise of any success. For, as Paul\nsays of Christ, “All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him\namen;” that is, are confirmed and fulfilled.[343]\nXVIII. And we must carefully remark the circumstance of the time when\nChrist commands his disciples to apply to his intercession, which was to\nbe after his ascension to heaven; “At that day (says he) ye shall ask in\nmy name.” It is certain that from the beginning no prayers had been\nheard but for the sake of the Mediator. For this reason the Lord had\nappointed in the law, that the priest alone should enter the sanctuary,\nbearing on his shoulders the names of the tribes of Israel and the same\nnumber of precious stones before his breast; but that the people should\nstand without in the court, and there unite their prayers with those of\nthe priest.[344] The use of the sacrifice was to render their prayers\neffectual. The meaning, therefore, of that shadowy ceremony of the law\nwas, that we are all banished from the presence of God, and therefore\nneed a mediator to appear in our name, to bear us on his shoulders, and\nbind us to his breast, that we may be heard in his person; and,\nmoreover, that the sprinkling of his blood purifies our prayers, which\nhave been asserted to be otherwise never free from defilement. And we\nsee that the saints, when they wished to obtain any thing by prayer,\nfounded their hope on the sacrifices; because they knew them to be the\nconfirmations of all their prayers. David says, “The Lord remember all\nthy offerings, and accept thy burnt-sacrifice.”[345] Hence we conclude,\nthat God has from the beginning been appeased by the intercession of\nChrist, so as to accept the devotions of believers. Why, then, does\nChrist assign a new period, when his disciples shall begin to pray in\nhis name, but because this grace, being now become more illustrious,\ndeserves to be more strongly recommended to us? In this same sense he\nhad just before said, “Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name;\nask.”[346] Not that they were totally unacquainted with the office of\nthe Mediator, (since all the Jews were instructed in these first\nprinciples,) but because they did not yet clearly understand that\nChrist, on his ascension to heaven, would be more evidently the advocate\nof the Church than he was before. Therefore, to console their sorrow for\nhis absence with some signal advantage, he claims the character of an\nadvocate, and teaches them that they have hitherto wanted the principal\nbenefit, which it shall be given them to enjoy, when they shall call\nupon God with greater freedom in a reliance on his intercession; as the\napostle says that this new way is consecrated by his blood.[347] So much\nthe more inexcusable is our perverseness, unless we embrace with the\ngreatest alacrity such an inestimable benefit, which is particularly\ndestined for us.\nXIX. Moreover, since he is the only way of access by which we are\npermitted to approach God, to them who deviate from this road, and\ndesert this entrance, there remains no other way of access to God, nor\nany thing on his throne but wrath, judgment, and terror. Finally, since\nthe Father has appointed him to be our Head and Leader, they who in any\nrespect decline or turn aside from him, endeavour, as far as they can,\nto deface and obliterate a character impressed by God. Thus Christ is\nappointed as the one Mediator, by whose intercession the Father is\nrendered propitious and favourable to us. The saints have likewise their\nintercessions, in which they mutually commend each other’s interests to\nGod, and which are mentioned by the apostle;[348] but these are so far\nfrom detracting any thing from the intercession of Christ, that they are\nentirely dependent on it. For as they arise from the affection of love,\nreciprocally felt by us towards each other as members of one body, so\nlikewise they are referred to the unity of the Head. Being made also in\nthe name of Christ, what are they but a declaration, that no man can be\nbenefited by any prayers at all, independently of Christ’s intercession?\nAnd as the intercession of Christ is no objection to our mutually\npleading for each other, in our prayers in the Church, so let it be\nconsidered as a certain maxim, that all the intercessions of the whole\nChurch should be directed to that principal one. We ought to beware of\ningratitude particularly on this head, because God, pardoning our\nunworthiness, not only permits us to pray each one for himself, but even\nadmits us as intercessors for one another. For, when those who richly\ndeserve to be rejected, if they should privately pray each for himself,\nare appointed by God as advocates of his Church, what pride would it\nbetray to abuse this liberality to obscure the honour of Christ!\nXX. Now, the cavil of the sophists is quite frivolous, that Christ is\nthe Mediator of redemption, but believers of intercession; as if Christ,\nafter performing a temporary mediation, had left to his servants that\nwhich is eternal and shall never die. They who detract so diminutive a\nportion of honour from him, treat him, doubtless, very favourably. But\nthe Scripture, with the simplicity of which a pious man, forsaking these\nimpostors, ought to be contented, speaks very differently; for when John\nsays, “If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus\nChrist,”[349] does he only mean that he has been heretofore an Advocate\nfor us, or does he not rather ascribe to him a perpetual intercession?\nWhat is intended by the assertion of Paul, that he “is even at the right\nhand of God, and also maketh intercession for us?”[350] And when he\nelsewhere calls him the “one Mediator between God and man,” does he not\nrefer to prayers, which he has mentioned just before?“[351] For having\nfirst asserted that intercessions should be made for all men, he\nimmediately adds, in confirmation of that idea, that all have one God\nand one Mediator. Consistent with which is the explanation of Augustine,\nwhen he thus expresses himself: “Christian men in their prayers mutually\nrecommend each other to the Divine regard. That person, for whom no one\nintercedes, while he intercedes for all, is the true and only Mediator.\nThe apostle Paul, though a principal member under the Head, yet because\nhe was a member of the body of Christ, and knew the great and true High\nPriest of the Church had entered, not typically, into the recesses\nwithin the veil, the holy of holies, but truly and really into the\ninterior recesses of heaven, into a sanctuary not emblematical, but\neternal,—Paul, I say, recommends himself to the prayers of believers.\nNeither does he make himself a mediator between God and the people, but\nexhorts all the members of the body of Christ mutually to pray for one\nanother; since the members have a mutual solicitude for each other; and\nif one member suffers, the rest sympathize with it. And so should the\nmutual prayers of all the members, who are still engaged in the labours\nof the present state, ascend on each other’s behalf to the Head, who is\ngone before them into heaven, and who is the propitiation for our sins.\nFor if Paul were a mediator, the other apostles would likewise sustain\nthe same character; and so there would be many mediators; and Paul’s\nargument could not be supported, when he says, ‘For there is one God,\nand one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; in whom we\nalso are one, if we keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.’”\nAgain, in another place: “But if you seek a priest, he is above the\nheavens, where he now intercedes for you, who died for you on earth.”\nYet we do not dream that he intercedes for us in suppliant prostration\nat the Father’s feet; but we apprehend, with the apostle, that he\nappears in the presence of God for us in such a manner, that the virtue\nof his death avails as a perpetual intercession for us; yet so as that,\nbeing entered into the heavenly sanctuary, he continually, till the\nconsummation of all things, presents to God the prayers of his people,\nwho remain, as it were, at a distance in the court.\nXXI. With respect to the saints who are dead in the flesh, but live in\nChrist, if we attribute any intercession to them, let us not imagine\nthat they have any other way of praying to God than by Christ, who is\nthe only way, or that their prayers are accepted by God in any other\nname. Therefore, since the Scripture calls us away from all others to\nChrist alone,—since it is the will of our heavenly Father to gather\ntogether all things in him,—it would be a proof of great stupidity, not\nto say insanity, to be so desirous of procuring an admission by the\nsaints, as to be seduced from him, without whom they have no access\nthemselves. But that this has been practised in some ages, and is now\npractised wherever Popery prevails, who can deny? Their merits are\nfrequently obtruded to conciliate the Divine favour; and in general\nChrist is totally neglected, and God is addressed through their names.\nIs not this transferring to them that office of exclusive intercession,\nwhich we have before asserted to be peculiar to Christ? Again, who,\neither angel or demon, ever uttered to any of the human race a syllable\nconcerning such an intercession as they pretend? for the Scripture is\nperfectly silent respecting any such thing. What reason, then, was there\nfor its invention? Certainly, when the human mind thus seeks assistances\nfor itself, in which it is not warranted by the word of God, it\nevidently betrays its want of faith. Now, if we appeal to the\nconsciences of all the advocates for the intercession of saints, we\nshall find that the only cause of it is, an anxiety in their minds, as\nif Christ could fail of success, or be too severe in this business. By\nwhich perplexity they, in the first place, dishonour Christ, and rob him\nof the character of the only Mediator, which, as it has been given by\nthe Father as his peculiar prerogative, ought therefore not to be\ntransferred to any other. And by this very conduct they obscure the\nglory of his nativity, and frustrate the benefit of his cross; in a\nword, they divest and defraud him of the praise which is due to him for\nall his actions and all his sufferings; since the end of them all is,\nthat he may really be, and be accounted, the sole Mediator. They at the\nsame time reject the goodness of God, who exhibits himself as their\nFather; for he is not a father to them, unless they acknowledge Christ\nas their brother. Which they plainly deny, unless they believe\nthemselves to be the objects of his fraternal affection, than which\nnothing can be more mild or tender. Wherefore the Scripture offers him\nalone to us, sends us to him, and fixes us in him. “He,” says Ambrose,\n“is our mouth, with which we address the Father; our eye, by which we\nbehold the Father; our right hand, by which we present ourselves to the\nFather. Without whose mediation, neither we, nor any of all the saints,\nhave the least intercourse with God.” If they reply, that the public\nprayers in the churches are finished by this conclusion, “through Christ\nour Lord,” it is a frivolous subterfuge; because the intercession of\nChrist is not less profaned when it is confounded with the prayers and\nmerits of the dead, than if it were wholly omitted, and the dead alone\nmentioned. Besides, in all their litanies, both verse and prose, where\nevery honour is ascribed to dead saints, there is no mention of Christ.\nXXII. But their folly rises to such a pitch, that we have here a\nstriking view of the genius of superstition, which, when it has once\nshaken off the reins, places in general no limits to its excursions. For\nafter men had begun to regard the intercession of saints, they by\ndegrees gave to each his particular attributes, so that sometimes one,\nsometimes another, might be invoked as intercessor, according to the\ndifference of the cases; then they chose each his particular saint, to\nwhose protection they committed themselves as to the care of tutelary\ngods. Thus they not only set up (as the prophet anciently accused\nIsrael) gods according to the number of their cities,[352] but even\naccording to the multitude of persons. But, since the saints refer all\ntheir desires solely to the will of God, and observe it, and acquiesce\nin it, he must entertain foolish and carnal, and even degrading thoughts\nof them, who ascribes to them any other prayer, than that in which they\npray for the advent of the kingdom of God; very remote from which is\nwhat they pretend concerning them—that every one of them is disposed by\na private affection more particularly to regard his own worshippers. At\nlength multitudes fell even into horrid sacrilege, by invoking them, not\nas subordinate promoters, but as principal agents, in their salvation.\nSee how low wretched mortals fall, when they wander from their lawful\nstation, the word of God. I omit the grosser monstrosities of impiety,\nfor which, though they render them detestable to God, angels, and men,\nthey do not yet feel either shame or grief. Prostrate before the statue\nor picture of Barbara, Catharine, and others, they mutter _Pater\nNoster_, “Our Father.” This madness the pastors are so far from\nendeavouring to remedy or to restrain, that, allured by the charms of\nlucre, they approve and applaud it. But though they attempt to remove\nfrom themselves the odium of so foul a crime, yet what plea will they\nurge in defence of this, that Eligius and Medardus are supplicated to\nlook down from heaven on their servants, and to assist them? and the\nholy Virgin to command her Son to grant their petitions? It was\nanciently forbidden at the Council of Carthage, that at the altar any\nprayers should be made directly to the saints; and it is probable that,\nwhen those holy men could not wholly subdue the force of depraved\ncustom, they imposed this restraint, that the public prayers might not\nbe deformed by this phrase, “Saint Peter, pray for us.” But to how much\ngreater lengths of diabolical absurdity have they proceeded, who\nhesitate not to transfer to dead men what exclusively belongs to God and\nChrist!\nXXIII. But when they attempt to make this intercession appear to be\nfounded on the authority of Scripture, they labour in vain. We\nfrequently read, they say, of the prayers of angels; and not only so,\nbut the prayers of believers are said to be carried by their hands into\nthe presence of God. But if they would compare saints deceased to\nangels, they ought to prove that they are the ministering spirits who\nare delegated to superintend the concerns of our salvation, whose\nprovince it is to keep us in all our ways, who surround us, who advise\nand comfort us, who watch over us; all of which offices are committed to\nangels, but not to departed saints.[353] How preposterously they include\ndead saints with angels, fully appears from so many different functions,\nby which the Scripture distinguishes some from others. No man will\npresume, without previous permission, to act the part of an advocate\nbefore an earthly judge: whence, then, have worms so great a license to\nobtrude on God as intercessors those who are not recorded to have been\nappointed to that office? God has been pleased to appoint the angels to\nattend to our salvation, whence they frequent the sacred assemblies, and\nthe Church is to them a theatre, in which they admire the various and\n“manifold wisdom of God.”[354] Those who transfer to others that which\nis peculiar to them, certainly confound and pervert the order\nestablished by God, which ought to be inviolable. With equal dexterity\nthey proceed to cite other testimonies. God said to Jeremiah, “Though\nMoses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this\npeople.”[355] How, they say, could he thus have spoken concerning\npersons deceased, unless he knew that they were accustomed to intercede\nfor the living? But I, on the contrary, deduce this conclusion—That\nsince it appears that neither Moses nor Samuel interceded for the\nIsraelites, there was then no intercession of the dead. For who of the\nsaints must we believe to be concerned for the salvation of the people,\nwhen this ceases to be the case with Moses, who far surpassed all others\nin this respect while alive? But if they pursue such minute subtleties,\nthat the dead intercede for the living, because the Lord has said,\n“Though they interceded,” I shall argue, with far greater plausibility,\nin this manner—In the people’s extreme necessity, no intercession was\nmade by Moses, of whom it is said, Though he interceded. Therefore it is\nhighly probable, that no intercession is made by any other, since they\nare all so far from possessing the gentleness, kindness, and paternal\nsolicitude of Moses. This is indeed the consequence of their cavilling,\nthat they are wounded with the same weapons with which they thought\nthemselves admirably defended. But it is very ridiculous, that a plain\nsentence should be so distorted; only because the Lord declares that he\nwill not spare the crimes of the people, even though their cause had\nbeen pleaded by Moses or Samuel, to whose prayers he had shown himself\nso very propitious. This idea is very clearly deduced from a similar\npassage of Ezekiel—“Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were\nin the land, they should deliver but their own souls by their\nrighteousness, saith the Lord God;”[356] where he undoubtedly meant to\nsignify, if two of them should return to life again; for the third was\nthen alive, namely, Daniel, who is well known to have given an\nincomparable specimen of his piety, even in the flower of his youth. Let\nus then leave them, whom the Scripture clearly shows to have finished\ntheir course. Therefore Paul, when speaking of David, does not say that\nhe assists posterity by his prayers, but only that “he served his own\ngeneration.”[357]\nXXIV. They further object—Shall we then divest them of every benevolent\nwish, who through the whole course of their lives breathed only\nbenevolence and mercy? Truly, as I do not wish too curiously to inquire\ninto their actions or thoughts, so it is by no means probable that they\nare agitated by the impulse of particular wishes, but rather that with\nfixed and permanent desires they aspire after the kingdom of God; which\nconsists no less in the perdition of the impious, than in the salvation\nof believers. If this be true, their charity also is comprehended within\nthe communion of the body of Christ, and extends no further than the\nnature of that communion permits. But though I grant that in this\nrespect they pray for us, yet they do not therefore relinquish their own\nrepose, to be distracted with earthly cares; and much less are they\ntherefore to be the objects of our invocation. Neither is it a necessary\nconsequence of this, that they must imitate the conduct of men on earth\nby mutually praying for one another. For this conduces to the\ncultivation of charity among them, while they divide, as it were,\nbetween them, and reciprocally bear their mutual necessities. And in\nthis, indeed, they act according to God’s precept, and are not destitute\nof his promise; which two are always the principal points in prayer. No\nsuch considerations have any relation to the dead; whom when the Lord\nhas removed from our society, he has left us no intercourse with them,\nnor them, indeed, as far as our conjectures can reach, any with us.[358]\nBut if any one plead, that they cannot but retain the same charity\ntowards us, as they are united with us by the same faith, yet who has\nrevealed that they have ears long enough to reach our voices, and eyes\nso perspicacious as to watch over our necessities? They talk in the\nschools of I know not what refulgence of the Divine countenance\nirradiating them, in which, as in a mirror, they behold from heaven the\naffairs of men. But to affirm this, especially with the presumption with\nwhich they dare to assert it, what is it but an attempt, by the\ninfatuated dreams of our own brains, forcibly to penetrate into the\nsecret appointments of God, without the authority of his word, and to\ntrample the Scripture under our feet? which so frequently pronounces our\ncarnal wisdom to be hostile to the wisdom of God; totally condemns the\nvanity of our mind; and directs all our reason to be laid in the dust,\nand the Divine will to be the sole object of our regard.\nXXV. The other testimonies of Scripture which they adduce in defence of\nthis false doctrine, they distort with the greatest perverseness. But\nJacob (they say) prays that his own name, and the name of his fathers,\nAbraham and Isaac, might be named on his posterity.[359] Let us first\ninquire the form of this naming, or calling on their names, among the\nIsraelites; for they do not invoke their fathers to assist them; but\nthey beseech God to remember his servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\nTheir example, therefore, is no vindication of those who address the\nsaints themselves. But as these stupid mortals understand neither what\nit is to name the name of Jacob, nor for what reason it should be named,\nwe need not wonder that they so childishly err even in the form itself.\nThis phraseology more than once occurs in the Scriptures. For Isaiah\nsays, that the name of the husband is “called upon” the wife who lives\nunder his care and protection. The naming or calling, therefore, of the\nname of Abraham upon the Israelites, consists in their deducing their\ngenealogy from him, and revering and celebrating his memory as their\ngreat progenitor. Neither is Jacob actuated by a solicitude for\nperpetuating the celebrity of his name, but by a knowledge that all the\nhappiness of his posterity consisted in the inheritance of that covenant\nwhich God had made with him: and perceiving that this would be the\ngreatest of all blessings to them, he prays that they may be numbered\namong his children; which is only transmitting to them the succession of\nthe covenant. They, on their part, when they introduce the mention of\nthis in their prayers, do not recur to the intercessions of the dead,\nbut put the Lord in remembrance of his covenant, in which their most\nmerciful Father has engaged to be propitious and beneficent to them, for\nthe sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. How little the saints depended in\nany other sense on the merits of their fathers, is evinced by the public\nvoice of the Church in the prophet: “Thou art our Father, though Abraham\nbe ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O Lord, art our\nFather, our Redeemer.”[360] And when they thus express themselves, they\nadd at the same time, “O Lord, return, for thy servants’ sake;” yet not\nentertaining a thought of any intercession, but adverting to the\nblessing of the covenant. But now, since we have the Lord Jesus, in\nwhose hand the eternal covenant of mercy is not only made but confirmed\nto us,—whose name should we rather plead in our prayers? And since these\ngood doctors contend that the patriarchs are in these words represented\nas intercessors, I wish to be informed by them, why, in such a vast\nmultitude, no place, not even the lowest among them, is allotted to\nAbraham, the father of the Church? From what vile source they derive\ntheir advocates, is well known. Let them answer me by proving it right,\nthat Abraham, whom God has preferred to all others, and elevated to the\nhighest degree of honour, should be neglected and suppressed. The truth\nis, that since this practice was unknown in the ancient Church, they\nthought proper, in order to conceal its novelty, to be silent respecting\nthe ancient fathers; as though the difference of names were a valid\nexcuse for a recent and corrupt custom. But the objection urged by some,\nthat God is entreated to have mercy on the people for the sake of David,\nis so far from supporting their error, that it is a decisive refutation\nof it. For if we consider the character sustained by David, he is\nselected from the whole company of the saints, that God may fulfil the\ncovenant which he made with him; so that it refers to the covenant,\nrather than to the person, and contains a figurative declaration of the\nsole intercession of Christ. For it is certain that what was peculiar to\nDavid, as being a type of Christ, is inapplicable to any others.\nXXVI. But it seems that some are influenced by the frequent declarations\nwhich we read, that the prayers of the saints are heard. Why? Truly\nbecause they have prayed. “They cried unto thee,” says the Psalmist,\n“and were delivered; they trusted in thee, and were not\nconfounded.”[361] Therefore, let us likewise pray after their example,\nthat we may obtain a similar audience. But these men preposterously\nargue, that none will be heard but such as have been once already heard.\nHow much more properly does James say, “Elias was a man subject to like\npassions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain; and\nit rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.\nAnd he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought\nforth her fruit.”[362] What! does he infer any peculiar privilege of\nElias, to which we should have recourse? Not at all; but he shows the\nperpetual efficacy of pure and pious prayer, to exhort us to pray in a\nsimilar manner. For we put a mean construction on the promptitude and\nbenignity of God in hearing them, unless we be encouraged by such\ninstances to a firmer reliance on his promises; in which he promises to\nhear, not one or two, or even a few, but all who call upon his name. And\nthis ignorance is so much the less excusable, because they appear almost\nprofessedly to disregard so many testimonies of Scripture. David\nexperienced frequent deliverances by the Divine power; was it that he\nmight arrogate it to himself, in order to deliver us by his\ninterposition? He makes some very different declarations: “The righteous\nshall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.”[363]\nAgain: “They looked unto him, and were lightened; and their faces were\nnot ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him\nout of all his troubles.”[364] The Psalms contain many such prayers, in\nwhich he implores God to grant his requests from this consideration,\nthat the righteous may not be put to shame, but may be encouraged by his\nexample to entertain a good hope. Let us be contented at present with\none instance: “For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in\na time when thou mayest be found;”[365] a text which I have the more\nreadily cited, because the hireling and cavilling advocates of Popery\nhave not been ashamed to plead it to prove the intercession of the dead.\nAs though David had any other design than to show the effect which would\nproceed from the Divine clemency and goodness when his prayers should be\nheard. And in general it must be maintained, that an experience of the\ngrace of God, both to ourselves and to others, affords no small\nassistance to confirm our faith in his promises. I do not recite\nnumerous passages, where he proposes to himself the past blessings of\nGod as a ground of present and future confidence, since they will\nnaturally occur to those who peruse the Psalms. Jacob by his example had\nlong before taught the same lesson: “I am not worthy of the least of all\nthe mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy\nservant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am\nbecome two bands.”[366] He mentions the promise indeed, but not alone;\nhe likewise adds the effect, that he may in future confide with the\ngreater boldness in the continuance of the Divine goodness towards him.\nFor God is not like mortals, who grow weary of their liberality, or\nwhose wealth is exhausted; but is to be estimated by his own nature, as\nis judiciously done by David, when he says, “Thou hast redeemed me, O\nLord God of truth.”[367] After ascribing to him the praise of his\nsalvation, he adds, that he is a God of truth; because, unless he were\nperpetually and uniformly consistent with himself, there could not be\nderived from his benefits a sufficient argument for confiding in him,\nand praying to him. But when we know that every act of assistance, which\nhe affords us, is a specimen and proof of his goodness and faithfulness,\nwe shall have no reason to fear lest our hopes be confounded or our\nexpectations disappointed.\nXXVII. Let us conclude this argument in the following manner: Since the\nScripture represents the principal part of Divine worship to be an\ninvocation of God, as he, in preference to all sacrifices, requires of\nus this duty of piety, no prayer can without evident sacrilege be\ndirected to any other. Wherefore also the Psalmist says, “If we have\nstretched out our hands to a strange god, shall not God search this\nout?”[368] Besides, since God will only be invoked in faith, and\nexpressly commands prayers to be conformed to the rule of his word;\nfinally, since faith founded on the word is the source of true\nprayer,—as soon as the least deviation is made from the word, there must\nnecessarily be an immediate corruption of prayer. But it has been\nalready shown, that if the whole Scripture be consulted, this honour is\nthere claimed for God alone. With respect to the office of intercession,\nwe have also seen, that it is peculiar to Christ, and that no prayer is\nacceptable to God, unless it be sanctified by this Mediator. And though\nbelievers mutually pray to God for their brethren, we have proved that\nthis derogates nothing from the sole intercession of Christ; because\nthey all commend both themselves and others to God in a reliance upon\nit. Moreover we have argued, that this is injudiciously applied to the\ndead, of whom we nowhere read that they are commanded to pray for us.\nThe Scripture frequently exhorts us to the mutual performance of this\nduty for each other; but concerning the dead there is not even a\nsyllable; and James, by connecting these two things, “Confess your\nfaults one to another, and pray one for another,” tacitly excludes the\ndead.[369] Wherefore, to condemn this error, this one reason is\nsufficient, that right prayer originates in faith, and that faith is\nproduced by hearing the word of God, where there is no mention of this\nfictitious intercession; for the temerity of superstition has chosen\nitself advocates, who were not of Divine appointment. For whilst the\nScripture abounds with many forms of prayer, there is not to be found an\nexample of this advocacy, without which the Papists believe there can be\nno prayer at all. Besides, it is evident that this superstition has\narisen from a want of faith, because they either were not content with\nChrist as their intercessor, or entirely denied him this glory. The\nlatter of these is easily proved from their impudence; for they adduce\nno argument more valid to show that we need the mediation of the saints,\nthan when they object that we are unworthy of familiar access to God.\nWhich indeed we acknowledge to be strictly true; but we thence conclude,\nthat they rob Christ of every thing, who consider his intercession as\nunavailing without the assistance of George and Hippolytus, and other\nsuch phantasms.\nXXVIII. But though prayer is properly restricted to wishes and\npetitions, yet there is so great an affinity between petition and\nthanksgiving, that they may be justly comprehended under the same name.\nFor the species which Paul enumerates, fall under the first member of\nthis division. In requests and petitions we pour out our desires before\nGod, imploring those things which tend to the propagation of his glory\nand the illustration of his name, as well as those benefits which\nconduce to our advantage. In thanksgiving we celebrate his beneficence\ntowards us with due praises, acknowledging all the blessings we have\nreceived as the gifts of his liberality. Therefore David has connected\nthese two parts together: “Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will\ndeliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.”[370] The Scripture, not\nwithout reason, enjoins us the continual use of both; for we have\nelsewhere said that our want is so great, and experience itself\nproclaims that we are molested and oppressed on every side with such\nnumerous and great perplexities, that we all have sufficient cause for\nunceasing sighs, and groans, and ardent supplications to God. For though\nthey enjoy a freedom from adversity, yet the guilt of their sins, and\nthe innumerable assaults of temptation, ought to stimulate even the most\neminent saints to pray for relief. But of the sacrifice of praise and\nthanksgiving there can be no interruption, without guilt; since God\nceases not to accumulate on us his various benefits, according to our\nrespective cases, in order to constrain us, inactive and sluggish as we\nare, to the exercise of gratitude. Finally, we are almost overwhelmed\nwith such great and copious effusions of his beneficence; we are\nsurrounded, whithersoever we turn our eyes, by such numerous and amazing\nmiracles of his hand, that we never want matter of praise and\nthanksgiving. And to be a little more explicit on this point, since all\nour hopes and all our help are in God, (which has already been\nsufficiently proved,) so that we cannot enjoy prosperity, either in our\npersons or in any of our affairs, without his benediction,—it becomes us\nassiduously to commend to him ourselves and all our concerns. Further,\nwhatever we think, speak, or act, let all our thoughts, words, and\nactions be under his direction, subject to his will, and finally in hope\nof his assistance. For the curse of God is denounced on all, who\ndeliberate and decide on any enterprise in a reliance on themselves or\non any other, who engage in or attempt to begin any undertaking\nindependently of his will, and without invoking his aid. And since it\nhas already been several times observed, that he is justly honoured when\nhe is acknowledged to be the Author of all blessings, it thence follows\nthat they should all be so received from his hand, as to be attended\nwith unceasing thanksgiving; and that there is no other proper method of\nusing the benefits which flow to us from his goodness, but by continual\nacknowledgments of his praise, and unceasing expressions of our\ngratitude. For Paul, when he declares that they are “sanctified by the\nword of God and prayer,” at the same time implies, that they are not at\nall holy and pure to us without the word and prayer;[371] the word being\nmetonymically used to denote faith. Wherefore David, after experiencing\nthe goodness of the Lord, beautifully declares, “He hath put a new song\nin my mouth;”[372] in which he certainly implies that we are guilty of a\ncriminal silence, if we omit to praise him for any benefit; since, in\nevery blessing he bestows on us, he gives us additional cause to bless\nhis name. Thus also Isaiah, proclaiming the unparalleled grace of God,\nexhorts believers to a new and uncommon song.[373] In which sense David\nelsewhere says, “O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall show\nforth thy praise.”[374] Hezekiah likewise, and Jonah, declare that the\nend of their deliverance shall be to sing the Divine goodness in the\ntemple.[375] David prescribes the same general rule for all the saints.\n“What shall I render (says he) unto the Lord for all his benefits\ntowards me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of\nthe Lord.”[376] And this is followed by the Church in another psalm:\n“Save us, O Lord our God, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to\ntriumph in thy praise.”[377] Again: “He will regard the prayer of the\ndestitute, and not despise their prayer. This shall be written for the\ngeneration to come; and the people which shall be created shall praise\nthe Lord. To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in\nJerusalem.”[378] Moreover, whenever believers entreat the Lord to do any\nthing “for his name’s sake,” as they profess themselves unworthy to\nobtain any blessing on their own account, so they lay themselves under\nan obligation to thanksgiving; and promise that the Divine beneficence\nshall be productive of this proper effect on them, even to cause them to\ncelebrate its fame. Thus Hosea, speaking of the future redemption of the\nChurch, addresses the Lord: “Take away all iniquity, and receive us\ngraciously; so will we render the calves of our lips.”[379] Nor do the\nDivine blessings only claim the praises of the tongue, but naturally\nconciliate our love. “I love the Lord (says David) because he hath heard\nmy voice and my supplications.”[380] In another place also, enumerating\nthe assistances he had experienced, “I will love thee, O Lord, my\nstrength.”[381] Nor will any praises ever please God, but such as flow\nfrom this ardour of love. We must likewise remember the position of\nPaul, that all petitions, to which thanksgiving is not annexed, are\nirregular and faulty. For thus he speaks: “In every thing by prayer and\nsupplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto\nGod.”[382] For since moroseness, weariness, impatience, pungent sorrow\nand fear, impel many to mutter petitions, he enjoins such a regulation\nof the affections, that believers may cheerfully bless God, even before\nthey have obtained their requests. If this connection ought to exist in\ncircumstances apparently adverse, God lays us under a still more sacred\nobligation to sing his praises, whenever he grants us the enjoyment of\nour wishes. But as we have asserted that our prayers, which had\notherwise been defiled, are consecrated by the intercession of Christ,\nso the apostle, when he exhorts us “by Christ to offer the sacrifice of\npraise,”[383] admonishes us that our lips are not sufficiently pure to\ncelebrate the name of God, without the intervention of the priesthood of\nChrist. Whence we infer, how prodigious must be the fascination of the\nPapists, the majority of whom wonder that Christ is called an Advocate.\nThis is the reason why Paul directs to “pray without ceasing,” and “in\nevery thing to give thanks;”[384] because he desires that all men, with\nall possible assiduity, at every time and in every place, and in all\ncircumstances and affairs, may direct their prayers to God, expecting\nall from him, and ascribing to him the praise of all, since he affords\nus perpetual matter of prayer and praise.\nXXIX. But this diligence in prayer, although it chiefly respects the\nparticular and private devotions of each individual, has,\nnotwithstanding, some reference also to the public prayers of the\nChurch. But these cannot be unceasing, nor ought they to be conducted\notherwise than according to the polity which is appointed by the common\nconsent. This, indeed, I confess. For therefore also certain hours are\nfixed and prescribed, though indifferent with God, yet necessary to the\ncustoms of men, that the benefit of all may be regarded, and all the\naffairs of the Church be administered, according to the direction of\nPaul, “decently and in order.”[385] But this by no means prevents it\nfrom being the duty of every Church often to stimulate themselves to a\ngreater frequency of prayer, and also to be inflamed with more ardent\ndevotion on the pressure of any necessity unusually great. But the place\nto speak of perseverance, which is nearly allied to unceasing diligence,\nwill be towards the end. Moreover these things afford no encouragement\nto those vain repetitions which Christ has chosen to interdict us;[386]\nfor he does not forbid us to pray long or frequently, or with great\nfervour of affection; but he forbids us to confide in our ability to\nextort any thing from God by stunning his ears with garrulous loquacity,\nas though he were to be influenced by the arts of human persuasion. For\nwe know that hypocrites, who do not consider that they are concerned\nwith God, are as pompous in their prayers as in a triumph. For that\nPharisee, who thanked God that he was not like other men,[387]\nundoubtedly flattered himself in the eyes of men, as if he wished to\ngain by his prayer the reputation of sanctity. Hence that βαττολογια\n(_vain repetition_) which from a similar cause at present prevails among\nthe Papists; while some vainly consume the time by reiterating the same\noraisons, and others recommend themselves among the vulgar by a tedious\naccumulation of words. Since this garrulity is a puerile mocking of God,\nwe need not wonder that it is prohibited in the Church, that nothing may\nbe heard there but what is serious, and proceeds from the very heart.\nVery similar to this corrupt practice is another, which Christ condemns\nat the same time; that hypocrites, for the sake of ostentation, seek\nafter many witnesses of their devotions, and rather pray in the\nmarket-place, than that their prayers should want the applause of the\nworld. But as it has been already observed that the end of prayer is to\nelevate our minds towards God, both in a confession of his praise and in\na supplication of his aid, we may learn from this that its principal\nplace is in the mind and heart; or, rather, that prayer itself is the\ndesire of the inmost heart, which is poured out and laid before God the\nsearcher of hearts. Wherefore our heavenly Teacher, as has already been\nmentioned, when he intended to deliver the best rule respecting prayer,\ngave the following command: “Enter into thy closet, and when thou hast\nshut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father\nwhich seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.”[388] For when he has\ndissuaded from imitating the example of hypocrites, who endeavoured by\nthe ambitious ostentation of their prayers to gain the favour of men, he\nimmediately adds a better direction, which is, to enter into our closet,\nand there to pray with the door shut. In which words, as I understand\nthem, he has taught us to seek retirement, that we may be enabled to\ndescend into our own hearts, with all our powers of reflection, and\npromised us that God, whose temples our bodies ought to be, will accede\nto the desires of our souls. For he did not intend to deny the\nexpediency of praying also in other places; but shows that prayer is a\nkind of secret thing, which lies principally in the heart, and requires\na tranquillity of mind undisturbed by all cares. It was not without\nreason, therefore, that the Lord himself, when he would engage in an\nunusual vehemence of devotion, retired to some solitary place, far from\nthe tumult of men; but with a view to admonish us by his own example,\nthat we ought not to neglect these helps, by which our hearts, naturally\ntoo inconstant, are more intensely fixed on the devotional exercise. But\nnotwithstanding, as he did not refrain from praying even in the midst of\na multitude, if at any time the occasion required it, so we, in all\nplaces where it may be necessary, should “lift up holy hands.”[389] And\nso it is to be concluded, that whoever refuses to pray in the solemn\nassembly of the saints, knows nothing of private prayer, either solitary\nor domestic. And again, that he who neglects solitary and private\nprayer, how sedulously soever he may frequent the public assemblies,\nonly forms there such as are mere wind, because he pays more deference\nto the opinion of men than to the secret judgment of God. In the mean\ntime, that the common prayers of the Church might not sink into\ncontempt, God anciently distinguished them by splendid titles,\nespecially when he called the temple a “house of prayer.”[390] For by\nthis expression he taught both that the duty of prayer is a principal\npart of his worship, and that the temple had been erected as a standard\nfor believers, in order that they might engage in it with one consent.\nThere was also added a remarkable promise: “Praise waiteth for thee, O\nGod, in Sion; and unto thee shall the vow be performed;”[391] in which\nwords the Psalmist informs us that the prayers of the Church are never\nin vain, because the Lord supplies his people with perpetual matter of\npraise and joy. But though the legal shadows have ceased, yet since it\nhas been the Divine will by this ceremony to maintain a unity of faith\namong us also, the same promise undoubtedly belongs to us, Christ having\nconfirmed it with his own mouth, and Paul having represented it as\nperpetually valid.\nXXX. Now, as God in his word commands believers to unite in common\nprayers, so also it is necessary that public temples be appointed for\nperforming them; where they who refuse to join with the people of God in\ntheir devotions, have no just reason for abusing this pretext, that they\nenter into their closets, in obedience to the Divine mandate. For he who\npromises to grant whatever shall be implored by two or three persons\nconvened in his name,[392] proves that he is far from despising prayers\noffered in public; provided they be free from ostentation and a desire\nof human applause, and accompanied with a sincere and real affection\ndwelling in the secret recesses of the heart. If this be the legitimate\nuse of temples, as it certainly is, there is need of great caution, lest\nwe either consider them as the proper habitations of the Deity, where he\nmay be nearer to us to hear our prayers,—an idea which has begun to be\nprevalent for several ages,—or ascribe to them I know not what\nmysterious sanctity, which might be supposed to render our devotions\nmore holy in the Divine view. For since we are ourselves the true\ntemples of God, we must pray within ourselves, if we wish to invoke him\nin his holy temple. But let us, who are directed to worship the Lord “in\nspirit and in truth,”[393] without any difference of place, relinquish\nthose gross ideas of religion to the Jews or pagans. There was, indeed,\nanciently a temple dedicated, by Divine command, to the oblation of\nprayers and sacrifices: at that time the truth was figuratively\nconcealed under such shadows; but now, having been plainly discovered to\nus, it no longer permits an exclusive attachment to any material temple.\nNor, indeed, was the temple recommended to the Jews that they might\nenclose the Divine presence within its walls, but that they might be\nemployed in contemplating a representation of the true temple. Therefore\nIsaiah and Stephen have sharply reprehended those who suppose that God\ndwells in any respect “in temples made with hands.”[394]\nXXXI. Hence it is moreover clearly evident, that neither voice nor\nsinging, if used in prayer, has any validity, or produces the least\nbenefit with God, unless it proceed from the inmost desire of the heart.\nBut they rather provoke his wrath against us, if they be only emitted\nfrom the lips and throat; since that is an abuse of his sacred name, and\na derision of his majesty; as we conclude from the words of Isaiah,\nwhich, though their meaning be more extensive, contain also a reproof of\nthis offence: “The Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with\ntheir mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their\nheart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of\nmen,—therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among\nthis people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of\ntheir wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men\nshall be hid.”[395] Nor do we here condemn the use of the voice, or\nsinging, but rather highly recommend them, provided they accompany the\naffection of the heart. For they exercise the mind in Divine meditation,\nand fix the attention of the heart; which by its lubricity and\nversatility is easily relaxed and distracted to a variety of objects,\nunless it be supported by various helps. Besides, as the glory of God\nought in some respect to be manifested in every part of our bodies, to\nthis service, both in singing and in speaking, it becomes us especially\nto addict and devote our tongues, which were created for the express\npurpose of declaring and celebrating the Divine praises. Nevertheless\nthe principal use of the tongue is in the public prayers which are made\nin the congregations of believers; the design of which is, that with one\ncommon voice, and as it were with the same mouth, we may all at once\nproclaim the glory of God, whom we worship in one spirit and with the\nsame faith; and this is publicly done, that all interchangeably, each\none of his brother, may receive the confession of faith, and be invited\nand stimulated by his example.\nXXXII. Now, the custom of singing in churches (to speak of it by the\nway) not only appears to be very ancient, but that it was even used by\nthe apostles, may be concluded from these words of Paul: “I will sing\nwith the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.”[396]\nAgain, to the Colossians: “Teaching and admonishing one another in\npsalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your\nhearts to the Lord.”[397] For in the former passage he inculcates\nsinging with the voice and with the heart; and in the latter he\nrecommends spiritual songs, which may conduce to the mutual edification\nof the saints. Yet that it was not universal is proved by Augustine, who\nrelates that in the time of Ambrose, the church at Milan first adopted\nthe practice of singing, when, during the persecution of the orthodox\nfaith by Justina, the mother of Valentinian, the people were unusually\nassiduous in their vigils; and that the other Western churches followed.\nFor he had just before mentioned that this custom had been derived from\nthe churches of the East. He signifies also, in the second book of his\nRetractations, that in his time it was received in Africa. “One Hilary,\n(says he,) who held the tribunitial office, took every opportunity of\nloading with malicious censures the custom which was then introduced at\nCarthage, that hymns from the Book of Psalms should be sung at the\naltar, either before the oblation, or while that which had been offered\nwas distributed to the people. In obedience to the commands of my\nbrethren, I answered him.” And certainly if singing be attempered to\nthat gravity which becomes the presence of God and of angels, it adds a\ndignity and grace to sacred actions, and is very efficacious in exciting\nthe mind to a true concern and ardour of devotion. Yet great caution is\nnecessary, that the ears be not more attentive to the modulation of the\nnotes, than the mind to the spiritual import of the words. With which\ndanger Augustine confesses himself to have been so affected, as\nsometimes to have wished for the observance of the custom instituted by\nAthanasius, who directed that the reader should sound the words with\nsuch a gentle inflection of voice, as would be more nearly allied to\nrehearsing than to singing. But when he recollected the great benefit\nwhich himself had received from singing, he inclined to the other side.\nWith the observance, therefore, of this limitation, it is without doubt\nan institution of great solemnity and usefulness. As, on the reverse,\nwhatever music is composed only to please and delight the ear, is\nunbecoming the majesty of the Church, and cannot but be highly\ndispleasing to God.\nXXXIII. Hence also it plainly appears, that public prayers are to be\ncomposed, not in Greek among the Latins, nor in Latin among the French\nor English, as has hitherto been universally practised; but in the\nvernacular tongue, which may be generally understood by the whole\ncongregation; for it ought to be conducted to the edification of the\nwhole Church, to whom not the least benefit can result from sounds which\nthey do not understand. But they who disregard the voice both of charity\nand of humanity, ought at least to discover some little respect for the\nauthority of Paul, whose words are free from all ambiguity: “When thou\nshalt bless with the Spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the\nunlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not\nwhat thou sayest? For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is\nnot edified.”[398] Who, then, can sufficiently wonder at the unbridled\nlicense of the Papists, who, notwithstanding this apostolic caution\nagainst it, are not afraid to bellow their verbose prayers in a foreign\nlanguage, of which they neither sometimes understand a syllable\nthemselves, nor wish a syllable to be understood by others! But Paul\ndirects to a different practice: “What is it then? (says he) I will pray\nwith the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will\nsing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.”[399]\nSignifying by the word _spirit_ the peculiar gift of tongues, which was\nabused by some of its possessors, when they separated it from\nunderstanding. Thus it must be fully admitted, that both in public and\nin private prayer, the tongue, unaccompanied by the heart, cannot but be\nhighly displeasing to God; and likewise that the mind ought to be\nincited, in the ardour of meditation, to rise to a much higher elevation\nthan can ever be attained by the expression of the tongue; lastly, that\nthe tongue is indeed not necessary to private prayer, any further than\nas the mind is insufficient to arouse itself, or as the vehemence of its\nemotions irresistibly carries the tongue along with them. For though\nsome of the best prayers are not vocal, yet it is very common, under\nstrong emotions, for the tongue to break forth into sounds, and the\nother members into gestures, without the least ostentation. Hence the\nuncertain muttering of Hannah,[400] somewhat similar to which is\nexperienced by the saints in all ages, when they break forth into abrupt\nand imperfect sounds. The corporeal gestures usually observed in prayer,\nsuch as kneeling and uncovering the head, are customs designed to\nincrease our reverence of God.\nXXXIV. Now, we must learn not only a certain rule, but also the form of\npraying; even that which our heavenly Father has given us by his beloved\nSon;[401] in which we may recognize his infinite goodness and clemency.\nFor beside advising and exhorting us to seek him in all our necessities,\nas children, whenever they are afflicted with any distress, are\naccustomed to have recourse to the protection of their parents; seeing\nthat we did not sufficiently perceive how great was our poverty, what it\nwas right to implore, or what would be suitable to our condition, he has\nprovided a remedy even for this our ignorance, and abundantly supplied\nthe deficiencies of our capacity. For he has prescribed for us a form,\nin which he gives a statement of all that it is lawful to desire of him,\nall that is conducive to our benefit, and all that it is necessary to\nask. From this kindness of his, we derive great consolation in the\npersuasion that we pray for nothing absurd, nothing injurious or\nunseasonable; in a word, nothing but what is agreeable to him; since our\npetitions are almost in his own words. Plato, observing the ignorance of\nmen in presenting their supplications to God, which if granted were\nfrequently very detrimental to them, pronounces this to be the best\nmethod of praying, borrowed from an ancient poet: “King Jupiter, give us\nthose things which are best, whether we pray for them or not; but\ncommand evil things to remain at a distance from us, even though we\nimplore them.” And indeed the wisdom of that heathen is conspicuous in\nthis instance, since he considers it as very dangerous to supplicate the\nLord to gratify all the dictates of our appetites; and at the same time\ndiscovers our infelicity, who cannot, without danger, even open our\nmouths in the presence of God, unless we be instructed by the Spirit in\nthe right rule of prayer.[402] And this privilege deserves to be the\nmore highly valued by us, since the only begotten Son of God puts words\ninto our mouths, which may deliver our minds from all hesitation.\nXXXV. This form or rule of prayer, whichever appellation be given to it,\nis composed of six petitions. For my reason for not agreeing with those\nwho divide it into seven parts is, that the Evangelist appears, by the\ninsertion of the adversative conjunction, to connect together these two\nclauses; as though he had said, Suffer us not to be oppressed with\ntemptation, but rather succour our weakness, and deliver us, that we may\nnot fall. The ancient writers of the Church also are of our opinion; so\nthat what is now added in Matthew in the seventh place, must be\nexplained as belonging to the sixth petition. Now, though the whole\nprayer is such, that in every part of it the principal regard must be\npaid to the glory of God, yet to this the first three petitions are\nparticularly devoted, and to this alone we ought to attend in them,\nwithout any consideration of our own interest. The remaining three\nconcern ourselves, and are expressly assigned to supplications for those\nthings which tend to our benefit. As when we pray that God’s name may be\nhallowed, since he chooses to prove whether our love and worship of him\nbe voluntary, or dictated by mercenary motives, we must then think\nnothing of our own interest, but his glory must be proposed as the only\nobject of our fixed attention; nor is it lawful for us to be differently\naffected in the other petitions of this class. And this indeed conduces\nto our great benefit; because, when the Divine name is hallowed or\nsanctified as we pray, it becomes likewise our sanctification. But our\neyes should overlook, and be, as it were, blind to such advantage, so as\nnot to pay the least regard to it. And even if we were deprived of all\nhope of private benefit, yet this hallowing, and the other things which\npertain to the glory of God, ought still to be the objects of our\ndesires and of our prayers. This is conspicuous in the examples of Moses\nand Paul,[403] who felt a pleasure in averting their minds and eyes from\nthemselves, and in praying with vehement and ardent zeal for their own\ndestruction, that they might promote the kingdom and glory of God even\nat the expense of their own happiness. On the other hand, when we pray\nthat our daily bread may be given us, although we wish for what is\nbeneficial to ourselves, yet here also we ought principally to aim at\nthe glory of God, so as not even to ask it, unless it tend to his glory.\nNow, let us attempt an explanation of the prayer itself.\nXXXVI. OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN, &c. The first idea that occurs is,\nwhat we have before asserted, that we ought never to present a prayer to\nGod but in the name of Christ, since no other name can recommend it to\nhis regard. For by calling God our Father, we certainly plead the name\nof Christ. For with what confidence could any one call God his Father?\nwho could proceed to such a degree of temerity, as to arrogate to\nhimself the dignity of a son of God, if we had not been adopted as the\nchildren of his grace in Christ? who, being his true Son, has been given\nby him to us as our brother, that the character which properly belongs\nto him by nature, may become ours by the blessing of adoption, if we\nreceive this inestimable favour with a steady faith; as John says, that\nto them is given “power to become the sons of God, even to them that\nbelieve on the name of the only begotten of the Father.”[404] Therefore\nhe denominates himself our Father, and wishes us to give him the same\nappellation; delivering us from all diffidence by the great sweetness of\nthis name, since the affection of love can nowhere be found in a\nstronger degree than in the heart of a father. Therefore he could not\ngive us a more certain proof of his infinite love towards us, than by\nour being denominated the sons of God. But his love to us is as much\ngreater and more excellent than all the love of our parents, as he is\nsuperior to all men in goodness and mercy;[405] so that though all the\nfathers in the world, divested of every emotion of paternal affection,\nshould leave their children destitute, he will never forsake us, because\n“he cannot deny himself.”[406] For we have his promise, “If ye, then,\nbeing evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much\nmore shall your Father which is in heaven?”[407] Again, in the prophet:\n“Can a woman forget her child? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not\nforget thee.”[408] But if we are his sons, then, as a son cannot commit\nhimself to the protection of a stranger and an alien, without at the\nsame time complaining of the cruelty or poverty of his father, so\nneither can we seek supplies for our wants from any other quarter than\nfrom him, without charging him with indigence and inability, or with\ncruelty and excessive austerity.\nXXXVII. Neither let us plead that we are justly terrified by a\nconsciousness of our sins, which may cause even a merciful, kind Father\nto be daily offended with us. For if, among men, a son can conduct his\ncause with his father by no better advocate, can conciliate and recover\nhis lost favour by no better mediator, than by approaching him as an\nhumble suppliant, acknowledging his own guilt, and imploring his\nfather’s mercy, (for the bowels of a father could not conceal their\nemotions at such supplications,) what will he do, who is “the Father of\nmercies, and the God of all comfort?”[409] Will he not hear the cries\nand groans of his children when they deprecate his displeasure for\nthemselves, especially since it is to this that he invites and exhorts\nus; rather than attend to any intercessions of others, to which they\nresort in great consternation, not without some degree of despair,\narising from a doubt of the kindness and clemency of their Father? Of\nthis exuberance of paternal kindness, he gives us a beautiful\nrepresentation in a parable;[410] where a father meets and embraces a\nson who had alienated himself from his family, who had dissolutely\nlavished his substance, who had grievously offended him in every\nrespect: nor does he wait till he actually supplicates for pardon, but\nanticipates him, recognizes him when returning at a great distance,\nvoluntarily runs to meet him, consoles him, and receives him into\nfavour. For by proposing to our view an example of such great kindness\nin a man, he intended to teach us how much more abundant compassion we\nought, notwithstanding our ingratitude, rebellion, and wickedness, to\nexpect from him, who is not only our Father, but the most benevolent and\nmerciful of all fathers, provided we only cast ourselves on his mercy.\nAnd to give us the more certain assurance that he is such a Father, if\nwe be Christians, he will be called not only “Father,” but expressly\n“Our Father;” as though we might address him in the following manner: O\nFather, whose affection towards thy children is so strong, and whose\nreadiness to pardon them is so great, we thy children invoke thee and\npray to thee, under the assurance and full persuasion that thou hast no\nother than a paternal affection towards us, how unworthy soever we are\nof such a Father. But because the contracted capacities of our minds\ncannot conceive of a favour of such immense magnitude, we not only have\nChrist as the pledge and earnest of adoption, but as a witness of this\nadoption he gives us the Spirit, by whom we are enabled with a loud\nvoice freely to cry, “Abba, Father.”[411] Whenever, therefore, we may be\nembarrassed by any difficulty, let us remember to supplicate him, that\nhe will correct our timidity, and give us this spirit of magnanimity to\nenable us to pray with boldness.\nXXXVIII. But since we are not instructed, that every individual should\nappropriate him to himself exclusively as his Father, but rather that we\nshould all in common call him Our Father, we are thereby admonished how\nstrong a fraternal affection ought to prevail among us, who, by the same\nprivilege of mercy and free grace, are equally the children of such a\nFather. For if we all have one common Father,[412] from whom proceeds\nevery blessing we enjoy, there ought to be nothing exclusively\nappropriated by any among us, but what we should be ready to communicate\nto each other with the greatest alacrity of heart, whenever necessity\nrequires. Now, if we desire, as we ought, to exert ourselves for our\nmutual assistance, there is nothing in which we can better promote the\ninterests of our brethren, than by commending them to the providential\ncare of our most benevolent Father, with whose mercy and favour no other\nwant can be experienced. And, indeed, this is a debt which we owe to our\nFather himself. For as he who truly and cordially loves any father of a\nfamily, feels likewise a love and friendship for his whole household, in\nthe same manner, our zeal and affection towards this heavenly Father\nmust be shown towards his people, his family, his inheritance, whom he\nhas dignified with the honourable appellation of the “fulness” of his\nonly begotten Son.[413] Let a Christian, then, regulate his prayers by\nthis rule, that they be common, and comprehend all who are his brethren\nin Christ; and not only those whom he at present sees and knows to be\nsuch, but all men in the world; respecting whom, what God has determined\nis beyond our knowledge; only that to wish and hope the best concerning\nthem, is equally the dictate of piety and of humanity. It becomes us,\nhowever, to exercise a peculiar and superior affection “unto them who\nare of the household of faith;” whom the apostle has in every case\nrecommended to our particular regards.[414] In a word, all our prayers\nought to be such, as to respect that community which our Lord has\nestablished in his kingdom and in his family.\nXXXIX. Yet this is no objection to the lawfulness of particular prayers,\nboth for ourselves and for other certain individuals; provided our minds\nbe not withdrawn from a regard to this community, nor even diverted from\nit, but refer every thing to this point. For though the words of them be\nsingular, yet as they are directed to this end, they cease not to be\ncommon. All this may be rendered very intelligible by a similitude. God\nhas given a general command to relieve the wants of all the poor; and\nyet this is obeyed by them who to that end succour the indigence of\nthose whom they either know or see to be labouring under poverty; even\nthough they pass by multitudes who are oppressed with necessities\nequally severe, because neither their knowledge nor ability can extend\nto all. In the same manner, no opposition is made to the Divine will by\nthem who, regarding and considering this common society of the Church,\npresent such particular prayers, in which, with a public spirit, but in\nparticular terms, they recommend to God themselves or others, whose\nnecessity he has placed within their more immediate knowledge. However,\nthere is not a perfect similarity in every respect between prayer and\ndonation of alms, for munificence cannot be exercised but towards them\nwhose wants we have perceived; but we may assist by our prayers even the\ngreatest strangers, and those with whom we are the most unacquainted,\nhow distant soever they may be from us. This is done by that general\nform of prayer, which comprehends all the children of God, among whom\nthey also are numbered. To this may be referred the exhortation which\nPaul gives believers of his age, “that men pray every where, lifting up\nholy hands without wrath;”[415] because by admonishing them, that\ndiscord shuts the gate against prayers, he advises them unanimously to\nunite all their petitions together.\nXL. It is added, THAT HE IS IN HEAVEN. From which it is not hastily to\nbe inferred, that he is included and circumscribed within the\ncircumference of heaven, as by certain barriers. For Solomon confesses,\nthat “the heaven of heavens cannot contain” him.[416] And he says\nhimself, by the prophet, “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my\nfootstool.”[417] By which he clearly signifies that he is not limited to\nany particular region, but diffused throughout all space. But because\nthe dulness of our minds could not otherwise conceive of his ineffable\nglory, it is designated to us by the heaven, than which we can behold\nnothing more august or more majestic. Since, then, wherever our senses\napprehend any thing, there they are accustomed to fix it, God is\nrepresented as beyond all place, that when we seek him we may be\nelevated above all reach of both body and soul. Moreover, by this form\nof expression, he is exalted above all possibility of corruption or\nmutation: finally, it is signified, that he comprehends and contains the\nwhole world, and governs the universe by his power. Wherefore, this is\nthe same as if he had been said to be possessed of an incomprehensible\nessence, infinite magnitude or sublimity, irresistible power, and\nunlimited immortality. But when we hear this, our thoughts must be\nraised to a higher elevation when God is mentioned; that we may not\nentertain any terrestrial or carnal imaginations concerning him, that we\nmay not measure him by our diminutive proportions, or judge of his will\nby our affections. We should likewise be encouraged to place the most\nimplicit reliance on him, by whose providence and power we understand\nboth heaven and earth to be governed. To conclude: under the name of\n“Our Father” is represented to us, that God who has appeared to us in\nhis own image, that we might call upon him with a steady faith; and the\nfamiliar appellation of Father is not only adapted to produce\nconfidence, but also efficacious to prevent our minds from being seduced\nto dubious or fictitious deities, and to cause them to ascend from the\nonly begotten Son to the common Father of angels and of saints;\nmoreover, when his throne is placed in heaven, we are reminded by his\ngovernment of the world, that it is not in vain for us to approach to\nhim who makes us the objects of his present and voluntary care. “He that\ncometh to God (says the apostle) must believe that he is, and that he is\na rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”[418] Christ asserts both\nthese of his Father, that we may have first a firm faith in his\nexistence, and then a certain persuasion that, since he deigns to extend\nhis providence to us, he will not neglect our salvation. By these\nprinciples, Paul prepares us for praying in right manner; for his\nexhortation, “Let your requests be made known unto God,” is thus\nprefaced: “The Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing.”[419] Whence it\nappears, that their prayers must be attended with great doubt and\nperplexity of mind, who are not well established in this truth, that\n“the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous.”[420]\nXLI. The first petition is, THAT GOD’S NAME MAY BE HALLOWED; the\nnecessity of which is connected with our great disgrace. For what is\nmore shameful, than that the Divine glory should be obscured partly by\nour ingratitude, partly by our malignity, and, as far as possible,\nobliterated by our presumption, infatuation, and perverseness?\nNotwithstanding all the sacrilegious rage and clamours of the impious,\nyet the refulgence of holiness still adorns the Divine name. Nor does\nthe Psalmist without reason exclaim, “According to thy name, O God, so\nis thy praise unto the ends of the earth.”[421] For wherever God may be\nknown, there must necessarily be a manifestation of his perfections of\npower, goodness, wisdom, righteousness, mercy, and truth, which command\nour admiration and excite us to celebrate his praise. Therefore, because\nGod is so unjustly robbed of his holiness on earth, if it is not in our\npower to assert it for him, we are at least commanded to regard it in\nour prayers. The substance of it is, that we wish God to receive all the\nhonour that he deserves, that men may never speak or think of him but\nwith the highest reverence; to which is opposed that profanation, which\nhas always been too common in the world, as it continues to be in the\npresent age. And hence the necessity of this petition, which, if we were\ninfluenced by only a tolerable degree of piety, ought to be superfluous.\nBut if the name of God be truly hallowed, when separated from all others\nit breathes pure glory, we are here commanded to pray, not only that God\nwill vindicate his holy name from all contempt and ignominy, but also\nthat he will constrain all mankind to revere it. Now, as God manifests\nhimself to us partly by his word, and partly by his works, he is no\notherwise hallowed by us, than if we attribute to him in both instances\nthat which belongs to him, and so receive whatever proceeds from him;\nascribing, moreover, equal praise to his severity and to his clemency;\nsince on the multiplicity and variety of his works he has impressed\ncharacters of his glory, which should draw from every tongue a\nconfession of his praise. Thus will the Scripture obtain a just\nauthority with us, nor will any event obstruct the benedictions which\nGod deserves in the whole course of his government of the world. The\ntendency of the petition is, further, that all impiety which sullies\nthis holy name, may be utterly abolished; that whatever obscures or\ndiminishes this hallowing, whether detraction or derision, may\ndisappear; and that while God restrains all sacrilege, his majesty may\nshine with increasing splendour.\nXLII. The second petition is, THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD MAY COME; which,\nthough it contains nothing new, is yet not without reason distinguished\nfrom the first; because, if we consider our inattention in the most\nimportant of all concerns, it is useful for that which ought of itself\nto have been most intimately known to us, to be inculcated in a variety\nof words. Therefore, after we have been commanded to pray to God to\nsubdue, and at length utterly to destroy, every thing that sullies his\nholy name, there is now added another petition, similar and almost\nidentically the same—That his kingdom may come. Now, though we have\nalready given a definition of this kingdom, I now briefly repeat, that\nGod reigns when men, renouncing themselves and despising the world and\nthe present state, submit themselves to his righteousness, so as to\naspire to the heavenly state. Thus this kingdom consists of two parts;\nthe one, God’s correcting by the power of his Spirit all our carnal and\ndepraved appetites, which oppose him in great numbers; the other, his\nforming all our powers to an obedience to his commands. No others\ntherefore observe a proper order in this petition, but they who begin\nfrom themselves, that is, that they may be purified from all corruptions\nwhich disturb the tranquillity, or violate the purity, of God’s kingdom.\nNow, since the Divine word resembles a royal sceptre, we are commanded\nto pray that he will subdue the hearts and minds of all men to a\nvoluntary obedience to it. This is accomplished, when, by the secret\ninspiration of his Spirit, he displays the efficacy of his word, and\ncauses it to obtain the honour it deserves. Afterwards, it is our duty\nto descend to the impious, by whom his authority is resisted with the\nperseverance of obstinacy and the fury of despair. God therefore erects\nhis kingdom on the humiliation of the whole world, though his methods of\nhumiliation are various; for he restrains the passions of some, and\nbreaks the unsubdued arrogance of others. It ought to be the object of\nour daily wishes, that God would collect churches for himself from all\nthe countries of the earth, that he would enlarge their numbers, enrich\nthem with gifts, and establish a legitimate order among them; that, on\nthe contrary, he would overthrow all the enemies of the pure doctrine\nand religion, that he would confound their counsels, and defeat their\nattempts. Whence it appears that the desire of a daily progress is not\nenjoined us in vain; because human affairs are never in such a happy\nsituation, as that all defilement of sin is removed, and purity can be\nseen in full perfection. This perfection is deferred till the last\nadvent of Christ, when, the apostle says, “God will be all in all.”[422]\nAnd so this petition ought to withdraw us from all the corruptions of\nthe world, which separate us from God, and prevent his kingdom from\nflourishing within us; it ought likewise to inflame us with an ardent\ndesire of mortifying the flesh, and finally to teach us to bear the\ncross; since these are the means which God chooses for the extension of\nhis kingdom. Nor should we be impatient that the outward man is\ndestroyed, provided the inward man be renewed. For this is the order of\nthe kingdom of God, that, when we submit to his righteousness, he makes\nus partakers of his glory. This is accomplished, when, discovering his\nlight and truth with perpetual accession of splendour, before which the\nshades and falsehoods of Satan and of his kingdom vanish and become\nextinct, he by the aids of his Spirit directs his children into the path\nof rectitude, and strengthens them to perseverance; but defeats the\nimpious conspiracies of his enemies, confounds their insidious and\nfraudulent designs, disappoints their malice, and represses their\nobstinacy, till at length “he” will “consume” Antichrist “with the\nspirit of his mouth, and destroy” all impiety “with the brightness of\nhis coming.”[423]\nXLIII. The third petition is, THAT THE WILL OF GOD MAY BE DONE ON EARTH\nAS IT IS IN HEAVEN; which, though it is an appendage to his kingdom, and\ncannot be disjoined from it, is yet not without reason separately\nmentioned, on account of our ignorance, which does not apprehend with\nfacility what it is for God to reign in the world. There will be nothing\nabsurd, then, in understanding this as an explanation, that God’s\nkingdom will then prevail in the world, when all shall submit to his\nwill. Now, we speak not here of his secret will, by which he governs all\nthings, and appoints them to fulfil his own purposes. For though Satan\nand men oppose him with all the violence of rage, yet his\nincomprehensible wisdom is able, not only to divert their impetuosity,\nbut to overrule it for the accomplishment of his decrees. But the Divine\nwill here intended, is that to which voluntary obedience corresponds;\nand therefore heaven is expressly compared with the earth, because the\nangels, as the Psalmist says, spontaneously “do his commandments,\nhearkening unto the voice of his word.”[424] We are therefore commanded\nto desire that, as in heaven nothing is done but according to the Divine\nwill, and the angels are placidly conformed to every thing that is\nright, so the earth, all obstinacy and depravity being annihilated, may\nbe subject to the same government. And in praying for this, we renounce\nour own carnal desires; because, unless we resign all our affections to\nGod, we are guilty of all the opposition in our power to his will, for\nnothing proceeds from us but what is sinful. And we are likewise\nhabituated by this petition to a renunciation of ourselves, that God may\nrule us according to his own pleasure; and not only so, but that he may\nalso create in us new minds and new hearts, annihilating our own, that\nwe may experience no emotion of desire within us, but a mere consent to\nhis will; in a word, that we may have no will of our own, but that our\nhearts may be governed by his Spirit, by whose internal teachings we may\nlearn to love those things which please him, and to hate those which he\ndisapproves; consequently, that he may render abortive all those desires\nwhich are repugnant to his will. These are the three first clauses of\nthis prayer, in praying which we ought solely to have in view the glory\nof God, omitting all consideration of ourselves, and not regarding any\nadvantage of our own, which, though they largely contribute to it,\nshould not be our end in these petitions. But though all these things,\neven if we never think of them, nor wish for them, nor request them,\nmust nevertheless happen in their appointed time, yet they ought to be\nthe objects of our wishes, and the subjects of our prayers. And such\npetitions it will be highly proper for us to offer, that we may testify\nand profess ourselves to be the servants and sons of God; manifesting\nthe sincerest devotedness, and making the most zealous efforts in our\npower for advancing the honour which is due to him, both as a Master and\nas a Father. Persons, therefore, who are not incited, by this ardent\nzeal for promoting the glory of God, to pray, that his name may be\nhallowed, that his kingdom may come, and that his will may be done, are\nnot to be numbered among his sons and servants; and as all these things\nwill be accomplished in opposition to their inclinations, so they will\ncontribute to their confusion and destruction.\nXLIV. Next follows the second part of the prayer, in which we descend to\nour own interests; not that we must dismiss all thoughts of the Divine\nglory, (which, according to Paul,[425] should be regarded even in eating\nand drinking,) and only seek what is advantageous to ourselves; but we\nhave already announced that this is the distinction—that God, by\nexclusively claiming three petitions, absorbs us entirely in the\nconsideration of himself, that thus he may prove our piety; afterwards\nhe permits us to attend to our own interests, yet on this condition,\nthat the end of all our requests be the illustration of his glory, by\nwhatever benefits he confers on us, since nothing is more reasonable\nthan that we live and die to him. But the first petition of the second\npart, GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD, is a general request to God for\na supply of all our corporeal wants in the present state, not only for\nfood and clothing, but also for every thing which he sees to be\nconducive to our good, that we may eat our bread in peace. By this we\nbriefly surrender ourselves to his care, and commit ourselves to his\nprovidence, that he may feed, nourish, and preserve us. For our most\nbenevolent Father disdains not to receive even our body into his charge\nand protection, that he may exercise our faith in these minute\ncircumstances, while we expect every thing from him, even down to a\ncrumb of bread and a drop of water. For since it is a strange effect of\nour iniquity, to be affected and distressed with greater solicitude for\nthe body than for the soul, many, who venture to confide to God the\ninterests of their souls, are nevertheless still solicitous concerning\nthe body, still anxious what they shall eat and what they shall wear;\nand unless they have an abundance of corn, wine, and oil, for the supply\nof their future wants, tremble with fear. Of so much greater importance\nto us is the shadow of this transitory life, than that eternal\nimmortality. But they who, confiding in God, have once cast off that\nanxiety for the concerns of the body, expect likewise to receive from\nhim superior blessings, even salvation and eternal life. It is therefore\nno trivial exercise of faith, to expect from God those things which\notherwise fill us with so much anxiety; nor is it a small proficiency\nwhen we have divested ourselves of this infidelity, which is almost\nuniversally interwoven with the human constitution. The speculations of\nsome, concerning supernatural bread, appear to me not very consonant to\nthe meaning of Christ; for if we did not ascribe to God the character of\nour Supporter even in this transitory life, our prayer would be\ndefective. The reason which they allege has too much profanity; that it\nis unbecoming for the children of God, who ought to be spiritual, not\nonly to devote their own attention to terrestrial cares, but also to\ninvolve God in the same anxieties with themselves; as though, truly, his\nbenediction and paternal favour were not conspicuous even in our\nsustenance; or there were no meaning in the assertion, that “godliness\nhath promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to\ncome.”[426] Now, though remission of sins is of much greater value than\ncorporeal aliments, yet Christ has given the first place to the inferior\nblessing, that he might gradually raise us to the two remaining\npetitions, which properly pertain to the heavenly life; in which he has\nconsulted our dulness. We are commanded to ask “our bread,” that we may\nbe content with the portion which our heavenly Father deigns to allot\nus, nor practise any illicit arts for the love of lucre. In the mean\ntime, it must be understood that it becomes ours by a title of donation;\nbecause neither our industry, nor our labour, nor our hands, as is\nobserved by Moses,[427] acquire any thing for us of themselves, when\nunattended by the Divine blessing; and that even an abundance of bread\nwould not be of the least service to us, unless it were by the Divine\npower converted into nourishment. And therefore this liberality of God\nis equally as necessary to the rich as to the poor; for though their\nbarns and cellars were full, they would faint with hunger and thirst,\nunless through his goodness they enjoyed their food. The expression\n“this day,” or “day by day,” as it is in the other Evangelist, and the\nepithet _daily_, restrain the inordinate desire of transitory things,\nwith which we are often violently inflamed, and which leads to other\nevils; since if we have a greater abundance, we fondly lavish it away in\npleasure, delights, ostentation, and other kinds of luxury. Therefore we\nare enjoined to ask only as much as will supply our necessity, and as it\nwere for the present day, with this confidence, that our heavenly\nFather, after having fed us to-day, will not fail us to-morrow. Whatever\naffluence, then, we possess, even when our barns and cellars are full,\nyet it behoves us always to ask for our daily bread; because it must be\nconsidered as an undeniable truth, that all property is nothing, any\nfurther than the Lord, by the effusions of his favour, blesses it with\ncontinual improvement; and that even what we have in our possession is\nnot our own, any further than as he hourly bestows on us some portion of\nit, and grants us the use of it. Since the pride of man does not easily\nsuffer itself to be convinced of this, the Lord declares that he has\ngiven to all ages an eminent proof of it, by feeding his people with\nmanna in the desert, in order to apprize us “that man doth not live by\nbread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of his mouth;”[428]\nwhich implies, that it is his power alone by which our life and strength\nare sustained, although he communicates it to us by corporeal means; as\nhe is accustomed to teach us likewise by an opposite example, when he\nbreaks, at his pleasure, the strength (and, as he himself calls it, “the\nstaff”) of bread, so that though men eat they pine with hunger, and\nthough they drink are parched with thirst.[429] Now, they who are not\nsatisfied with daily bread, but whose avidity is insatiable, and whose\ndesires are unbounded, and they who are satiated with their abundance,\nand think themselves secure amid their immense riches, and who\nnevertheless supplicate the Divine Being in this petition, are guilty of\nmocking him. For the former ask what they would not wish to obtain, and\neven what most of all they abominate, that is, daily bread only; they\nconceal from God, as much as they can, their avaricious disposition;\nwhereas true prayer ought to pour out before him the whole mind, and all\nthe inmost secrets of the soul; and the latter implore what they are far\nfrom expecting to receive from him, what they think they have in their\nown possession. In its being called “ours,” the Divine goodness is, as\nwe have observed, the more conspicuous, since it makes that _ours_, to\nwhich we have no claim of right. Yet we must not reject the explanation\nwhich I have likewise hinted at, that it intends also such as is\nacquired by just and innocent labour, and not procured by acts of\ndeception and rapine; because, whatever we acquire by any criminal\nmethods, is never our own, but belongs to others. Our praying that it\nmay be “given” to us signifies that it is the simple and gratuitous\ndonation of God, from what quarter soever we receive it; even when it\nmost of all appears to be obtained by our own skill and industry, and to\nbe procured by our own hands; since it is solely the effect of his\nblessing, that our labours are attended with success.\nXLV. It follows—FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS; in which petition, and the next,\nChrist has comprised whatever relates to the heavenly life; as in these\ntwo parts consists the spiritual covenant which God has made for the\nsalvation of his Church—“I will write my law in their hearts, and will\npardon their iniquities.”[430] Here Christ begins with remission of\nsins: immediately after, he subjoins a second favour—that God would\ndefend us by the power, and support us by the aid, of his Spirit, to\nenable us to stand unconquered against all temptations. Sins he calls\ndebts, because we owe the penalty of them—a debt we are altogether\nincapable of discharging, unless we are released by this remission,\nwhich is a pardon flowing from his gratuitous mercy, when he freely\ncancels these debts without any payment from us, being satisfied by his\nown mercy in Christ, who has once given himself for our redemption.\nThose, therefore, who rely on God’s being satisfied with their own\nmerits, or the merits of others, and persuade themselves that remission\nof sins is purchased by these satisfactions, have no interest in this\ngratuitous forgiveness; and while they call upon God in this form, they\nare only subscribing their own accusation, and even sealing their\ncondemnation with their own testimony. For they confess themselves\ndebtors, unless they are discharged by the benefit of remission, which\nnevertheless they accept not, but rather refuse, while they obtrude upon\nGod their own merits and satisfactions. For in this way they do not\nimplore his mercy, but appeal to his judgment. They who amuse themselves\nwith dreams of perfection, superseding the necessity of praying for\npardon, may have disciples whom itching ears lead into delusions; but it\nmust be clear that all whom they gain are perverted from Christ, since\nhe teaches all to confess their guilt, and receives none but sinners;\nnot that he would flatter and encourage sins, but because he knew that\nbelievers are never wholly free from the vices of their flesh, but\nalways remain obnoxious to the judgment of God. It ought, indeed, to be\nthe object of our desires and strenuous exertions, that, having fully\ndischarged every part of our duty, we may truly congratulate ourselves\nbefore God on being pure from every stain; but as it pleases God to\nrestore his image within us by degrees, so that some contagion always\nremains in our flesh, the remedy ought never to be neglected. Now, if\nChrist, by the authority given him by the Father, enjoins us, as long as\nwe live, to have recourse to prayer for the pardon of guilt, who will\ntolerate the new teachers, who endeavour to dazzle the eyes of the\nsimple with a visionary phantom of perfect innocence, and fill them with\na confidence in the possibility of their being delivered from all sin?\nwhich, according to John, is no other than making God a liar.[431] At\nthe same time, also, these worthless men, by obliterating one article,\nmutilate, and so totally invalidate, the covenant of God, in which we\nhave seen our salvation is contained; being thus guilty not only of\nsacrilege by separating things so united, but also of impiety and\ncruelty, by overwhelming miserable souls with despair, and of treachery\nto themselves and others, by contracting a habit of carelessness, in\ndiametrical opposition to the Divine mercy. The objection of some, that\nin wishing the advent of God’s kingdom, we desire at the same time the\nabolition of sin, is too puerile; because, in the first part of the\nprayer, we have an exhibition of the highest perfection, but here of\ninfirmity. Thus these two things are perfectly consistent, that in\naspiring towards the mark we may not neglect the remedies required by\nour necessity. Lastly, we pray that we may be forgiven AS WE FORGIVE OUR\nDEBTORS; that is, as we forgive and pardon all who have ever injured us,\neither by unjust actions or by contumelious language. Not that it is our\nprovince to forgive the guilt of sin and transgression; this is the\nprerogative of God alone: our forgiveness consists in divesting the mind\nof anger, enmity, and desire of revenge, and losing the memory of\ninjuries by a voluntary forgetfulness. Wherefore we must not pray to God\nfor forgiveness of sins, unless we also forgive all the offences and\ninjuries of others against us, either present or past. But if we retain\nany enmities in our minds, meditate acts of revenge, and seek\nopportunities of annoyance, and even if we do not endeavour to obtain\nreconciliation with our enemies, to oblige them by all kind offices, and\nto render them our friends,—we beseech God, by this petition, not to\ngrant us remission of sins. For we supplicate him to grant to us what we\ngrant to others. This is praying him not to grant it to us, unless we\ngrant it also. What do persons of this description gain by their prayers\nbut a heavier judgment? Lastly, it must be observed, that this is not a\ncondition, that he would forgive us as we forgive our debtors, because\nwe can merit his forgiveness of us by our forgiveness of others, as\nthough it described the cause of his forgiveness; but, by this\nexpression, the Lord intended, partly to comfort the weakness of our\nfaith; for he has added this as a sign, that we may be as certainly\nassured of remission of sins being granted us by him, as we are certain\nand conscious of our granting it to others; if, at the same time, our\nminds be freed and purified from all hatred, envy, and revenge; partly\nby this, as a criterion, he expunges from the number of his children,\nthose who, hasty to revenge and difficult to forgive, maintain\ninveterate enmities, and cherish in their own hearts towards others,\nthat indignation which they deprecate from themselves, that they may not\npresume to invoke him as their Father. Which is also clearly expressed\nby Luke in Christ’s own words.\nXLVI. The sixth petition is, LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION, BUT DELIVER US\nFROM EVIL. This, as we have said, corresponds to the promise respecting\nthe law of God to be engraven in our hearts. But because our obedience\nto God is not without continual warfare, and severe and arduous\nconflicts, we here pray for arms, and assistance to enable us to gain\nthe victory. This suggests to us our necessity, not only of the grace of\nthe Spirit within us to soften, bend, and direct our hearts to obedience\nto God, but also of his aid to render us invincible, in opposition to\nall the stratagems and violent assaults of Satan. Now, the forms of\ntemptations are many and various. For the corrupt conceptions of the\nmind, provoking us to transgressions of the law, whether suggested by\nour own concupiscence or excited by the devil, are temptations; and\nthings not evil in themselves, nevertheless become temptations through\nthe subtlety of the devil, when they are obtruded on our eyes in such a\nmanner that their intervention occasions our seduction or declension\nfrom God. And these temptations are either from prosperous, or from\nadverse events. From prosperous ones, as riches, power, honours; which\ngenerally dazzle men’s eyes by their glitter and external appearance of\ngoodness, and insnare them with their blandishments, that, caught with\nsuch delusions and intoxicated with such delights, they forget their\nGod. From unpropitious ones, as poverty, reproaches, contempt,\nafflictions, and other things of this kind; overcome with the bitterness\nand difficulty of which, they fall into despondency, cast away faith and\nhope, and at length become altogether alienated from God. To both these\nkinds of temptations which assail us, whether kindled within us by our\nconcupiscence, or presented to us by the craft of Satan, we pray our\nheavenly Father not to permit us to yield, but rather to sustain and\nraise us up with his hand, that, strong in his might, we may be able to\nstand firm against all the assaults of our malignant enemy, whatever\nimaginations he may inject into our minds; and also, that whatever is\npresented to us on either quarter, we may convert it to our benefit;\nthat is, by not being elated with prosperity or dejected with adversity.\nYet we do not here pray for an entire exemption from all temptations,\nwhich we very much need, to excite, stimulate, and animate us, lest we\nshould grow torpid with too much rest. For it was not without reason\nthat David wished to be tempted or tried; nor is it without cause that\nthe Lord daily tries his elect, chastising them by ignominy, poverty,\ntribulation, and the cross in various forms. But the temptations of God\nare widely different from those of Satan. Satan tempts to overthrow,\ncondemn, confound, and destroy. But God, that, by proving his people, he\nmay make a trial of their sincerity, to confirm their strength by\nexercising it, to mortify, purify, and refine their flesh, which,\nwithout such restraints, would run into the greatest excesses. Besides,\nSatan attacks persons unarmed and unprepared, to overwhelm the unwary.\n“God, with the temptation, also makes a way to escape, that they may be\nable to bear” whatever he brings upon them.[432] By the word _evil_,\nwhether we understand the devil or sin, is of little importance. Satan\nhimself, indeed, is the enemy that lies in wait for our life; but sin is\nthe weapon with which he seeks our destruction. Our petition therefore\nis, that we may not be overwhelmed and conquered by any temptations, but\nthat we may stand, strong in the power of the Lord, against all adverse\npowers that assault us, which is not to submit to temptations; that\nbeing taken into his custody and charge, and being secure in his\nprotection, we may persevere unconquered, and rise superior to sin,\ndeath, the gates of hell, and the whole kingdom of the devil. This is\nbeing delivered from evil. Here it must also be carefully remarked, that\nit is not in our power to contend with so powerful an enemy as the\ndevil, and sustain the violence of his assaults. Otherwise it would be\nuseless, or insulting, to supplicate from God what we already possessed\nin ourselves. Certainly, they who prepare themselves for such a combat\nwith self-confidence, are not sufficiently aware of the skill and\nprowess of the enemy that they have to meet. Now, we pray to be\ndelivered from his power, as from the mouth of a ravenous and raging\nlion, just about to tear us with his teeth and claws, and to swallow us\ndown his throat, unless the Lord snatch us from the jaws of death;\nknowing, at the same time, that if the Lord shall be present and fight\nfor us while we are silent, in his strength “we shall do\nvaliantly.”[433] Let others confide as they please in the native\nabilities and powers of free-will, which they suppose themselves to\npossess,—let it be sufficient for us, to stand and be strong in the\npower of God alone. But this petition comprehends more than at first\nappears. For if the Spirit of God is our strength for fighting the\nbattle with Satan, we shall not be able to gain the victory, till, being\nfull of him, we shall have laid aside all the infirmity of our flesh.\nWhen we pray for deliverance from Satan and sin, therefore, we pray to\nbe frequently enriched with new accessions of Divine grace; till, being\nquite filled with them, we may be able to triumph over all evil. To some\nthere appears a difficulty and harshness in our petition to God, that he\nwill not lead us into temptation, whereas, according to James, it is\ncontrary to his nature for him to tempt us.[434] But this objection has\nalready been partly answered, because our own lust is properly the cause\nof all the temptations that overcome us, and therefore we are charged\nwith the guilt. Nor does James intend any other than to assert the\nfutility and injustice of transferring to God the vices which we are\nconstrained to impute to ourselves, because we are conscious of our\nbeing guilty of them. But notwithstanding this, God may, when he sees\nfit, deliver us to Satan, abandon us to a reprobate mind and sordid\npassions, and so lead us into temptations, by a righteous yet often\nsecret judgment; the cause being frequently concealed from man, but, at\nthe same time, well known to him. Whence it is inferred, that there is\nno impropriety in this mode of expression, if we are persuaded that\nthere is any meaning in his frequent threatenings, that he will manifest\nhis vengeance on the reprobate, by smiting them with blindness and\nhardness of heart.\nXLVII. These three petitions, in which we particularly commend to God\nourselves and all our concerns, evidently prove, what we have before\nasserted, that the prayers of Christians ought to be public, and to\nregard the public edification of the Church, and the advancement of the\ncommunion of believers. For each individual does not supplicate the gift\nof any favour to himself in particular; but we all in common pray for\nour bread, the remission of our sins, that we may not be led into\ntemptation, that we may be delivered from evil. The cause is likewise\nsubjoined, which gives us such great boldness in asking, and confidence\nof obtaining; which, though not to be found in the Latin copies, yet\nappears too apposite to this place to be omitted—namely, HIS IS THE\nKINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND THE GLORY FOR EVER. This is a solid and\nsecure basis for our faith; for if our prayers were to be recommended to\nGod by our own merit, who could dare to utter a word in his presence?\nNow, all miserable, unworthy, and destitute as we are of every\nrecommendation, yet we shall never want an argument or plea for our\nprayers: our confidence can never forsake us; for our Father can never\nbe deprived of his kingdom, power, and glory. The whole is concluded\nwith AMEN; which expresses our ardent desire to obtain the blessings\nsupplicated of God, and confirms our hope that all these things are\nalready obtained, and will certainly be granted to us; because they are\npromised by God, who is incapable of deception. And this agrees with\nthat form of petition already quoted—“Do this, O Lord, for thy name’s\nsake, not for our sake, or for our righteousness;” in which the saints\nnot only express the end of their prayers, but acknowledge that they are\nunworthy to obtain it, unless God derive the cause from himself, and\nthat their confidence of success arises solely from his nature.\nXLVIII. Whatever we ought, or are even at liberty, to seek from God, is\nstated to us in this model and directory for prayer, given by that best\nof masters, Christ, whom the Father has set over us as our Teacher, and\nto whom alone he has enjoined us to listen.[435] For he was always his\neternal wisdom, and being made man, was given to men as the Angel of\ngreat counsel.[436] And this prayer is so comprehensive and complete,\nthat whatever addition is made of any thing extraneous or foreign, not\ncapable of being referred to it, is impious and unworthy of the\napprobation of God. For in this summary he has prescribed what is worthy\nof him, what is acceptable to him, what is necessary for us, and, in a\nword, what he chooses to bestow. Wherefore those who presume to go\nbeyond it, and to ask of God any thing else, in the first place, are\ndetermined to make some addition of their own to the wisdom of God,\nwhich cannot be done without folly and blasphemy; in the next place,\ndespising the limits fixed by the will of God, they are led far astray\nby their own irregular desires; and in the last place, they will never\nobtain any thing, since they pray without faith. And there is no doubt\nthat all prayers of this kind are made without faith, because they are\nnot sanctioned by the word of God, the only basis on which faith can\nstand. But they who neglect the Master’s rule, and indulge their own\ndesires, not only deviate from the word of God, but make all possible\nopposition against it. With equal beauty and truth, therefore,\nTertullian has called this a _legitimate prayer_, tacitly implying, that\nall others are irregular and unlawful.\nXLIX. We would not here be understood, as if we were confined to this\nform of prayer, without the liberty of changing a word or syllable. For\nthe Scriptures contain many prayers, expressed in words very different\nfrom this, yet written by the same Spirit, and very profitable for our\nuse. Many, which have little verbal resemblance to it, are continually\nsuggested to believers by the same Spirit. We only mean by these\nobservations, that no one should even seek, expect, or ask for any thing\nthat is not summarily comprehended in this prayer, though there may be a\ndiversity of expression, without any variation of sense. As it is\ncertain that all the prayers contained in the Scriptures, or proceeding\nfrom pious hearts, are referred to this, so it is impossible to find one\nany where which can surpass or even equal the perfection of this. Here\nis nothing omitted which ought to be recollected for the praises of God,\nnothing that should occur to the mind of man for his own advantage; and\nthe whole is so complete, as justly to inspire universal despair of\nattempting any improvement. To conclude; let us remember, that this is\nthe teaching of Divine wisdom, which taught what it willed, and willed\nwhat is needful.\nL. But though we have before said that we ought to be always aspiring\ntowards God with our minds, and praying without intermission, yet as our\nweakness requires many assistances, and our indolence needs to be\nstimulated, we ought every one of us, for the sake of regularity, to\nappoint particular hours which should not elapse without prayer, and\nwhich should witness all the affections of the mind entirely engaged in\nthis exercise; as, when we rise in the morning, before we enter on the\nbusiness of the day, when we sit down to meat, when we have been fed by\nthe Divine blessing, when we retire to rest. This must not be a\nsuperstitious observance of hours, by which, as if discharging our debt\nto God, we may fancy ourselves discharged from all obligation for the\nremaining hours; but a discipline for our weakness, which may thus, from\ntime to time, be exercised and stimulated. It must especially be the\nobject of our solicitous care, whenever we are oppressed, or see others\noppressed, with adversity, immediately to resort to him with celerity,\nnot of body, but of mind; secondly, to suffer no prosperity of our own\nor others to pass without testifying our acknowledgment of his hand by\npraise and thanksgiving; lastly, we must carefully observe this in every\nprayer, that we entertain not the thought of binding God to certain\ncircumstances, or prescribing to him the time, the place, or the manner\nof his proceedings. As we are taught by this prayer to fix no law, to\nimpose no condition on him, but to leave it to his will to do what he\nintends, in the manner, at the time, and in the place he pleases,\ntherefore, before we form a petition for ourselves, we first pray that\nhis will may be done; thereby submitting our will to his, that, being,\nas it were, bridled and restrained, it may not presume to regulate God,\nbut may constitute him the arbiter and ruler of all its desires.\nLI. If, with minds composed to this obedience, we suffer ourselves to be\ngoverned by the laws of Divine Providence, we shall easily learn to\npersevere in prayer, and with suspended desires to wait patiently for\nthe Lord; assured, though he does not discover himself, yet that he is\nalways near us, and in his own time will declare that his ears have not\nbeen deaf to those prayers which, to human apprehension, seemed to be\nneglected. Now, this, if God do not at any time answer our first\nprayers, will be an immediate consolation, to prevent our sinking into\ndespair, like those who, actuated only by their own ardour, call upon\nGod in such a manner, that if he do not attend to their first\ntransports, and afford them present aid, they at once imagine him to be\ndispleased and angry with them, and, casting away all hope of succeeding\nin their prayers, cease to call upon him. But deferring our hope with a\nwell-tempered equanimity, let us rather practise the perseverance so\nhighly recommended to us in the Scriptures. For in the Psalms we may\nfrequently observe how David and other faithful men, when, almost\nwearied with praying, they seemed to beat the air, and God seemed deaf\nto their petitions, yet did not desist from praying; because the\nauthority of the Divine word is not maintained, unless it be fully\ncredited, notwithstanding the appearance of any circumstances to the\ncontrary. Nor let us tempt God, and provoke him against us by wearying\nhim with our presumption; which is the practice of many who merely\nbargain with God on a certain condition, and as though he were\nsubservient to their passions, bind him with laws of their own\nstipulation; with which unless he immediately complies, they give way to\nanger and fretfulness, to cavils, and murmurs, and rage. To such\npersons, therefore, he frequently grants in his wrath what he denies in\nmercy to others. This is exemplified in the children of Israel, for whom\nit had been better for the Lord not to have heard them, than for them to\nswallow his indignation with the meat that he sent them.[437]\nLII. But if, after long waiting, our sense neither understands what\nadvance we have made by praying, nor experiences any advantage resulting\nfrom it, yet our faith will assure us, what cannot be perceived by\nsense, that we have obtained what was expedient for us, since the Lord\nso frequently and so certainly promises to take care of our troubles\nwhen they have been once deposited in his bosom. And thus he will cause\nus to possess abundance in poverty, and consolation in affliction. For\nthough all things fail us, yet God will never forsake us; he cannot\ndisappoint the expectation and patience of his people. He will amply\ncompensate us for the loss of all others, for he comprehends in himself\nall blessings, which he will reveal to us at the day of judgment, when\nhis kingdom will be fully manifested. Besides, though God grants our\nprayers, he does not always answer them according to the express form of\nthe request; but seeming to keep us in suspense, shows by unknown means\nthat our prayers were not in vain. This is the meaning of these words of\nJohn: “If we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we\nhave the petitions that we desired of him.”[438] This seems to be a\nfeeble superfluity of expression, but is in reality a very useful\ndeclaration, that God, even when he does not comply with our desires, is\nnevertheless favourable and propitious to our prayers, so that a hope\ndepending upon his word can never disappoint us. Now, this patience is\nvery necessary to support believers, who would not long stand unless\nthey relied upon it. For the Lord proves his people with heavy trials,\nand exercises them with severity; frequently driving them to various\nkinds of extremities, and suffering them to remain in them a long time\nbefore he grants them any enjoyment of his grace; and as Hannah says,\n“The Lord killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to the grave, and\nbringeth up.”[439] In such distresses must they not inevitably faint in\ntheir minds, and fall into despair, unless, in the midst of their\naffliction and desolation, and almost death, they were revived by this\nreflection, that God regards them, and that the end of their present\nevils is approaching? But though they rely on the certainty of this\nhope, they at the same time cease not to pray; because, without constant\nperseverance in prayer, we pray to no purpose.\nFootnote 262:\nRom. x. 13, 14, 17.\nFootnote 263:\nRom. viii. 15, 26.\nFootnote 264:\n1 Kings xviii. 42, &c.\nFootnote 265:\nPsalm cxlv. 18.\nFootnote 266:\nPsalm xxxiv. 15.\nFootnote 267:\nPsalm xxv. 1.\nFootnote 268:\nPsalm lxii. 8.\nFootnote 269:\nPsalm cxlv. 19.\nFootnote 270:\n1 John v. 14.\nFootnote 271:\nRom. viii. 26.\nFootnote 272:\nJude 20. 1 Cor. xiv. 15.\nFootnote 273:\nJames v. 13.\nFootnote 274:\nPsalm xxxii. 6.\nFootnote 275:\nEphes. vi. 18.\nFootnote 276:\nIsaiah i. 15.\nFootnote 277:\nJer. xi. 7, 8, 11.\nFootnote 278:\nIsaiah xxix. 13.\nFootnote 279:\nJames iv. 3.\nFootnote 280:\n1 John iii. 22.\nFootnote 281:\nDan. ix. 18, 19.\nFootnote 282:\nDan. ix. 20.\nFootnote 283:\nPsalm cxliii. 2.\nFootnote 284:\nIsaiah lxiv. 5-9.\nFootnote 285:\nJer. xiv. 7.\nFootnote 286:\nBaruch ii. 18.\nFootnote 287:\nPsalm xxv. 7, 18.\nFootnote 288:\nPsalm li. 5.\nFootnote 289:\nMatt. ix. 2.\nFootnote 290:\n1 John i. 9.\nFootnote 291:\nPsalm lxxxvi. 2.\nFootnote 292:\n2 Kings xx. 3.\nFootnote 293:\nPsalm xxxiv. 15.\nFootnote 294:\n1 John iii. 22.\nFootnote 295:\nJohn ix. 31.\nFootnote 296:\nPsalm v. 7.\nFootnote 297:\nMark xi. 24.\nFootnote 298:\nMatt. xxi. 22.\nFootnote 299:\nJames i. 5, 6.\nFootnote 300:\nJames v. 15.\nFootnote 301:\nRom. x. 14, 17.\nFootnote 302:\nHeb. iv. 16.\nFootnote 303:\nEphes. iii. 12.\nFootnote 304:\nPsalm xxxiii. 22.\nFootnote 305:\nPsalm lvi. 9.\nFootnote 306:\nPsalm v. 3.\nFootnote 307:\nEphes. vi. 16, 18.\nFootnote 308:\nPsalm xli. 4.\nFootnote 309:\nPsalm l. 15.\nFootnote 310:\nMatt. vii. 7.\nFootnote 311:\nZech. xiii. 9.\nFootnote 312:\nPsalm lxv. 2.\nFootnote 313:\nPsalm l. 15.\nFootnote 314:\n2 Sam. vii. 27.\nFootnote 315:\nPsalm cxlv. 19.\nFootnote 316:\nProv. xviii. 10.\nFootnote 317:\nJoel ii. 32.\nFootnote 318:\nIsaiah lxv. 24.\nFootnote 319:\nPsalm xci. 15.\nFootnote 320:\nPsalm cxlv. 18.\nFootnote 321:\n2 Sam. vii. 27, 28.\nFootnote 322:\nPsalm cxix. 76.\nFootnote 323:\nGen. xxxii. 10, &c.\nFootnote 324:\nJer. xlii. 9.

          "content": "ETERNAL ELECTION, OR GOD’S PREDESTINATION OF SOME TO SALVATION, AND OF\nOTHERS TO DESTRUCTION.\nThe covenant of life not being equally preached to all, and among those\nto whom it is preached not always finding the same reception, this\ndiversity discovers the wonderful depth of the Divine judgment. Nor is\nit to be doubted that this variety also follows, subject to the decision\nof God’s eternal election. If it be evidently the result of the Divine\nwill, that salvation is freely offered to some, and others are prevented\nfrom attaining it,—this immediately gives rise to important and\ndifficult questions, which are incapable of any other explication, than\nby the establishment of pious minds in what ought to be received\nconcerning election and predestination—a question, in the opinion of\nmany, full of perplexity; for they consider nothing more unreasonable,\nthan that, of the common mass of mankind, some should be predestinated\nto salvation, and others to destruction. But how unreasonably they\nperplex themselves will afterwards appear from the sequel of our\ndiscourse. Besides, the very obscurity which excites such dread, not\nonly displays the utility of this doctrine, but shows it to be\nproductive of the most delightful benefit. We shall never be clearly\nconvinced as we ought to be, that our salvation flows from the fountain\nof God’s free mercy, till we are acquainted with his eternal election,\nwhich illustrates the grace of God by this comparison, that he adopts\nnot all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what\nhe refuses to others. Ignorance of this principle evidently detracts\nfrom the Divine glory, and diminishes real humility. But according to\nPaul, what is so necessary to be known, never can be known, unless God,\nwithout any regard to works, chooses those whom he has decreed. “At this\npresent time also, there is a remnant according to the election of\ngrace. And if by grace, then it is no more of works; otherwise, grace is\nno more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace;\notherwise, work is no more work.”[440] If we need to be recalled to the\norigin of election, to prove that we obtain salvation from no other\nsource than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this\nprinciple, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and\nloudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing\nthe salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace,\nPaul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom\nhe will of his mere good pleasure, and does not dispense a reward to\nwhich there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent any one\nfrom presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to\nman than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us\nsuitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great\nobligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence,\neven according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all\nfear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and\ndeadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has\ncommitted to his care. Whence we infer, that they who know not\nthemselves to be God’s peculiar people will be tortured with continual\nanxiety; and therefore, that the interest of all believers, as well as\ntheir own, is very badly consulted by those who, blind to the three\nadvantages we have remarked, would wholly remove the foundation of our\nsalvation. And hence the Church rises to our view, which otherwise, as\nBernard justly observes, could neither be discovered nor recognized\namong creatures, being in two respects wonderfully concealed in the\nbosom of a blessed predestination, and in the mass of a miserable\ndamnation. But before I enter on the subject itself, I must address some\npreliminary observations to two sorts of persons. The discussion of\npredestination—a subject of itself rather intricate—is made very\nperplexed, and therefore dangerous, by human curiosity, which no\nbarriers can restrain from wandering into forbidden labyrinths, and\nsoaring beyond its sphere, as if determined to leave none of the Divine\nsecrets unscrutinized or unexplored. As we see multitudes every where\nguilty of this arrogance and presumption, and among them some who are\nnot censurable in other respects, it is proper to admonish them of the\nbounds of their duty on this subject. First, then, let them remember\nthat when they inquire into predestination, they penetrate the inmost\nrecesses of Divine wisdom, where the careless and confident intruder\nwill obtain no satisfaction to his curiosity, but will enter a labyrinth\nfrom which he will find no way to depart. For it is unreasonable that\nman should scrutinize with impunity those things which the Lord has\ndetermined to be hidden in himself; and investigate, even from eternity,\nthat sublimity of wisdom which God would have us to adore and not\ncomprehend, to promote our admiration of his glory. The secrets of his\nwill which he determined to reveal to us, he discovers in his word; and\nthese are all that he foresaw would concern us or conduce to our\nadvantage.\nII. “We are come into the way of faith,” says Augustine; “let us\nconstantly pursue it. It conducts into the king’s palace, in which are\nhidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. For the Lord Christ\nhimself envied not his great and most select disciples when he said, ‘I\nhave many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.’ We must\nwalk, we must improve, we must grow, that our hearts may be able to\nunderstand those things of which we are at present incapable. If the\nlast day finds us improving, we shall then learn what we never could\nlearn in the present state.” If we only consider that the word of the\nLord is the only way to lead us to an investigation of all that ought to\nbe believed concerning him, and the only light to enlighten us to behold\nall that ought to be seen of him, this consideration will easily\nrestrain and preserve us from all presumption. For we shall know that\nwhen we have exceeded the limits of the word, we shall get into a\ndevious and darksome course, in which errors, slips, and falls, will\noften be inevitable. Let us, then, in the first place, bear in mind,\nthat to desire any other knowledge of predestination than what is\nunfolded in the word of God, indicates as great folly, as a wish to walk\nthrough unpassable roads, or to see in the dark. Nor let us be ashamed\nto be ignorant of some things relative to a subject in which there is a\nkind of learned ignorance. Rather let us abstain with cheerfulness from\nthe pursuit of that knowledge, the affectation of which is foolish,\ndangerous, and even fatal. But if we are stimulated by the wantonness of\nintellect, we must oppose it with a reflection calculated to repress it,\nthat as “it is not good to eat much honey, so for men to search their\nown glory, is not glory.”[441] For there is sufficient to deter us from\nthat presumption, which can only precipitate us into ruin.\nIII. Others, desirous of remedying this evil, will have all mention of\npredestination to be as it were buried; they teach men to avoid every\nquestion concerning it as they would a precipice. Though their\nmoderation is to be commended, in judging that mysteries ought to be\nhandled with such great sobriety, yet, as they descend too low, they\nhave little influence on the mind of man, which refuses to submit to\nunreasonable restraints. To observe, therefore, the legitimate boundary\non this side also, we must recur to the word of the Lord, which affords\na certain rule for the understanding. For the Scripture is the school of\nthe Holy Spirit, in which, as nothing necessary and useful to be known\nis omitted, so nothing is taught which it is not beneficial to know.\nWhatever, therefore, is declared in the Scripture concerning\npredestination, we must be cautious not to withhold from believers, lest\nwe appear either to defraud them of the favor of their God, or to\nreprove and censure the Holy Spirit for publishing what it would be\nuseful by any means to suppress. Let us, I say, permit the Christian man\nto open his heart and his ears to all the discourses addressed to him by\nGod, only with this moderation, that as soon as the Lord closes his\nsacred mouth, he shall also desist from further inquiry. This will be\nthe best barrier of sobriety, if in learning we not only follow the\nleadings of God, but as soon as he ceases to teach, we give up our\ndesire of learning. Nor is the danger they dread, sufficient to divert\nour attention from the oracles of God. It is a celebrated observation of\nSolomon, that “it is the glory of God to conceal a thing.”[442] But, as\nboth piety and common sense suggest that this is not to be understood\ngenerally of every thing, we must seek for the proper distinction, lest\nwe content ourselves with brutish ignorance under the pretext of modesty\nand sobriety. Now, this distinction is clearly expressed in a few words\nby Moses. “The secret things,” he says, “belong unto the Lord our God;\nbut those things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our children\nfor ever, that we may do all the words of this law.”[443] For we see how\nhe enforces on the people attention to the doctrine of the law only by\nthe celestial decree, because it pleased God to promulgate it; and\nrestrains the same people within those limits with this single reason,\nthat it is not lawful for mortals to intrude into the secrets of God.\nIV. Profane persons, I confess, suddenly lay hold of something relating\nto the subject of predestination, to furnish occasion for objections,\ncavils, reproaches, and ridicule. But if we are frightened from it by\ntheir impudence, all the principal articles of the faith must be\nconcealed, for there is scarcely one of them which such persons as these\nleave unviolated by blasphemy. The refractory mind will discover as much\ninsolence, on hearing that there are three persons in the Divine\nessence, as on being told, that when God created man, he foresaw what\nwould happen concerning him. Nor will they refrain from derision on\nbeing informed, that little more than five thousand years have elapsed\nsince the creation of the world. They will ask why the power of God was\nso long idle and asleep. Nothing can be advanced which they will not\nendeavour to ridicule. Must we, in order to check these sacrileges, say\nnothing of the Divinity of the Son and Spirit, or pass over in silence\nthe creation of the world? In this instance, and every other, the truth\nof God is too powerful to dread the detraction of impious men; as is\nstrenuously maintained by Augustine, in his treatise on the Perseverance\nof the Faithful. We see the false apostles, with all their defamation\nand accusation of the true doctrine of Paul, could never succeed to make\nhim ashamed of it. Their assertion, that all this discussion is\ndangerous to pious minds, because it is inconsistent with exhortations,\nshakes their faith, and disturbs and discourages the heart itself, is\nwithout any foundation. Augustine admits, that he was frequently blamed,\non these accounts, for preaching predestination too freely; but he\nreadily and amply refutes them. But as many and various absurdities are\ncrowded upon us here, we prefer reserving every one to be refuted in its\nproper place. I only desire this general admission, that we should\nneither scrutinize those things which the Lord has left concealed, nor\nneglect those which he has openly exhibited, lest we be condemned for\nexcessive curiosity on the one hand, or for ingratitude on the other.\nFor it is judiciously remarked by Augustine, that we may safely follow\nthe Scripture, which proceeds as with the pace of a mother stooping to\nthe weakness of a child, that it may not leave our weak capacities\nbehind. But persons who are so cautious or timid, as to wish\npredestination to be buried in silence, lest feeble minds should be\ndisturbed,—with what pretext, I ask, will they gloss over their\narrogance, which indirectly charges God with foolish inadvertency, as\nthough he foresaw not the danger which they suppose they have had the\npenetration to discover. Whoever, therefore, endeavours to raise\nprejudices against the doctrine of predestination, openly reproaches\nGod, as though something had inconsiderately escaped from him that is\npernicious to the Church.\nV. Predestination, by which God adopts some to the hope of life, and\nadjudges others to eternal death, no one, desirous of the credit of\npiety, dares absolutely to deny. But it is involved in many cavils,\nespecially by those who make foreknowledge the cause of it. We maintain,\nthat both belong to God; but it is preposterous to represent one as\ndependent on the other. When we attribute foreknowledge to God, we mean\nthat all things have ever been, and perpetually remain, before his eyes,\nso that to his knowledge nothing is future or past, but all things are\npresent; and present in such a manner, that he does not merely conceive\nof them from ideas formed in his mind, as things remembered by us appear\npresent to our minds, but really beholds and sees them as if actually\nplaced before him. And this foreknowledge extends to the whole world,\nand to all the creatures. Predestination we call the eternal decree of\nGod, by which he has determined in himself, what he would have to become\nof every individual of mankind. For they are not all created with a\nsimilar destiny; but eternal life is fore-ordained for some, and eternal\ndamnation for others. Every man, therefore, being created for one or the\nother of these ends, we say, he is predestinated either to life or to\ndeath. This God has not only testified in particular persons, but has\ngiven a specimen of it in the whole posterity of Abraham, which should\nevidently show the future condition of every nation to depend upon his\ndecision. “When the Most High divided the nations, when he separated the\nsons of Adam, the Lord’s portion was his people; Jacob was the lot of\nhis inheritance.”[444] The separation is before the eyes of all: in the\nperson of Abraham, as in the dry trunk of a tree, one people is\npeculiarly chosen to the rejection of others: no reason for this\nappears, except that Moses, to deprive their posterity of all occasion\nof glorying, teaches them that their exaltation is wholly from God’s\ngratuitous love. He assigns this reason for their deliverance, that “he\nloved their fathers, and chose their seed after them.”[445] More fully\nin another chapter: “The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose\nyou, because you were more in number than any people; but because the\nLord loved you.”[446] He frequently repeats the same admonition:\n“Behold, the heaven is the Lord’s thy God, the earth also, with all that\ntherein is. Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and\nhe chose their seed after them.”[447] In another place, sanctification\nis enjoined upon them, because they were chosen to be a peculiar\npeople.[448] And again, elsewhere, love is asserted to be the cause of\ntheir protection. It is declared by the united voice of the faithful,\n“He hath chosen our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob, whom he\nloved.”[449] For the gifts conferred on them by God, they all ascribe to\ngratuitous love, not only from a consciousness that these were not\nobtained by any merit of theirs, but from a conviction, that the holy\npatriarch himself was not endued with such excellence as to acquire the\nprivilege of so great an honour for himself and his posterity. And the\nmore effectually to demolish all pride, he reproaches them with having\ndeserved no favour, being “a stiff-necked and rebellious people.”[450]\nThe prophets also frequently reproach the Jews with the unwelcome\nmention of this election, because they had shamefully departed from it.\nLet them, however, now come forward, who wish to restrict the election\nof God to the desert of men, or the merit of works. When they see one\nnation preferred to all others,—when they hear that God had no\ninducement to be more favourable to a few, and ignoble, and even\ndisobedient and obstinate people,—will they quarrel with him because he\nhas chosen to give such an example of mercy? But their obstreperous\nclamours will not impede his work, nor will the reproaches they hurl\nagainst Heaven, injure or affect his justice; they will rather recoil\nupon their own heads. To this principle of the gracious covenant, the\nIsraelites are also recalled whenever thanks are to be rendered to God,\nor their hopes are to be raised for futurity. “He hath made us, and not\nwe ourselves,” says the Psalmist: “we are his people, and the sheep of\nhis pasture.”[451] It is not without reason that the negation is added,\n“not we ourselves,” that they may know that of all the benefits they\nenjoy, God is not only the Author, but derived the cause from himself,\nthere being nothing in them deserving of such great honour. He also\nenjoins them to be content with the mere good pleasure of God, in these\nwords: “O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his\nchosen.” And after having recounted the continual benefits bestowed by\nGod as fruits of election, he at length concludes that he had acted with\nsuch liberality, “because he remembered his covenant.”[452] Consistent\nwith this doctrine is the song of the whole Church: “Thy right hand, and\nthine arm, and the light of thy countenance, gave our fathers the land,\nbecause thou hadst a favour unto them.”[453] It must be observed that\nwhere mention is made of the land, it is a visible symbol of the secret\nseparation, which comprehends adoption. David, in another place, exhorts\nthe people to the same gratitude: “Blessed is the nation whose God is\nthe Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own\ninheritance.”[454] Samuel animates to a good hope: “The Lord will not\nforsake his people, for his great name’s sake; because it hath pleased\nthe Lord to make you his people.”[455] David, when his faith is\nassailed, thus arms himself for the conflict: “Blessed is the man whom\nthou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee; he shall dwell in thy\ncourts.”[456] But since the election hidden in God has been confirmed by\nthe first deliverance, as well as by the second and other intermediate\nblessings, the word _choose_ is transferred to it in Isaiah: “The Lord\nwill have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel;”[457] because,\ncontemplating a future period, he declares that the collection of the\nresidue of the people, whom he had appeared to have forsaken, would be a\nsign of the stable and sure election, which had likewise seemed to fail.\nWhen he says also, in another place, “I have chosen thee, and not cast\nthee away,”[458] he commends the continual course of his signal\nliberality and paternal benevolence. The angel, in Zechariah, speaks\nmore plainly: “The Lord shall choose Jerusalem again;”[459] as though\nhis severe chastisement had been a rejection, or their exile had been an\ninterruption of election; which, nevertheless, remains inviolable,\nthough the tokens of it are not always visible.\nVI. We must now proceed to a second degree of election, still more\nrestricted, or that in which the Divine grace was displayed in a more\nspecial manner, when of the same race of Abraham God rejected some, and\nby nourishing others in the Church, proved that he retained them among\nhis children. Ishmael at first obtained the same station as his brother\nIsaac, for the spiritual covenant was equally sealed in him by the\nsymbol of circumcision. He is cut off; afterwards Esau; lastly, an\ninnumerable multitude, and almost all Israel. In Isaac the seed was\ncalled; the same calling continued in Jacob. God exhibited a similar\nexample in the rejection of Saul, which is magnificently celebrated by\nthe Psalmist: “He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the\ntribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah;”[460] and this the\nsacred history frequently repeats, that the wonderful secret of Divine\ngrace may be more manifest in that change. I grant, it was by their own\ncrime and guilt that Ishmael, Esau, and persons of similar characters,\nfell from the adoption; because the condition annexed was, that they\nshould faithfully keep the covenant of God, which they perfidiously\nviolated. Yet it was a peculiar favour of God, that he deigned to prefer\nthem to other nations; as it is said in the Psalms: “He hath not dealt\nso with any nation; and as for his judgments, they have not known\nthem.”[461] But I have justly said that here are two degrees to be\nremarked; for in the election of the whole nation, God has already shown\nthat in his mere goodness he is bound by no laws, but is perfectly free,\nso that none can require of him an equal distribution of grace, the\ninequality of which demonstrates it to be truly gratuitous. Therefore\nMalachi aggravates the ingratitude of Israel, because, though not only\nelected out of the whole race of mankind, but also separated from a\nsacred family to be a peculiar people, they perfidiously and impiously\ndespised God their most beneficent Father. “Was not Esau Jacob’s\nbrother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau.”[462] For\nGod takes it for granted, since both were sons of a holy father,\nsuccessors of the covenant, and branches from a sacred root, that the\nchildren of Jacob were already laid under more than common obligations\nby their admission to that honour; but Esau the first-born having been\nrejected, and their father, though inferior by birth, having been made\nthe heir, he proves them guilty of double ingratitude, and complains of\ntheir violating this twofold claim.\nVII. Though it is sufficiently clear, that God, in his secret counsel,\nfreely chooses whom he will, and rejects others, his gratuitous election\nis but half displayed till we come to particular individuals, to whom\nGod not only offers salvation, but assigns it in such a manner, that the\ncertainty of the effect is liable to no suspense or doubt. These are\nincluded in that one seed mentioned by Paul; for though the adoption was\ndeposited in the hand of Abraham, yet many of his posterity being cut\noff as putrid members, in order to maintain the efficacy and stability\nof election, it is necessary to ascend to the head, in whom their\nheavenly Father has bound his elect to each other, and united them to\nhimself by an indissoluble bond. Thus the adoption of the family of\nAbraham displayed the favour of God, which he denied to others; but in\nthe members of Christ there is a conspicuous exhibition of the superior\nefficacy of grace; because, being united to their head, they never fail\nof salvation. Paul, therefore, justly reasons from the passage of\nMalachi which I have just quoted, that where God, introducing the\ncovenant of eternal life, invites any people to himself, there is a\npeculiar kind of election as to part of them, so that he does not\nefficaciously choose all with indiscriminate grace. The declaration,\n“Jacob have I loved,” respects the whole posterity of the patriarch,\nwhom the prophet there opposes to the descendants of Esau. Yet this is\nno objection to our having in the person of one individual a specimen of\nthe election, which can never fail of attaining its full effect. These,\nwho truly belong to Christ, Paul correctly observes, are called “a\nremnant;” for experience proves, that of a great multitude the most part\nfall away and disappear, so that often only a small portion remains.\nThat the general election of a people is not always effectual and\npermanent, a reason readily presents itself, because, when God covenants\nwith them, he does not also give them the spirit of regeneration to\nenable them to persevere in the covenant to the end; but the external\ncall, without the internal efficacy of grace, which would be sufficient\nfor their preservation, is a kind of medium between the rejection of all\nmankind and the election of the small number of believers. The whole\nnation of Israel was called “God’s inheritance,” though many of them\nwere strangers; but God, having firmly covenanted to be their Father and\nRedeemer, regards that gratuitous favour rather than the defection of\nmultitudes; by whom his truth was not violated, because his preservation\nof a certain remnant to himself, made it evident that his calling was\nwithout repentance. For God’s collection of a Church for himself, from\ntime to time, from the children of Abraham, rather than from the profane\nnations, was in consideration of his covenant, which, being violated by\nthe multitude, he restricted to a few, to prevent its total failure.\nLastly, the general adoption of the seed of Abraham was a visible\nrepresentation of a greater blessing, which God conferred on a few out\nof the multitude. This is the reason that Paul so carefully\ndistinguishes the descendants of Abraham according to the flesh, from\nhis spiritual children called after the example of Isaac. Not that the\nmere descent from Abraham was a vain and unprofitable thing, which could\nnot be asserted without depreciating the covenant; but because to the\nlatter alone the immutable counsel of God, in which he predestinated\nwhom he would, was of itself effectual to salvation. But I advise my\nreaders to adopt no prejudice on either side, till it shall appear from\nadduced passages of Scripture what sentiments ought to be entertained.\nIn conformity, therefore, to the clear doctrine of the Scripture, we\nassert, that by an eternal and immutable counsel, God has once for all\ndetermined, both whom he would admit to salvation, and whom he would\ncondemn to destruction. We affirm that this counsel, as far as concerns\nthe elect, is founded on his gratuitous mercy, totally irrespective of\nhuman merit; but that to those whom he devotes to condemnation, the gate\nof life is closed by a just and irreprehensible, but incomprehensible,\njudgment. In the elect, we consider calling as an evidence of election,\nand justification as another token of its manifestation, till they\narrive in glory, which constitutes its completion. As God seals his\nelect by vocation and justification, so by excluding the reprobate from\nthe knowledge of his name and the sanctification of his Spirit, he\naffords an indication of the judgment that awaits them. Here I shall\npass over many fictions fabricated by foolish men to overthrow\npredestination. It is unnecessary to refute things which, as soon as\nthey are advanced, sufficiently prove their own falsehood. I shall dwell\nonly on those things which are subjects of controversy among the\nlearned, or which may occasion difficulty to simple minds, or which\nimpiety speciously pleads in order to stigmatize the Divine justice.\nFootnote 440:\nRom. xi. 5, 6.\nFootnote 441:\nProv. xxv. 27.\nFootnote 442:\nProv. xxv. 2.\nFootnote 443:\nDeut. xxix. 29.\nFootnote 444:\nDeut. xxxii. 8, 9.\nFootnote 445:\nDeut. iv. 37.\nFootnote 446:\nDeut. vii. 7, 8.\nFootnote 447:\nDeut. x. 14, 15.\nFootnote 448:\nDeut. xxiii.\nFootnote 449:\nPsalm xlvii. 4.\nFootnote 450:\nDeut. ix. 6, 7.\nFootnote 451:\nPsalm c. 3.\nFootnote 452:\nPsalm cv. 6, 8.\nFootnote 453:\nPsalm xliv. 3.\nFootnote 454:\nPsalm xxxiii. 12.\nFootnote 455:\n1 Sam. xii. 22.\nFootnote 456:\nPsalm lxv. 4.\nFootnote 457:\nIsaiah xiv. 1.\nFootnote 458:\nIsaiah xli. 9.\nFootnote 459:\nZech. ii. 12.\nFootnote 460:\nPsalm lxxviii. 67, 68.\nFootnote 461:\nPsalm cxlvii. 20.\nFootnote 462:\nMal. i. 2, 3."

          "title": "CHAPTER XXII.",
          "content": "TESTIMONIES OF SCRIPTURE IN CONFIRMATION OF THIS DOCTRINE.\nAll the positions we have advanced are controverted by many, especially\nthe gratuitous election of believers, which nevertheless cannot be\nshaken. It is a notion commonly entertained, that God, foreseeing what\nwould be the respective merits of every individual, makes a\ncorrespondent distinction between different persons; that he adopts as\nhis children such as he foreknows will be deserving of his grace, and\ndevotes to the damnation of death others, whose dispositions he sees\nwill be inclined to wickedness and impiety. Thus they not only obscure\nelection by covering it with the veil of foreknowledge, but pretend that\nit originates in another cause. Nor is this commonly received notion the\nopinion of the vulgar only, for it has had great advocates in all ages;\nwhich I candidly confess, that no one may cherish a confidence of\ninjuring our cause by opposing us with their names. For the truth of God\non this point is too certain to be shaken, too clear to be overthrown by\nthe authority of men. Others, neither acquainted with the Scripture, nor\ndeserving of any attention, oppose the sound doctrine with extreme\npresumption and intolerable effrontery. God’s sovereign election of\nsome, and preterition of others, they make the subject of formal\naccusation against him. But if this is the known fact, what will they\ngain by quarrelling with God? We teach nothing but what experience has\nproved, that God has always been at liberty to bestow his grace on whom\nhe chooses. I will not inquire how the posterity of Abraham excelled\nother nations, unless it was by that favour, the cause of which can only\nbe found in God. Let them answer why they are men, and not oxen or\nasses: when it was in God’s power to create them dogs, he formed them\nafter his own image. Will they allow the brute animals to expostulate\nwith God respecting their condition, as though the distinction were\nunjust? Their enjoyment of a privilege which they have acquired by no\nmerits, is certainly no more reasonable than God’s various distribution\nof his favours according to the measure of his judgment. If they make a\ntransition to persons where the inequality is more offensive to them,\nthe example of Christ at least ought to deter them from carelessly\nprating concerning this sublime mystery. A mortal man is conceived of\nthe seed of David: to the merit of what virtues will they ascribe his\nbeing made, even in the womb, the Head of angels, the only begotten Son\nof God, the Image and Glory of the Father, the Light, Righteousness, and\nSalvation of the world? It is judiciously remarked by Augustine, that\nthere is the brightest example of gratuitous election in the Head of the\nChurch himself, that it may not perplex us in the members; that he did\nnot become the Son of God by leading a righteous life, but was\ngratuitously invested with this high honour, that he might afterwards\nrender others partakers of the gifts bestowed upon him. If any one\ninquire, why others are not all that he was, or why we are all at such a\nvast distance from him,—why we are all corrupt, and he purity itself,—he\nwill betray both folly and impudence. But if they persist in the wish to\ndeprive God of the uncontrollable right of choosing and rejecting, let\nthem also take away what is given to Christ. Now, it is of importance to\nattend to what the Scripture declares respecting every individual.\nPaul’s assertion, that we were “chosen in Christ before the foundation\nof the world,”[463] certainly precludes any consideration of merit in\nus; for it is as though he had said, our heavenly Father, finding\nnothing worthy of his choice in all the posterity of Adam, turned his\nviews towards his Christ, to choose members from his body whom he would\nadmit to the fellowship of life. Let believers, then, be satisfied with\nthis reason, that we were adopted in Christ to the heavenly inheritance,\nbecause in ourselves we were incapable of such high dignity. He has a\nsimilar remark in another place, where he exhorts the Colossians to\n“give thanks unto the Father, who had made them meet to be partakers of\nthe inheritance of the saints.”[464] If election precedes this grace of\nGod, which makes us meet to obtain the glory of the life to come, what\nwill God find in us to induce him to elect us? Another passage from this\napostle will still more clearly express my meaning. “He hath chosen us,”\nhe says, “before the foundation of the world, according to the good\npleasure of his will, that we should be holy, and without blame before\nhim;”[465] where he opposes the good pleasure of God to all our merits\nwhatsoever.\nII. To render the proof more complete, it will be useful to notice all\nthe clauses of that passage, which, taken in connection, leave no room\nfor doubt. By the appellation of the _elect_, or _chosen_, he certainly\ndesignates believers, as he soon after declares: wherefore it is\ncorrupting the term by a shameful fiction to restrict it to the age in\nwhich the gospel was published. By saying that they were elected before\nthe creation of the world, he precludes every consideration of merit.\nFor what could be the reason for discrimination between those who yet\nhad no existence, and whose condition was afterward to be the same in\nAdam? Now, if they are chosen in Christ, it follows, not only that each\nindividual is chosen out of himself, but also that some are separated\nfrom others; for it is evident, that all are not members of Christ. The\nnext clause, stating them to have been “chosen that they might be holy,”\nfully refutes the error which derives election from foreknowledge; since\nPaul, on the contrary, declares that all the virtue discovered in men is\nthe effect of election. If any inquiry be made after a superior cause,\nPaul replies, that God thus “predestinated,” and that it was “according\nto the good pleasure of his will.” This overturns any means of election\nwhich men imagine in themselves; for all the benefits conferred by God\nfor the spiritual life, he represents as flowing from this one source,\nthat God elected whom he would, and, before they were born, laid up in\nreserve for them the grace with which he determined to favor them.\nIII. Wherever this decree of God reigns, there can be no consideration\nof any works. The antithesis, indeed, is not pursued here; but it must\nbe understood, as it is amplified by the same writer in another place:\n“Who hath called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but\naccording to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ\nJesus, before the world began.”[466] And we have already shown that the\nfollowing clause, “that we should be holy,” removes every difficulty.\nFor say, Because he foresaw they would be holy, therefore he chose them,\nand you will invert the order of Paul. We may safely infer, then, If he\nchose us that we should be holy, his foresight of our future holiness\nwas not the cause of his choice. For these two propositions, That the\nholiness of believers is the fruit of election, and, That they attain it\nby means of works, are incompatible with each other. Nor is there any\nforce in the cavil to which they frequently resort, that the grace of\nelection was not God’s reward of antecedent works, but his gift to\nfuture ones. For when it is said, that believers were elected that they\nshould be holy, it is fully implied, that the holiness they were in\nfuture to possess had its origin in election. And what consistency would\nthere be in asserting, that things derived from election were the causes\nof election? A subsequent clause seems further to confirm what he had\nsaid—“according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in\nhimself.”[467] For the assertion, that God purposed in himself, is\nequivalent to saying, that he considered nothing out of himself, with\nany view to influence his determination. Therefore he immediately\nsubjoins, that the great and only object of our election is, “that we\nshould be to the praise of” Divine “grace.” Certainly the grace of God\ndeserves not the sole praise of our election, unless this election be\ngratuitous. Now, it could not be gratuitous, if, in choosing his people,\nGod himself considered what would be the nature of their respective\nworks. The declaration of Christ to his disciples, therefore, is\nuniversally applicable to all believers: “Ye have not chosen me, but I\nhave chosen you;”[468] which not only excludes past merits, but\nsignifies that they had nothing in themselves to cause their election,\nindependently of his preventing mercy. This also is the meaning of that\npassage of Paul, “Who hath first given to him, and it shall be\nrecompensed unto him again?”[469] For his design is to show, that God’s\ngoodness altogether anticipates men, finding nothing in them, either\npast or future, to conciliate his favour towards them.\nIV. In the Epistle to the Romans, where he goes to the bottom of this\nargument, and pursues it more at length, he says, “They are not all\nIsrael which are” born “of Israel;”[470] because though all were blessed\nby hereditary right, yet the succession did not pass to all alike. This\ncontroversy originated in the pride and vain-glorying of the Jewish\npeople, who, claiming for themselves the title of the Church, would make\nthe faith of the gospel to depend on their decision; just as, in the\npresent day, the Papists with this false pretext would substitute\nthemselves in the place of God. Paul, though he admits the posterity of\nAbraham to be holy in consequence of the covenant, yet contends that\nmost of them are strangers to it; and that not only because they\ndegenerate, from legitimate children becoming spurious ones, but because\nthe preëminence and sovereignty belong to God’s special election, which\nis the sole foundation of the validity of their adoption. If some were\nestablished in the hope of salvation by their own piety, and the\nrejection of others were owing wholly to their own defection, Paul’s\nreference of his readers to the secret election would indeed be weak and\nabsurd. Now, if the will of God, of which no cause appears or must be\nsought out of himself, discriminates some from others, so that the\nchildren of Israel are not all true Israelites, it is in vain pretended\nthat the condition of every individual originates with himself. He\npursues the subject further under the example of Jacob and Esau; for\nbeing both children of Abraham, and both enclosed in their mother’s\nwomb, the transfer of the honour of primogeniture to Jacob was by a\npreternatural change, which Paul, however, contends indicated the\nelection of the one and the reprobation of the other. The origin and the\ncause are inquired, which the champions of foreknowledge maintain to be\nexhibited in the virtues and the vices of men. For this is their short\nand easy doctrine—That God has showed in the person of Jacob, that he\nelects such as are worthy of his grace; and in the person of Esau, that\nhe rejects those whom he foresees to be unworthy. This, indeed, they\nassert with confidence; but what is the testimony of Paul? “The children\nbeing not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the\npurpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of\nhim that calleth, it was said, The elder shall serve the younger; as it\nis written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”[471] If this\ndistinction between the brothers was influenced by foreknowledge, the\nmention of the time must certainly be unnecessary. On the supposition\nthat Jacob was elected, because that honour was acquired by his future\nvirtues, to what purpose could Paul remark that he was not yet born? It\nwould not have been so proper to add, that he had not yet done any good;\nfor it will be immediately replied, that nothing is concealed from God,\nand therefore the piety of Jacob must have been present before him. If\ngrace be the reward of works, they ought to have had their just value\nattributed to them before Jacob was born, as much as if he were already\ngrown to maturity. But the apostle proceeds in unravelling the\ndifficulty, and teaches that the adoption of Jacob flowed not from\nworks, but from the calling of God. In speaking of works, he introduces\nno time, future or past, but positively opposes them to the calling of\nGod, intending the establishment of the one, and the absolute subversion\nof the other; as though he had said, We must consider the good pleasure\nof God, and not the productions of men. Lastly, the very terms,\n_election_ and _purpose_, certainly exclude from this subject all the\ncauses frequently invented by men, independently of God’s secret\ncounsel.\nV. Now, what pretexts will be urged to obscure these arguments, by those\nwho attribute to works, either past or future, any influence on\nelection? For this is nothing but an evasion of the apostle’s argument,\nthat the distinction between the two brothers depends not on any\nconsideration of works, but on the mere calling of God, because it was\nfixed between them when they were not yet born. Nor would their subtilty\nhave escaped him, if there had been any solidity in it; but well knowing\nthe impossibility of God’s foreseeing any good in man, except what he\nhad first determined to bestow by the benefit of his election, he\nresorts not to the preposterous order of placing good works before their\ncause. We have the apostle’s authority that the salvation of believers\nis founded solely on the decision of Divine election, and that that\nfavour is not procured by works, but proceeds from gratuitous calling.\nWe have also a lively exhibition of this truth in a particular example.\nJacob and Esau are brothers, begotten of the same parents, still\nenclosed in the same womb, not yet brought forth into light; there is in\nall respects a perfect equality between them; yet the judgment of God\nconcerning them is different. For he takes one, and rejects the other.\nThe primogeniture was the only thing that gave one a right of priority\nto the other. But that also is passed by, and on the younger is bestowed\nwhat is refused to the elder. In other instances, also, God appears\nalways to have treated primogeniture with designed and decided contempt,\nto cut off from the flesh all occasion of boasting. He rejects Ishmael,\nand favours Isaac. He degrades Manasseh, and honours Ephraim.\nVI. If it be objected, that from these inferior and inconsiderable\nbenefits, it must not be concluded respecting the life to come, that he\nwho has been raised to the honour of primogeniture is therefore to be\nconsidered as adopted to the inheritance of heaven,—for there are many\nwho spare not Paul, as though in his citation of Scripture testimonies\nhe had perverted them from their genuine meaning,—I answer as before,\nthat the apostle has neither erred through inadvertency, nor wilfully\nperverted testimonies of Scripture. But he saw, what they cannot bear to\nconsider, that God intended by an earthly symbol to declare the\nspiritual election of Jacob, which otherwise lay concealed behind his\ninaccessible tribunal. For unless the primogeniture granted him had\nreference to the future world, it was a vain and ridiculous kind of\nblessing, which produced him nothing but various afflictions and\nadversities, grievous exile, numerous cares, and bitter sorrows.\nDiscerning, beyond all doubt, that God’s external blessing was an\nindication of the spiritual and permanent blessing he had prepared for\nhis servant in his kingdom, Paul hesitated not to argue from the former\nin proof of the latter. It must also be remembered, that to the land of\nCanaan was annexed the pledge of the celestial residence; so that it\nought not to be doubted that Jacob was ingrafted with angels into the\nbody of Christ, that he might be a partaker of the same life. While Esau\nis rejected, therefore, Jacob is elected, and distinguished from him by\nGod’s predestination, without any difference of merit. If you inquire\nthe cause, the apostle assigns the following: “For he saith to Moses, I\nwill have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on\nwhom I will have compassion.”[472] And what is this but a plain\ndeclaration of the Lord, that he finds no cause in men to induce him to\nshow favour to them, but derives it solely from his own mercy; and\ntherefore that the salvation of his people is his work? When God fixes\nyour salvation in himself alone, why will you descend into yourself?\nWhen he assigns you his mere mercy, why will you have recourse to your\nown merits? When he confines all your attention to his mercy, why will\nyou divert part of it to the contemplation of your own works? We must\ntherefore come to that more select people, whom Paul in another place\ntells us “God foreknew,”[473] not using this word, according to the\nfancy of our opponents, to signify a prospect, from a place of idle\nobservation, of things which he has no part in transacting, but in the\nsense in which it is frequently used. For certainly, when Peter says\nthat Christ was “delivered” to death “by the determinate counsel and\nforeknowledge of God,”[474] he introduces God not as a mere spectator,\nbut as the Author of our salvation. So the same apostle, by calling\nbelievers, to whom he writes, “elect according to the foreknowledge of\nGod,”[475] properly expresses that secret predestination by which God\nhas marked out whom he would as his children. And the word _purpose_,\nwhich is added as a synonymous term, and in common speech is always\nexpressive of fixed determination, undoubtedly implies that God, as the\nAuthor of our salvation, does not go out of himself. In this sense\nChrist is called, in the same chapter, the “Lamb foreknown before the\nfoundation of the world.” For what can be more absurd or uninteresting,\nthan God’s looking from on high to see from what quarter salvation would\ncome to mankind? The people, therefore, whom Paul describes as\n“foreknown,”[476] are no other than a small number scattered among the\nmultitude, who falsely pretend to be the people of God. In another place\nalso, to repress the boasting of hypocrites assuming before the world\nthe preëminence among the godly, Paul declares, “The Lord knoweth them\nthat are his.”[477] Lastly, by this expression Paul designates two\nclasses of people, one consisting of the whole race of Abraham, the\nother separated from it, reserved under the eyes of God, and concealed\nfrom the view of men. And this, without doubt, he gathered from Moses,\nwho asserts that God will be merciful to whom he will be merciful;\nthough he is speaking of the chosen people, whose condition was, to\noutward appearance, all alike; as though he had said, that the common\nadoption includes in it peculiar grace towards some, who resemble a more\nsacred treasure; that the common covenant prevents not this small number\nbeing exempted from the common lot; and that, determined to represent\nhimself as the uncontrolled dispenser and arbiter in this affair, he\npositively denies that he will have mercy on one rather than another,\nfrom any other motive than his own pleasure; because, when mercy meets a\nperson who seeks it, though he suffers no repulse, yet he either\nanticipates or in some degree obtains for himself that favour, of which\nGod claims to himself all the praise.\nVII. Now, let the supreme Master and Judge decide the whole matter.\nBeholding in his hearers such extreme obduracy, that his discourses were\nscattered among the multitude almost without any effect, to obviate this\noffence, he exclaims, “All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me.\nAnd this is the Father’s will, that of all which he hath given me, I\nshould lose nothing.”[478] Observe, the origin is from the donation of\nthe Father, that we are given into the custody and protection of Christ.\nHere, perhaps, some one may argue in a circle, and object, that none are\nconsidered as the Father’s peculiar people, but those whose surrender\nhas been voluntary, arising from faith. But Christ only insists on this\npoint—that notwithstanding the defections of vast multitudes, shaking\nthe whole world, yet the counsel of God will be stable and firmer than\nthe heavens, so that election can never fail. They are said to have been\nthe elect of the Father, before he gave them to his only begotten Son.\nIs it inquired whether this was by nature? No, he draws those who were\nstrangers, and so makes them his children. The language of Christ is too\nclear to be perplexed by the quibbles of sophistry: “No man can come to\nme, except the Father draw him. Every man that hath heard and learned of\nthe Father, cometh unto me.”[479] If all men promiscuously submitted to\nChrist, election would be common: now, the fewness of believers\ndiscovers a manifest distinction. Having asserted his disciples\ntherefore, who were given to him, to be the peculiar portion of the\nFather, Christ a little after adds, “I pray not for the world, but for\nthem which thou hast given me, for they are thine;”[480] which shows\nthat the whole world does not belong to its Creator; only that grace\ndelivers from the curse and wrath of God, and from eternal death, a few,\nwho would otherwise perish, but leaves the world in its destruction, to\nwhich it has been destined. At the same time, though Christ introduces\nhimself in his mediatorial capacity, yet he claims to himself the right\nof election, in common with the Father. “I speak not of all,” he says;\n“I know whom I have chosen.”[481] If it be inquired whence he chose\nthem, he elsewhere answers, “out of the world,”[482] which he excludes\nfrom his prayers, when he commends his disciples to the Father. It must\nbe admitted, that when Christ asserts his knowledge of whom he has\nchosen, it refers to a particular class of mankind, and that they are\ndistinguished, not by the nature of their virtues, but by the decree of\nHeaven. Whence it follows, that none attain any excellence by their own\nability or industry, since Christ represents himself as the author of\nelection. His enumeration of Judas among the elect, though he was a\ndevil, only refers to the apostolical office, which, though an\nillustrious instance of the Divine favour, as Paul so frequently\nacknowledges in his own person, yet does not include the hope of eternal\nsalvation. Judas, therefore, in his unfaithful exercise of the\napostleship, might be worse than a devil; but of those whom Christ has\nonce united to his body, he will never suffer one to perish; for in\nsecuring their salvation, he will perform what he has promised, by\nexerting the power of God, who is greater than all. What he says in\nanother place, “Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them\nis lost, but the son of perdition,” is a mode of expression, called\n_catachresis_, but the sense is sufficiently plain. The conclusion is,\nthat God creates whom he chooses to be his children by gratuitous\nadoption; that the cause of this is wholly in himself; because he\nexclusively regards his own secret determination.\nVIII. But, it will be said, Ambrose, Origen, and Jerome believed that\nGod dispenses his grace among men, according to his foreknowledge of the\ngood use which every individual will make of it. Augustine also was once\nof the same sentiment; but when he had made a greater proficiency in\nscriptural knowledge, he not only retracted, but powerfully confuted it.\nAnd after his retractation, rebuking the Pelagians for persisting in\nthis error, he says, “Who but must wonder that this most ingenious sense\nshould escape the apostle? For after proposing what was calculated to\nexcite astonishment respecting those children yet unborn, he started to\nhimself, by way of objection, the following question: What, then, is\nthere unrighteousness with God? It was the place for him to answer, that\nGod foresaw the merits of each of them; yet he says nothing of this, but\nresorts to the decrees and mercy of God.” And in another place, after\nhaving discarded all merits antecedent to election, he says, “Here\nundoubtedly falls to the ground the vain reasoning of those who defend\nthe foreknowledge of God in opposition to his grace, and affirm that we\nwere elected before the foundation of the world, because God foreknew\nthat we would be good, not that he himself would make us good. This is\nnot the language of him who says, ‘Ye have not chosen me, but I have\nchosen you.’[483] For if he elected us because he foreknew our future\ngood, he must also have foreknown our choice of him;” and more to the\nlike purpose. This testimony should have weight with those who readily\nacquiesce in the authority of the fathers. Though Augustine will not\nallow himself to be disunited from the rest, but shows by clear\ntestimonies the falsehood of that discordance, with the odium of which\nhe was loaded by the Pelagians, he makes the following quotations from\nAmbrose’s book on predestination: “Whom Christ has mercy on, him he\ncalls. Those who were indevout he could, if he would, have made devout.\nBut God calls whom he pleases, and makes whom he will religious.” If I\nwere inclined to compile a whole volume from Augustine, I could easily\nshow my readers, that I need no words but his; but I am unwilling to\nburden them with prolixity. But come, let us suppose them to be silent;\nlet us attend to the subject itself. A difficult question was\nraised—Whether it was a just procedure in God to favour with his grace\ncertain particular persons. This Paul could have decided by a single\nword, if he had pleaded the consideration of works. Why, then, does he\nnot do this, but rather continue his discourse involved in the same\ndifficulty? Why, but from necessity? for the Holy Spirit, who spoke by\nhis mouth, never laboured under the malady of forgetfulness. Without any\nevasion or circumlocution, therefore, he answers, that God favours his\nelect because he will, and has mercy because he will. For this oracle,\n“I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on\nwhom I will show mercy,”[484] is equivalent to a declaration, that God\nis excited to mercy by no other motive than his own will to be merciful.\nThe observation of Augustine therefore remains true, “that the grace of\nGod does not find men fit to be elected, but makes them so.”\nIX. We shall not dwell upon the sophistry of Thomas Aquinas, “that the\nforeknowledge of merits is not the cause of predestination in regard to\nthe act of him who predestinates; but that with regard to us, it may in\nsome sense be so called, according to the particular consideration of\npredestination; as when God is said to predestinate glory for man\naccording to merits, because he decreed to give him grace by which glory\nis merited.” For since the Lord allows us to contemplate nothing in\nelection but his mere goodness, the desire of any one to see any thing\nmore is a preposterous disposition. But if we were inclined to a\ncontention of subtilty, we should be at no loss to refute this petty\nsophism of Aquinas. He contends that glory is in a certain sense\npredestinated for the elect according to their merits, because God\npredestinates to them the grace by which glory is merited. What if I, on\nthe contrary, reply, that predestination to grace is subordinate to\nelection to life, and attendant upon it? that grace is predestinated to\nthose to whom the possession of glory has been already assigned; because\nit pleases the Lord to conduct his children from election to\njustification? For hence it will follow, that predestination to glory is\nrather the cause of predestination to grace, than the contrary. But let\nus dismiss these controversies; they are unnecessary with those who\nthink they have wisdom enough in the word of God. For it was truly\nremarked by an ancient ecclesiastical writer, That they who ascribe\nGod’s election to merits, are wiser than they ought to be.\nX. It is objected by some, that God will be inconsistent with himself,\nif he invites all men universally to come to him, and receives only a\nfew elect. Thus, according to them, the universality of the promises\ndestroys the discrimination of special grace; and this is the language\nof some moderate men, not so much for the sake of suppressing the truth,\nas to exclude thorny questions, and restrain the curiosity of many. The\nend is laudable, but the means cannot be approved; for disingenuous\nevasion can never be excused; but with those who use insult and\ninvective, it is a foul cavil or a shameful error. How the Scripture\nreconciles these two facts, that by external preaching all are called to\nrepentance and faith, and yet that the spirit of repentance and faith is\nnot given to all, I have elsewhere stated, and shall soon have occasion\npartly to repeat. What they assume, I deny, as being false in two\nrespects. For he who threatens drought to one city while it rains upon\nanother, and who denounces to another place a famine of doctrine,[485]\nlays himself under no positive obligation to call all men alike. And he\nwho, forbidding Paul to preach the word in Asia, and suffering him not\nto go into Bithynia, calls him into Macedonia,[486] demonstrates his\nright to distribute this treasure to whom he pleases. In Isaiah, he\nstill more fully declares his destination of the promises of salvation\nexclusively for the elect; for of them only, and not indiscriminately of\nall mankind, he declares that they shall be his disciples.[487] Whence\nit appears, that when the doctrine of salvation is offered to all for\ntheir effectual benefit, it is a corrupt prostitution of that which is\ndeclared to be reserved particularly for the children of the church. At\npresent let this suffice, that though the voice of the gospel addresses\nall men generally, yet the gift of faith is bestowed on few. Isaiah\nassigns the cause, that “the arm of the Lord” is not “revealed” to\nall.[488] If he had said, that the gospel is wickedly and perversely\ndespised, because many obstinately refuse to hear it, perhaps there\nwould be some colour for this notion of the universal call. The design\nof the prophet is not to extenuate the guilt of men, when he states that\nthe source of blindness is God’s not deigning to reveal his arm to them;\nhe only suggests that their ears are in vain assailed with external\ndoctrine, because faith is a peculiar gift. I would wish to be informed\nby these teachers, whether men become children of God by mere preaching,\nor by faith. Surely, when John declares that all who believe in God’s\nonly begotten Son, are themselves made the children of God,[489] this is\nnot said of all the hearers of the word in a confused mass, but a\nparticular rank is assigned to believers, “which were born, not of\nblood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of\nGod.”[490] But they say, there is a mutual agreement between faith and\nthe word. This is the case wherever there is any faith; but it is no new\nthing for the seed to fall among thorns or in stony places; not only\nbecause most men are evidently in actual rebellion against God, but\nbecause they are not all endued with eyes and ears. Where, then, will be\nthe consistency of God’s calling to himself such as he knows will never\ncome? Let Augustine answer for me: “Do you wish to dispute with me?\nRather unite with me in admiration, and exclaim, O the depth! Let us\nboth agree in fear, lest we perish in error.” Besides, if election is,\nas Paul represents it, the parent of faith, I retort that argument upon\nthem, that faith cannot be general, because election is special. For\nfrom the connection of causes and effects, it is easily inferred, when\nPaul says, “God hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings, according\nas he hath chosen us before the foundation of the world;” that therefore\nthese treasures are not common to all, because God has chosen only such\nas he pleased. This is the reason why, in another place, he commends\n“the faith of God’s elect;”[491] that none may be supposed to acquire\nfaith by any exertion of their own, but that God may retain the glory of\nfreely illuminating the objects of his previous election. For Bernard\njustly observes, “Friends hear each one for himself when he addresses\nthem, ‘Fear not, little flock, for to you it is given to know the\nmystery of the kingdom of heaven.’ Who are these? Certainly those whom\nhe has foreknown and predestinated to be conformed to the image of his\nSon. The great and secret counsel has been revealed. The Lord knows who\nare his, but what was known to God is manifested to men. Nor does he\nfavour any others with the participation of so great a mystery, but\nthose particular individuals whom he foreknew, and predestinated to be\nhis own.” A little after he concludes, “The mercy of God is from\neverlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him; from everlasting in\npredestination, to everlasting in beatification; the one knowing no\nbeginning; the other, no end.” But what necessity is there for citing\nthe testimony of Bernard, since we hear from the Master’s own mouth,\nthat “no man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God,”[492] which\nimplies, that all who are not regenerated by God, are stupefied with the\nsplendour of his countenance. Faith, indeed, is properly connected with\nelection, provided it occupies the second place. This order is clearly\nexpressed in these words of Christ: “This is the Father’s will, that of\nall which he hath given me, I should lose nothing. And this is the will\nof him that sent me, that every one which believeth on the Son, may have\neverlasting life.”[493] If he willed the salvation of all, he would give\nthem all into the custody of his Son, and unite them all to his body by\nthe sacred bond of faith. Now, it is evident, that faith is the peculiar\npledge of his paternal love, reserved for his adopted children.\nTherefore Christ says in another place, “The sheep follow the shepherd,\nfor they know his voice; and a stranger will they not follow, for they\nknow not the voice of strangers.”[494] Whence arises this difference,\nbut because their ears are divinely penetrated? For no man makes himself\na sheep, but is created such by heavenly grace. Hence also the Lord\nproves the perpetual certainty and security of our salvation, because it\nis kept by the invincible power of God.[495] Therefore he concludes that\nunbelievers are not his sheep, because they are not of the number of\nthose whom God by Isaiah promised to him for his future disciples.[496]\nMoreover, the testimonies I have cited, being expressive of\nperseverance, are so many declarations of the invariable perpetuity of\nelection.\nXI. Now, with respect to the reprobate, whom the apostle introduces in\nthe same place; as Jacob, without any merit yet acquired by good works,\nis made an object of grace, so Esau, while yet unpolluted by any crime,\nis accounted an object of hatred.[497] If we turn our attention to\nworks, we insult the apostle, as though he saw not that which is clear\nto us. Now, that he saw none, is evident, because he expressly asserts\nthe one to have been elected and the other rejected while they had not\ndone any good or evil; in order to prove the foundation of Divine\npredestination not to be in works.[498] Secondly, when he raises the\nobjection whether God is unjust, he never urges, what would have been\nthe most absolute and obvious defence of his justice, that God rewarded\nEsau according to his wickedness; but contents himself with a different\nsolution, that the reprobate are raised up for this purpose, that the\nglory of God may be displayed by their means. Lastly, he subjoins a\nconcluding observation, that “God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy,\nand whom he will he hardeneth.”[499] You see how he attributes both to\nthe mere will of God. If, therefore, we can assign no reason why he\ngrants mercy to his people but because such is his pleasure, neither\nshall we find any other cause but his will for the reprobation of\nothers. For when God is said to harden or show mercy to whom he pleases,\nmen are taught by this declaration to seek no cause beside his will.\nFootnote 463:\nEphes. i. 4.\nFootnote 464:\nCol. i. 12.\nFootnote 465:\nEphes. i. 4, 5.\nFootnote 466:\n2 Tim. i. 9.\nFootnote 467:\nEphes. i. 9.\nFootnote 468:\nJohn xv. 16.\nFootnote 469:\nRom. xi. 35.\nFootnote 470:\nRom. ix. 6.\nFootnote 471:\nRom. ix. 11-13.\nFootnote 472:\nRom. ix. 15.\nFootnote 473:\nRom. xi. 2.\nFootnote 474:\nActs ii. 23.\nFootnote 475:\n1 Pet. i. 2.\nFootnote 476:\nRom. xi. 2.\nFootnote 477:\n2 Tim. ii. 19.\nFootnote 478:\nJohn vi. 37, 39.\nFootnote 479:\nJohn vi. 44, 45.\nFootnote 480:\nJohn xvii. 9.\nFootnote 481:\nJohn xiii. 18.\nFootnote 482:\nJohn xv. 19.\nFootnote 483:\nJohn xv. 16.\nFootnote 484:\nExod. xxxiii. 19.\nFootnote 485:\nAmos iv. 7; viii. 11.\nFootnote 486:\nActs xvi. 6-10.\nFootnote 487:\nIsaiah viii. 16, &c.\nFootnote 488:\nIsaiah liii. 1.\nFootnote 489:\nJohn i. 12.\nFootnote 490:\nJohn i. 13.\nFootnote 491:\nTitus i. 1.\nFootnote 492:\nJohn vi. 46.\nFootnote 493:\nJohn vi. 39, 40.\nFootnote 494:\nJohn x. 4, 5.\nFootnote 495:\nJohn x. 29.\nFootnote 496:\nJohn x. 26.\nFootnote 497:\nRom. ix. 13.\nFootnote 498:\nRom. ix. 11.\nFootnote 499:\nRom. ix. 18."

          "title": "CHAPTER XXIII.",
          "content": "A REFUTATION OF THE CALUMNIES GENERALLY, BUT UNJUSTLY, URGED AGAINST\nTHIS DOCTRINE.\nWhen the human mind hears these things, its petulance breaks all\nrestraint, and it discovers as serious and violent agitation as if\nalarmed by the sound of a martial trumpet. Many, indeed, as if they\nwished to avert odium from God, admit election in such a way as to deny\nthat any one is reprobated. But this is puerile and absurd, because\nelection itself could not exist without being opposed to reprobation.\nGod is said to separate those whom he adopts to salvation. To say that\nothers obtain by chance, or acquire by their own efforts, that which\nelection alone confers on a few, will be worse than absurd. Whom God\npasses by, therefore, he reprobates, and from no other cause than his\ndetermination to exclude them from the inheritance which he predestines\nfor his children. And the petulance of men is intolerable, if it refuses\nto be restrained by the word of God, which treats of his\nincomprehensible counsel, adored by angels themselves. But now we have\nheard that hardening proceeds from the Divine power and will, as much as\nmercy. Unlike the persons I have mentioned, Paul never strives to excuse\nGod by false allegations; he only declares that it is unlawful for a\nthing formed to quarrel with its maker.[500] Now, how will those, who\nadmit not that any are reprobated by God, evade this declaration of\nChrist: “Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be\nrooted up?”[501] Upon all whom our heavenly Father has not deigned to\nplant as sacred trees in his garden, they hear destruction plainly\ndenounced. If they deny this to be a sign of reprobation, there is\nnothing so clear as to be capable of proof to such persons. But if they\ncease not their clamour, let the sobriety of faith be satisfied with\nthis admonition of Paul, that there is no cause for quarrelling with\nGod, if, on the one hand, willing to show his wrath, and to make his\npower known, he endures, “with much long-suffering, the vessels of wrath\nfitted to destruction;” and on the other, makes “known the riches of his\nglory on the vessels of mercy, whom he had afore prepared unto\nglory.”[502] Let the reader observe that, to preclude every pretext for\nmurmurs and censures, Paul ascribes supreme dominion to the wrath and\npower of God; because it is unreasonable for those deep judgments, which\nabsorb all our faculties, to be called in question by us. It is a\nfrivolous reply of our adversaries, that God does not wholly reject the\nobjects of his long-suffering, but remains in suspense towards them,\nawaiting the possibility of their repentance; as though Paul attributed\npatience to God, in expectation of the conversion of those whom he\nasserts to be fitted to destruction. For Augustine, in expounding this\npassage, where power is connected with patience, justly observes, that\nGod’s power is not permissive, but influential. They observe, also, that\nit is not said without meaning, that the vessels of wrath are fitted to\ndestruction, but that God prepared the vessels of mercy; since by this\nmode of expression, he ascribes and challenges to God the praise of\nsalvation, and throws the blame of perdition upon those who by their\nchoice procure it to themselves. But though I concede to them, that Paul\nsoftens the asperity of the former clause by the difference of\nphraseology, yet it is not at all consistent to transfer the preparation\nfor destruction to any other than the secret counsel of God; which is\nalso asserted just before in the context, that “God raised up Pharaoh,\nand whom he will he hardeneth.” Whence it follows, that the cause of\nhardening is the secret counsel of God. This, however, I maintain, which\nis observed by Augustine that when God turns wolves into sheep, he\nrenovates them by more powerful grace to conquer their obduracy; and\ntherefore the obstinate are not converted, because God exerts not that\nmightier grace, of which he is not destitute, if he chose to display it.\nII. These things will amply suffice for persons of piety and modesty,\nwho remember that they are men. But as these virulent adversaries are\nnot content with one species of opposition, we will reply to them all as\noccasion shall require. Foolish mortals enter into many contentions with\nGod, as though they could arraign him to plead to their accusations. In\nthe first place they inquire, by what right the Lord is angry with his\ncreatures who had not provoked him by any previous offence; for that to\ndevote to destruction whom he pleases, is more like the caprice of a\ntyrant than the lawful sentence of a judge; that men have reason,\ntherefore, to expostulate with God, if they are predestinated to eternal\ndeath without any demerit of their own, merely by his sovereign will. If\nsuch thoughts ever enter the minds of pious men, they will be\nsufficiently enabled to break their violence by this one consideration,\nhow exceedingly presumptuous it is only to inquire into the causes of\nthe Divine will; which is in fact, and is justly entitled to be, the\ncause of every thing that exists. For if it has any cause, then there\nmust be something antecedent, on which it depends; which it is impious\nto suppose. For the will of God is the highest rule of justice; so that\nwhat he wills must be considered just, for this very reason, because he\nwills it. When it is inquired, therefore, why the Lord did so, the\nanswer must be, Because he would. But if you go further, and ask why he\nso determined, you are in search of something greater and higher than\nthe will of God, which can never be found. Let human temerity,\ntherefore, desist from seeking that which is not, lest it should fail of\nfinding that which is. This will be a sufficient restraint to any one\ndisposed to reason with reverence concerning the secrets of his God.\nAgainst the audaciousness of the impious, who are not afraid openly to\nrail against God, the Lord will sufficiently defend himself by his own\njustice, without any vindication by us, when, depriving their\nconsciences of every subterfuge, he shall convict them and bind them\nwith a sense of their guilt. Yet we espouse not the notion of the Romish\ntheologians concerning the absolute and arbitrary power of God, which,\non account of its profaneness, deserves our detestation. We represent\nnot God as lawless, who is a law to himself; because, as Plato says,\nlaws are necessary to men, who are the subjects of evil desires; but the\nwill of God is not only pure from every fault, but the highest standard\nof perfection, even the law of all laws. But we deny that he is liable\nto be called to any account; we deny also that we are proper judges, to\ndecide on this cause according to our own apprehension. Wherefore, if we\nattempt to go beyond what is lawful, let us be deterred by the Psalmist,\nwho tells us, that God will be clear when he is judged by mortal\nman.[503]\nIII. Thus God is able to check his enemies by silence. But that we may\nnot suffer them to deride his holy name with impunity, he supplies us\nfrom his word with arms against them. Therefore, if any one attack us\nwith such an inquiry as this, why God has from the beginning\npredestinated some men to death, who, not yet being brought into\nexistence, could not yet deserve the sentence of death,—we will reply by\nasking them, in return, what they suppose God owes to man, if he chooses\nto judge of him from his own nature. As we are all corrupted by sin, we\nmust necessarily be odious to God, and that not from tyrannical cruelty,\nbut in the most equitable estimation of justice. If all whom the Lord\npredestinates to death are in their natural condition liable to the\nsentence of death, what injustice do they complain of receiving from\nhim? Let all the sons of Adam come forward; let them all contend and\ndispute with their Creator, because by his eternal providence they were\npreviously to their birth adjudged to endless misery. What murmur will\nthey be able to raise against this vindication, when God, on the other\nhand, shall call them to a review of themselves. If they have all been\ntaken from a corrupt mass, it is no wonder that they are subject to\ncondemnation. Let them not, therefore, accuse God of injustice, if his\neternal decree has destined them to death, to which they feel\nthemselves, whatever be their desire or aversion, spontaneously led\nforward by their own nature. Hence appears the perverseness of their\ndisposition to murmur, because they intentionally suppress the cause of\ncondemnation, which they are constrained to acknowledge in themselves,\nhoping to excuse themselves by charging it upon God. But though I ever\nso often admit God to be the author of it, which is perfectly correct,\nyet this does not abolish the guilt impressed upon their consciences,\nand from time to time recurring to their view.\nIV. They further object, Were they not, by the decree of God,\nantecedently predestinated to that corruption which is now stated as the\ncause of condemnation? When they perish in their corruption, therefore,\nthey only suffer the punishment of that misery into which, in\nconsequence of his predestination, Adam fell, and precipitated his\nposterity with him. Is he not unjust, therefore, in treating his\ncreatures with such cruel mockery? I confess, indeed, that all the\ndescendants of Adam fell by the Divine will into that miserable\ncondition in which they are now involved; and this is what I asserted\nfrom the beginning, that we must always return at last to the sovereign\ndetermination of God’s will, the cause of which is hidden in himself.\nBut it follows not, therefore, that God is liable to this reproach. For\nwe will answer them thus in the language of Paul: “O man, who art thou\nthat repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed\nit, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay,\nof the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour and another unto\ndishonour?”[504] They will deny this to be in reality any vindication of\nGod’s justice, and call it a subterfuge, such as is commonly resorted to\nby persons destitute of a sufficient defence. For what appears to be the\nmeaning of this, but that God possesses power, that cannot be resisted,\nof doing any thing whatsoever according to his pleasure? But it is very\ndifferent. For what stronger reason can be alleged, than when we are\ndirected to consider who God is? How could any injustice be committed by\nhim who is the Judge of the world? If it is the peculiar property of the\nnature of God to do justice, then he naturally loves righteousness and\nhates iniquity. The apostle, therefore, has not resorted to sophistry,\nas if he were in danger of confutation, but has shown that the reason of\nthe Divine justice is too high to be measured by a human standard, or\ncomprehended by the littleness of the human mind. The apostle, indeed,\nacknowledges that there is a depth in the Divine judgments sufficient to\nabsorb the minds of all mankind, if they attempt to penetrate it. But he\nalso teaches how criminal it is to reduce the works of God to such a\nlaw, that on failing to discover the reason of them, we presume to\ncensure them. It is a well known observation of Solomon, though few\nrightly understand it, that “the great God, that formed all things, both\nrewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.”[505] For he is\nproclaiming the greatness of God, whose will it is to punish fools and\ntransgressors, although he favours them not with his Spirit. And men\nbetray astonishing madness in desiring to comprehend immensity within\nthe limits of their reason. The angels who stood in their integrity,\nPaul calls “elect;”[506] if their constancy rested on the Divine\npleasure, the defection of the others argues their being forsaken—a fact\nfor which no other cause can be assigned than the reprobation hidden in\nthe secret counsel of God.\nV. Now, to any follower of Manes or Celestius, a calumniator of Divine\nProvidence, I reply with Paul, that no account ought to be given of it,\nfor its greatness far surpasses our understanding. What wonder or\nabsurdity is there in this? Would he have the Divine power so limited,\nas to be unable to execute more than his little capacity can comprehend?\nI say, with Augustine, that the Lord created those who, he certainly\nforeknew, would fall into destruction, and that this was actually so\nbecause he willed it; but of his will it belongs not to us to demand the\nreason, which we are incapable of comprehending; nor is it reasonable\nthat the Divine will should be made the subject of controversy with us,\nwhich, whenever it is discussed, is only another name for the highest\nrule of justice. Why, then, is any question started concerning\ninjustice, where justice is evidently conspicuous? Nor let us be ashamed\nto follow the example of Paul, and stop the mouths of unreasonable and\nwicked men in this manner, repeating the same answer as often as they\nshall dare to repeat their complaints. Who are you, miserable mortals,\npreferring an accusation against God, because he accommodates not the\ngreatness of his works to your ignorance? as though they were\nnecessarily wrong, because they are concealed from carnal view. Of the\nimmensity of God’s judgments you have the clearest evidences. You know\nthey are called “a great deep.” Now, examine your contracted intellects,\nwhether they can comprehend God’s secret decrees. What advantage or\nsatisfaction do you gain from plunging yourselves, by your mad\nresearches, into an abyss that reason itself pronounces will be fatal to\nyou? Why are you not at least restrained by some fear of what is\ncontained in the history of Job and the books of the prophets,\nconcerning the inconceivable wisdom and terrible power of God? If your\nmind is disturbed, embrace without reluctance the advice of Augustine:\n“You, a man, expect an answer from me, who am also a man. Let us,\ntherefore, both hear him, who says, O man, who art thou? Faithful\nignorance is better than presumptuous knowledge. Seek merits; you will\nfind nothing but punishment. O the depth! Peter denies; the thief\nbelieves; O the depth! Do you seek a reason? I will tremble at the\ndepth. Do you reason? I will wonder. Do you dispute? I will believe. I\nsee the depth, I reach not the bottom. Paul rested, because he found\nadmiration. He calls the judgments of God unsearchable; and are you come\nto scrutinize them? He says, his ways are past finding out; and are you\ncome to investigate them?” We shall do no good by proceeding any\nfurther; it will not satisfy their petulance; and the Lord needs no\nother defence than what he has employed by his Spirit, speaking by the\nmouth of Paul; and we forget to speak well when we cease to speak with\nGod.\nVI. Impiety produces also a second objection, which directly tends, not\nso much to the crimination of God, as to the vindication of the sinner;\nthough the sinner whom God condemns cannot be justified without the\ndisgrace of the Judge. For this is their profane complaint, Why should\nGod impute as a fault to man those things which were rendered necessary\nby his predestination? What should they do? Should they resist his\ndecrees? This would be vain, for it would be impossible. Therefore they\nare not justly punished for those things of which God’s predestination\nis the principal cause. Here I shall refrain from the defence commonly\nresorted to by ecclesiastical writers, that the foreknowledge of God\nprevents not man from being considered as a sinner, since God foresees\nman’s evils, not his own. For then the cavil would not stop here; it\nwould rather be urged, that still God might, if he would, have provided\nagainst the evils he foresaw, and that not having done this, he created\nman expressly to this end, that he might so conduct himself in the\nworld; but if, by the Divine Providence, man was created in such a state\nas afterwards to do whatever he actually does, he ought not to be\ncharged with guilt for things which he cannot avoid, and to which the\nwill of God constrains him. Let us see, then, how this difficulty should\nbe solved. In the first place, the declaration of Solomon ought to be\nuniversally admitted, that “the Lord hath made all things for himself;\nyea, even the wicked for the day of evil.”[507] Observe; all things\nbeing at God’s disposal, and the decision of salvation or death\nbelonging to him, he orders all things by his counsel and decree in such\na manner, that some men are born devoted from the womb to certain death,\nthat his name may be glorified in their destruction. If any one pleads,\nthat no necessity was imposed on them by the providence of God, but\nrather that they were created by him in such a state in consequence of\nhis foresight of their future depravity,—it will amount to nothing. The\nold writers used, indeed, to adopt this solution, though not without\nsome degree of hesitation. But the schoolmen satisfy themselves with it,\nas though it admitted of no opposition. I will readily grant, indeed,\nthat mere foreknowledge lays no necessity on the creatures, though this\nis not universally admitted; for there are some who maintain it to be\nthe actual cause of what comes to pass. But Valla, a man otherwise not\nmuch versed in theology, appears to me to have discovered superior\nacuteness and judiciousness, by showing that this controversy is\nunnecessary, because both life and death are acts of God’s will, rather\nthan of his foreknowledge. If God simply foresaw the fates of men, and\ndid not also dispose and fix them by his determination, there would be\nroom to agitate the question, whether his providence or foresight\nrendered them at all necessary. But since he foresees future events only\nin consequence of his decree, that they shall happen, it is useless to\ncontend about foreknowledge, while it is evident that all things come to\npass rather by ordination and decree.\nVII. They say it is nowhere declared in express terms, that God decreed\nAdam should perish by his defection; as though the same God, whom the\nScripture represents as doing whatever he pleases, created the noblest\nof his creatures without any determinate end. They maintain, that he was\npossessed of free choice, that he might be the author of his own fate,\nbut that God decreed nothing more than to treat him according to his\ndesert. If so weak a scheme as this be received, what will become of\nGod’s omnipotence, by which he governs all things according to his\nsecret counsel, independently of every person or thing besides? But\nwhether they wish it or dread it, predestination exhibits itself in\nAdam’s posterity. For the loss of salvation by the whole race through\nthe guilt of one parent, was an event that did not happen by nature.\nWhat prevents their acknowledging concerning one man, what they\nreluctantly grant concerning the whole species? Why should they lose\ntheir labour in sophistical evasions? The Scripture proclaims, that all\nmen were, in the person of their father, sentenced to eternal death.\nThis, not being attributable to nature, it is evident must have\nproceeded from the wonderful counsel of God. The perplexity and\nhesitation discovered at trifles by these pious defenders of the justice\nof God, and their facility in overcoming great difficulties, are truly\nabsurd. I inquire again, how it came to pass that the fall of Adam,\nindependent of any remedy, should involve so many nations with their\ninfant children in eternal death, but because such was the will of God.\nTheir tongues, so loquacious on every other point, must here be struck\ndumb. It is an awful decree, I confess; but no one can deny that God\nforeknew the future final fate of man before he created him, and that he\ndid foreknow it because it was appointed by his own decree. If any one\nhere attacks God’s foreknowledge, he rashly and inconsiderately\nstumbles. For what ground of accusation is there against the heavenly\nJudge for not being ignorant of futurity? If there is any just or\nplausible complaint, it lies against predestination. Nor should it be\nthought absurd to affirm, that God not only foresaw the fall of the\nfirst man, and the ruin of his posterity in him, but also arranged all\nby the determination of his own will. For as it belongs to his wisdom to\nforeknow every thing future, so it belongs to his power to rule and\ngovern all things by his hand. And this question also, as well as\nothers, is judiciously discussed by Augustine. “We most wholesomely\nconfess, what we most rightly believe, that the God and Lord of all\nthings, who created every thing very good, and foreknew that evil would\narise out of good, and knew that it was more suitable to his almighty\ngoodness to bring good out of evil than not to suffer evil to exist,\nordained the life of angels and men in such a manner as to exhibit in\nit, first, what free-will was capable of doing, and afterwards, what\ncould be effected by the blessings of his grace, and the sentence of his\njustice.”\nVIII. Here they recur to the distinction between will and permission,\nand insist that God permits the destruction of the impious, but does not\nwill it. But what reason shall we assign for his permitting it, but\nbecause it is his will? It is not probable, however, that man procured\nhis own destruction by the mere permission, and without any appointment,\nof God; as though God had not determined what he would choose to be the\ncondition of the principal of his creatures. I shall not hesitate,\ntherefore, to confess plainly with Augustine, “that the will of God is\nthe necessity of things, and that what he has willed will necessarily\ncome to pass; as those things are really about to happen which he has\nforeseen.” Now, if either Pelagians, or Manichæans, or Anabaptists, or\nEpicureans, (for we are concerned with these four sects on this\nargument,) in excuse for themselves and the impious, plead the necessity\nwith which they are bound by God’s predestination,—they allege nothing\napplicable to the case. For if predestination is no other than a\ndispensation of Divine justice,—mysterious indeed, but liable to no\nblame,—since it is certain they were not unworthy of being predestinated\nto that fate, it is equally certain, that the destruction they incur by\npredestination is consistent with the strictest justice. Besides, their\nperdition depends on the Divine predestination in such a manner, that\nthe cause and matter of it are found in themselves. For the first man\nfell because the Lord had determined it was so expedient. The reason of\nthis determination is unknown to us. Yet it is certain that he\ndetermined thus, only because he foresaw it would tend to the just\nillustration of the glory of his name. Whenever you hear the glory of\nGod mentioned, think of his justice. For what deserves praise must be\njust. Man falls, therefore, according to the appointment of Divine\nProvidence; but he falls by his own fault. The Lord had a little before\npronounced “every thing that he had made” to be “very good.” Whence,\nthen, comes the depravity of man to revolt from his God? Lest it should\nbe thought to come from creation, God had approved and commended what\nhad proceeded from himself. By his own wickedness, therefore, he\ncorrupted the nature he had received pure from the Lord, and by his fall\nhe drew all his posterity with him into destruction. Wherefore let us\nrather contemplate the evident cause of condemnation, which is nearer to\nus in the corrupt nature of mankind, than search after a hidden and\naltogether incomprehensible one in the predestination of God. And we\nshould feel no reluctance to submit our understanding to the infinite\nwisdom of God, so far as to acquiesce in its many mysteries. To be\nignorant of things which it is neither possible nor lawful to know, is\nto be learned: an eagerness to know them, is a species of madness.\nIX. Some one perhaps will say, that I have not yet adduced a sufficient\nanswer to that sacrilegious excuse. I confess it is impossible ever\nwholly to prevent the petulance and murmurs of impiety; yet I think I\nhave said what should suffice to remove not only all just ground, but\nevery plausible pretext, for objection. The reprobate wish to be thought\nexcusable in sinning, because they cannot avoid a necessity of sinning;\nespecially since this necessity is laid upon them by the ordination of\nGod. But we deny this to be a just excuse; because the ordination of\nGod, by which they complain that they are destined to destruction, is\nguided by equity, unknown indeed to us, but indubitably certain. Whence\nwe conclude, that they sustain no misery that is not inflicted upon them\nby the most righteous judgment of God. In the next place, we maintain\nthat they act preposterously, who, in seeking for the origin of their\ncondemnation, direct their views to the secret recesses of the Divine\ncounsel, and overlook the corruption of nature, which is its real\nsource. The testimony God gives to his creation prevents their imputing\nit to him. For though, by the eternal providence of God, man was created\nto that misery to which he is subject, yet the ground of it he has\nderived from himself, not from God; since he is thus ruined solely in\nconsequence of his having degenerated from the pure creation of God to\nvicious and impure depravity.\nX. The doctrine of God’s predestination is calumniated by its\nadversaries, as involving a third absurdity. For when we attribute it\nsolely to the determination of the Divine will, that those whom God\nadmits to be heirs of his kingdom are exempted from the universal\ndestruction, from this they infer, that he is a respecter of persons,\nwhich the Scripture uniformly denies; that, therefore, either the\nScripture is inconsistent with itself, or in the election of God regard\nis had to merits. In the first place, the Scripture denies that God is a\nrespecter of persons, in a different sense from that in which they\nunderstand it; for by the word _person_, it signifies not a man, but\nthose things in a man, which, being conspicuous to the eyes, usually\nconciliate favour, honour, and dignity, or attract hatred, contempt, and\ndisgrace. Such are riches, wealth, power, nobility, magistracy, country,\nelegance of form, on the one hand; and on the other hand, poverty,\nnecessity, ignoble birth, slovenliness, contempt, and the like. Thus\nPeter and Paul declare that God is not a respecter of persons, because\nhe makes no difference between the Jew and Greek, to reject one and\nreceive the other, merely on account of his nation.[508] So James uses\nthe same language when he means to assert, that God in his judgment pays\nno regard to riches.[509] And Paul, in another place, declares, that in\njudging, God has no respect to liberty or bondage.[510] There will,\ntherefore, be no contradiction in our affirming, that according to the\ngood pleasure of his will, God chooses whom he will as his children,\nirrespective of all merit, while he rejects and reprobates others. Yet,\nfor the sake of further satisfaction, the matter may be explained in the\nfollowing manner: They ask how it happens, that of two persons\ndistinguished from each other by no merit, God, in his election, leaves\none and takes another. I, on the other hand, ask them, whether they\nsuppose him that is taken to possess any thing that can attract the\nfavour of God. If they confess that he has not, as indeed they must, it\nwill follow, that God looks not at man, but derives his motive to favour\nhim from his own goodness. God’s election of one man, therefore, while\nhe rejects another, proceeds not from any respect of man, but solely\nfrom his own mercy; which may freely display and exert itself wherever\nand whenever it pleases. For we have elsewhere seen also that, from the\nbeginning, not many noble, or wise, or honourable were called,[511] that\nGod might humble the pride of flesh; so far is his favour from being\nconfined to persons.\nXI. Wherefore some people falsely and wickedly charge God with a\nviolation of equal justice, because, in his predestination, he observes\nnot the same uniform course of proceeding towards all. If he finds all\nguilty, they say, let him punish all alike; if innocent, let him\nwithhold the rigour of justice from all. But they deal with him just as\nif either mercy were forbidden him, or, when he chooses to show mercy,\nhe were constrained wholly to renounce justice. What is it that they\nrequire? If all are guilty, that they shall all suffer the same\npunishment. We confess the guilt to be common, but we say, that some are\nrelieved by Divine mercy. They say, Let it relieve all. But we reply,\nJustice requires that he should likewise show himself to be a just judge\nin the infliction of punishment. When they object to this, what is it\nbut attempting to deprive God of the opportunity to manifest his mercy,\nor to grant it to him, at least, on the condition that he wholly abandon\nhis justice? Wherefore there is the greatest propriety in these\nobservations of Augustine: “The whole mass of mankind having fallen into\ncondemnation in the first man, the vessels that are formed from it to\nhonour, are not vessels of personal righteousness, but of Divine mercy;\nand the formation of others to dishonour, is to be attributed, not to\niniquity, but to the Divine decree,” &c. While God rewards those whom he\nrejects with deserved punishment, and to those whom he calls, freely\ngives undeserved grace, he is liable to no accusation, but may be\ncompared to a creditor, who has power to release one, and enforce his\ndemands on another. The Lord, therefore, may give grace to whom he will,\nbecause he is merciful, and yet not give it to all, because he is a just\njudge; may manifest his free grace, by giving to some what they never\ndeserve, while, by not giving to all, he declares the demerit of all.\nFor when Paul says, that “God hath concluded all under sin, that he\nmight have mercy upon all,”[512] it must, at the same time, be added,\nthat he is debtor to none; for no man “hath first given to him,” to\nentitle him to demand a recompense.[513]\nXII. Another argument often urged to overthrow predestination is, that\nits establishment would destroy all solicitude and exertion for\nrectitude of conduct. For who can hear, they say, that either life or\ndeath is appointed for him by God’s eternal and immutable decree,\nwithout immediately concluding that it is of no importance how he\nconducts himself; since no action of his can in any respect either\nimpede or promote the predestination of God? Thus all will abandon\nthemselves to despair, and run into every excess to which their\nlicentious propensities may lead them. And truly this objection is not\naltogether destitute of truth; for there are many impure persons who\nbespatter the doctrine of predestination with these vile blasphemies,\nand with this pretext elude all admonitions and reproofs: God knows what\nhe has determined to do with us: if he has decreed our salvation, he\nwill bring us to it in his own time; if he has destined us to death, it\nwill be in vain for us to strive against it. But the Scripture, while it\ninculcates superior awe and reverence of mind in the consideration of so\ngreat a mystery, instructs the godly in a very different conclusion, and\nfully refutes the wicked and unreasonable inferences of these persons.\nFor the design of what it contains respecting predestination is, not\nthat, being excited to presumption, we may attempt, with nefarious\ntemerity, to scrutinize the inaccessible secrets of God, but rather\nthat, being humbled and dejected, we may learn to tremble at his justice\nand admire his mercy. At this object believers will aim. But the impure\ncavils of the wicked are justly restrained by Paul. They profess to go\non securely in their vices; because if they are of the number of the\nelect, such conduct will not prevent their being finally brought into\nlife. But Paul declares the end of our election to be, that we may lead\na holy and blameless life.[514] If the object of election be holiness of\nlife, it should rather awaken and stimulate us to a cheerful practice of\nit, than be used as a pretext for slothfulness. But how inconsistent is\nit to cease from the practice of virtue because election is sufficient\nto salvation, while the end proposed in election is our diligent\nperformance of virtuous actions! Away, then, with such corrupt and\nsacrilegious perversions of the whole order of election. They carry\ntheir blasphemies much further, by asserting, that any one who is\nreprobated by God will labour to no purpose if he endeavour to approve\nhimself to him by innocence and integrity of life; but here they are\nconvicted of a most impudent falsehood. For whence could such exertion\noriginate but from election? Whoever are of the number of the reprobate,\nbeing vessels made to dishonour, cease not to provoke the Divine wrath\nagainst them by continual transgressions, and to confirm by evident\nproofs the judgment of God already denounced against them; so that their\nstriving with him in vain is what can never happen.\nXIII. This doctrine is maliciously and impudently calumniated by others,\nas subversive of all exhortations to piety of life. This formerly\nbrought great odium upon Augustine, which he removed by his Treatise on\nCorrection and Grace, addressed to Valentine, the perusal of which will\neasily satisfy all pious and teachable persons. Yet I will touch on a\nfew things, which I hope will convince such as are honest and not\ncontentious. How openly and loudly gratuitous election was preached by\nPaul, we have already seen; was he therefore cold in admonitions and\nexhortations? Let these good zealots compare his vehemence with theirs;\ntheirs will be found ice itself in comparison with his incredible\nfervour. And certainly every scruple is removed by this principle, that\n“God hath not called us to uncleanness but that every one should know\nhow to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;”[515] and again,\nthat “we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,\nwhich God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.”[516]\nIndeed, a slight acquaintance with Paul will enable any one to\nunderstand, without tedious arguments, how easily he reconciles things\nwhich they pretend to be repugnant to each other. Christ commands men to\nbelieve in him. Yet his limitation is neither false nor contrary to his\ncommand, when he says, “No man can come unto me, except it were given\nunto him of my Father.”[517] Let preaching therefore have its course to\nbring men to faith, and by a continual progress to promote their\nperseverance. Nor let the knowledge of predestination be prevented, that\nthe obedient may not be proud as of any thing of their own, but may\nglory in the Lord. Christ had some particular meaning in saying, “Who\nhath ears to hear, let him hear.”[518] Therefore when we exhort and\npreach, persons endued with ears readily obey; and those who are\ndestitute of them exhibit an accomplishment of the Scripture, that\nhearing they hear not.[519] “But why (says Augustine) should some have\nears, and others not? ‘Who hath known the mind of the Lord?’[520] Must\nthat which is evident be denied, because that which is concealed cannot\nbe comprehended?” These observations I have faithfully borrowed from\nAugustine; but as his words will perhaps have more authority than mine,\nI will proceed to an exact quotation of them. “If, on hearing this, some\npersons become torpid and slothful, and exchanging labour for lawless\ndesire, pursue the various objects of concupiscence, must what is\ndeclared concerning the foreknowledge of God be therefore accounted\nfalse? If God foreknew that they would be good, will they not be so, in\nwhatever wickedness they now live? and if he foreknew that they would be\nwicked, will they not be so, in whatever goodness they now appear? Are\nthese, then, sufficient causes why the truths which are declared\nconcerning the foreknowledge of God should be either denied or passed\nover in silence? especially when the consequence of silence respecting\nthese would be the adoption of other errors. The reason of concealing\nthe truth (he says) is one thing, and the necessity of declaring it is\nanother. It would be tedious to inquire after all the reasons for\npassing the truth over in silence; but this is one of them; lest those\nwho understand it not should become worse, while we wish to make those\nwho understand it better informed; who, indeed, are not made wiser by\nour declaring any such thing, nor are they rendered worse. But since the\ntruth is of such a nature, that when we speak of it, he becomes worse\nwho cannot understand it, and when we are silent about it, he who can\nunderstand it becomes worse,—what do we think ought to be done? Should\nnot the truth rather be spoken, that he who is capable may understand\nit, than buried in silence; the consequence of which would be, not only\nthat neither would know it, but even the more intelligent of the two\nwould become worse, who, if he heard and understood it, would also teach\nit to many others? And we are unwilling to say what we are authorized to\nsay by the testimony of Scripture. For we are afraid, indeed, lest by\nspeaking we may offend him who cannot understand, but are not afraid\nlest in consequence of our silence, he who is capable of understanding\nthe truth may be deceived by falsehood.” And condensing this sentiment\nafterwards into a smaller compass, he places it in a still stronger\nlight. “Wherefore, if the apostles and the succeeding teachers of the\nChurch both piously treated of God’s eternal election, and held\nbelievers under the discipline of a pious life, what reason have these\nour opponents, when silenced by the invincible force of truth, to\nsuppose themselves right in maintaining that what is spoken of\npredestination, although it be true, ought not to be preached to the\npeople? But it must by all means be preached, that he who has ears to\nhear may hear. But who has them, unless he receives them from him who\nhas promised to bestow them? Certainly he who receives not may reject,\nprovided he who receives, takes and drinks, drinks and lives. For as\npiety must be preached that God may be rightly worshipped, so also must\npredestination, that he who has ears to hear of the grace of God, may\nglory in God, and not in himself.”\nXIV. And yet, being peculiarly desirous of edification, that holy man\nregulates his mode of teaching the truth, so that offence may as far as\npossible be prudently avoided. For he suggests that whatever is asserted\nwith truth may also be delivered in a suitable manner. If any one\naddress the people in such a way as this, If you believe not, it is\nbecause you are by a Divine decree already destined to destruction,—he\nnot only cherishes slothfulness, but even encourages wickedness. If any\none extend the declaration to the future, that they who hear will never\nbelieve because they are reprobated,—this would be rather imprecation\nthan instruction. Such persons, therefore, as foolish teachers, or\ninauspicious, ominous prophets, Augustine charges to depart from the\nChurch. In another place, indeed, he justly maintains, “that a man then\nprofits by correction, when he, who causes whom he pleases to profit\neven without correction, compassionates and assists. But why some in one\nway, and some in another? Far be it from us to ascribe the choice to the\nclay instead of the potter.” Again afterwards: “When men are either\nintroduced or restored into the way of righteousness by correction, who\nworks salvation in their hearts, but he who gives the increase, whoever\nplants and waters? he whose determination to save is not resisted by any\nfree-will of man. It is beyond all doubt, therefore, that the will of\nGod, who has done whatever he has pleased in heaven and in earth, and\nwho has done even things that are yet future, cannot possibly be\nresisted by the will of man, so as to prevent the execution of his\npurposes: since he controls the wills of men according to his pleasure.”\nAgain: “When he designs to bring men to himself, does he bind them by\ncorporeal bonds? He acts inwardly; he inwardly seizes their hearts; he\ninwardly moves their hearts, and draws them by their wills, which he has\nwrought in them.” But he immediately subjoins, what must by no means be\nomitted; “that because we know not who belongs, or does not belong, to\nthe number of the predestinated, it becomes us affectionately to desire\nthe salvation of all. The consequence will be, that whomsoever we meet\nwe shall endeavour to make him a partaker of peace. But our peace shall\nrest upon the sons of peace. On our part, therefore, salutary and severe\nreproof, like a medicine, must be administered to all, that they may\nneither perish themselves nor destroy others; but it will be the\nprovince of God to render it useful to them whom he had foreknown and\npredestinated.”\nFootnote 500:\nRom. ix. 20.\nFootnote 501:\nMatt. xv. 13.\nFootnote 502:\nRom. ix. 22, 23.\nFootnote 503:\nPsalm li. 4.\nFootnote 504:\nRom. v. 20, 21.\nFootnote 505:\nProv. xxvi. 10.\nFootnote 506:\n1 Tim. v. 21.\nFootnote 507:\nProv. xvi. 4.\nFootnote 508:\nActs x. 34.

          "content": "ELECTION CONFIRMED BY THE DIVINE CALL. THE DESTINED DESTRUCTION OF THE\nREPROBATE PROCURED BY THEMSELVES.\nBut, in order to a further elucidation of the subject, it is necessary\nto treat of the calling of the elect, and of the blinding and hardening\nof the impious. On the former I have already made a few observations,\nwith a view to refute the error of those who suppose the generality of\nthe promises to put all mankind on an equality. But the discriminating\nelection of God, which is otherwise concealed within himself, he\nmanifests only by his calling, which may therefore with propriety be\ntermed the testification or evidence of it. “For whom he did foreknow,\nhe also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.\nMoreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he\ncalled, them he also justified,” in order to their eventual\nglorification.[521] Though by choosing his people, the Lord has adopted\nthem as his children, yet we see that they enter not on the possession\nof so great a blessing till they are called; on the other hand, as soon\nas they are called, they immediately enjoy some communication of his\nelection. On this account Paul calls the Spirit received by them, both\n“the Spirit of adoption, and the seal and earnest of the future\ninheritance;”[522] because, by his testimony, he confirms and seals to\ntheir hearts the certainty of their future adoption. For though the\npreaching of the gospel is a stream from the source of election, yet,\nbeing common also to the reprobate, it would of itself be no solid proof\nof it. For God effectually teaches his elect, to bring them to faith, as\nwe have already cited from the words of Christ: “He which is of God,\nhe,” and he alone, “hath seen the Father.”[523] Again: “I have\nmanifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me.”[524] For he says\nin another place, “No man can come to me, except the Father draw\nhim.”[525] This passage is judiciously explained by Augustine in the\nfollowing words: “If, according to the declaration of truth, every one\nthat has learned comes, whosoever comes not, certainly has not learned.\nIt does not necessarily follow that he who can come actually comes,\nunless he has both willed and done it; but every one that has learned of\nthe Father, not only can come, but also actually comes; where there is\nan immediate union of the advantage of possibility, the inclination of\nthe will, and the consequent action.” In another place he is still\nclearer: “Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh\nunto me. Is not this saying, There is no one that hears and learns of\nthe Father, and comes not unto me? For if every one that has heard and\nlearned of the Father comes, certainly every one that comes not has\nneither heard nor learned of the Father; for if he had heard and\nlearned, he would come. Very remote from carnal observation is this\nschool, in which men hear and learn of the Father to come to the Son.”\nJust after he says, “This grace, which is secretly communicated to the\nhearts of men, is received by no hard heart; for the first object of its\ncommunication is, that hardness of heart may be taken away. When the\nFather is heard within therefore, he takes away the heart of stone, and\ngives a heart of flesh. For thus he forms children of promise and\nvessels of mercy whom he has prepared for glory. Why, then, does he not\nteach all, that they may come to Christ, but because all whom he\nteaches, he teaches in mercy? but whom he teaches not, he teaches not in\njudgment; for he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will\nhe hardeneth.” Those whom God has chosen, therefore, he designates as\nhis children, and determines himself to be their Father. By calling, he\nintroduces them into his family, and unites them to himself, that they\nmay be one. By connecting calling with election, the Scripture evidently\nsuggests that nothing is requisite to it but the free mercy of God. For\nif we inquire whom he calls, and for what reason, the answer is, those\nwhom he had elected. But when we come to election, we see nothing but\nmercy on every side. And so that observation of Paul is very applicable\nhere—“It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God\nthat showeth mercy;” but not as it is commonly understood by those who\nmake a distribution between the grace of God, and the will and exertion\nof man. For they say, that human desires and endeavours have no efficacy\nof themselves, unless they are rendered successful by the grace of God;\nbut maintain that, with the assistance of his blessing, these things\nhave also their share in procuring salvation. To refute their cavil, I\nprefer Augustine’s words to my own. “If the apostle only meant that it\nis not of him that wills, or of him that runs, without the assistance of\nthe merciful Lord, we may retort the converse proposition, that it is\nnot of mercy alone without the assistance of willing and running.” If\nthis be manifestly impious, we may be certain that the apostle ascribes\nevery thing to the Lord’s mercy, and leaves nothing to our wills or\nexertions. This was the opinion of that holy man. Nor is the least\nregard due to their paltry sophism, that Paul would not have expressed\nhimself so, if we had no exertion or will. For he considered not what\nwas in man; but seeing some persons attribute salvation partly to human\nindustry, he simply condemned their error in the former part of the\nsentence, and in the latter, vindicated the claim of Divine mercy to the\nwhole accomplishment of salvation. And what do the prophets, but\nperpetually proclaim the gratuitous calling of God?\nII. This point is further demonstrated by the very nature and\ndispensation of calling, which consists not in the mere preaching of the\nword, but in the accompanying illumination of the Spirit. To whom God\noffers his word, we are informed in the prophet: “I am sought of them\nthat asked not for me: I am found of them that sought me not: I said,\nBehold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my\nname.”[526] And lest the Jews should suppose that this clemency extended\nonly to the Gentiles, he recalls to their remembrance the situation from\nwhich he took their father Abraham, when he deigned to draw him to\nhimself; that was from the midst of idolatry, in which he and all his\nfamily were sunk.[527] When he first shines upon the undeserving with\nthe light of his word, he thereby exhibits a most brilliant specimen of\nhis free goodness. Here, then, the infinite goodness of God is\ndisplayed, but not to the salvation of all; for heavier judgment awaits\nthe reprobate, because they reject the testimony of Divine love. And God\nalso, to manifest his glory, withdraws from them the efficacious\ninfluence of his Spirit. This internal call, therefore, is a pledge of\nsalvation, which cannot possibly deceive. To this purpose is that\npassage of John—“Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit\nwhich he hath given us.”[528] And lest the flesh should glory in having\nanswered at least to his call, and accepted his free offers, he affirms\nthat men have no ears to hear, or eyes to see, but such as he has\nformed; and that he acts in this, not according to individual gratitude,\nbut according to his own election. Of this fact Luke gives us an eminent\nexample, where Jews and Gentiles in common heard the preaching of Paul\nand Barnabas. Though they were all instructed on that occasion with the\nsame discourse, it is narrated that “as many as were ordained to eternal\nlife, believed.”[529] With what face, then, can we deny the freeness of\ncalling, in which election reigns alone, even to the last?\nIII. Here two errors are to be avoided. For some suppose man to be a\ncoöperator with God, so that the validity of election depends on his\nconsent; thus, according to them, the will of man is superior to the\ncounsel of God. As though the Scripture taught, that we are only given\nan ability to believe, and not faith itself. Others, not thus enervating\nthe grace of the Holy Spirit, yet induced by I know not what mode of\nreasoning, suspend election on that which is subsequent to it; as though\nit were doubtful and ineffectual till it is confirmed by faith. That\nthis is its confirmation _to us_ is very clear; that it is the\nmanifestation of God’s secret counsel before concealed, we have already\nseen; but all that we are to understand by this, is that what was before\nunknown is verified, and as it were ratified with a seal. But it is\ncontrary to the truth to assert, that election has no efficacy till\nafter we have embraced the gospel, and that this circumstance gives it\nall its energy. The certainty of it, indeed, we are to seek here; for if\nwe attempt to penetrate to the eternal decree of God, we shall be\ningulfed in the profound abyss. But when God has discovered it to us, we\nmust ascend to loftier heights, that the cause may not be lost in the\neffect. For what can be more absurd and inconsistent, when the Scripture\nteaches that we are illuminated according as God has chosen us, than\nthat our eyes should be so dazzled with the blaze of this light as to\nrefuse to contemplate election? At the same time I admit that, in order\nto attain an assurance of our salvation, we ought to begin with the\nword, and that with it our confidence ought to be satisfied, so as to\ncall upon God as our Father. For some persons, to obtain certainty\nrespecting the counsel of God, “which is nigh unto us, in our mouth and\nin our heart,”[530] preposterously wish to soar above the clouds. Such\ntemerity, therefore, should be restrained by the sobriety of faith, that\nwe may be satisfied with the testimony of God in his external word\nrespecting his secret grace; only the channel, which conveys to us such\na copious stream to satisfy our thirst, must not deprive the\nfountain-head of the honour which belongs to it.\nIV. As it is erroneous, therefore, to suspend the efficacy of election\nupon the faith of the gospel, by which we discover our interest in\nelection, so we shall observe the best order, if, in seeking an\nassurance of our election, we confine our attention to those subsequent\nsigns which are certain attestations of it. Satan never attacks\nbelievers with a more grievous or dangerous temptation, than when he\ndisquiets them with doubts of their election, and stimulates to an\nimproper desire of seeking it in a wrong way. I call it seeking in a\nwrong way, when miserable man endeavours to force his way into the\nsecret recesses of Divine wisdom, and to penetrate even to the highest\neternity, that he may discover what is determined concerning him at the\ntribunal of God. Then he precipitates himself to be absorbed in the\nprofound of an unfathomable gulf; then he entangles himself in\nnumberless and inextricable snares; then he sinks himself in an abyss of\ntotal darkness. For it is right that the folly of the human mind should\nbe thus punished with horrible destruction, when it attempts by its own\nability to rise to the summit of Divine wisdom. This temptation is the\nmore fatal, because there is no other to which men in general have a\nstronger propensity. For there is scarcely a person to be found, whose\nmind is not sometimes struck with this thought—Whence can you obtain\nsalvation but from the election of God? And what revelation have you\nreceived of election? If this has once impressed a man, it either\nperpetually excruciates the unhappy being with dreadful torments, or\naltogether stupefies him with astonishment. Indeed, I should desire no\nstronger argument to prove how extremely erroneous the conceptions of\nsuch persons are respecting predestination, than experience itself;\nsince no error can affect the mind, more pestilent than such as disturbs\nthe conscience, and destroys its peace and tranquillity towards God.\nTherefore, if we dread shipwreck, let us anxiously beware of this rock,\non which none ever strike without being destroyed. But though the\ndiscussion of predestination may be compared to a dangerous ocean, yet,\nin traversing over it, the navigation is safe and serene, and I will\nalso add pleasant, unless any one freely wishes to expose himself to\ndanger. For as those who, in order to gain an assurance of their\nelection, examine into the eternal counsel of God without the word,\nplunge themselves into a fatal abyss, so they who investigate it in a\nregular and orderly manner, as it is contained in the word, derive from\nsuch inquiry the benefit of peculiar consolation. Let this, then, be our\nway of inquiry; to begin and end with the calling of God. Though this\nprevents not believers from perceiving, that the blessings they daily\nreceive from the hand of God descend from that secret adoption; as\nIsaiah introduces them, saying, “Thou hast done wonderful things; thy\ncounsels of old are faithfulness and truth;”[531] for by adoption, as by\na token, God chooses to confirm to us all that we are permitted to know\nof his counsel. Lest this should be thought a weak testimony, let us\nconsider how much clearness and certainty it affords us. Bernard has\nsome pertinent observations on this subject. After speaking of the\nreprobate, he says, “The counsel of God stands, the sentence of peace\nstands, respecting them who fear him, concealing their faults and\nrewarding their virtues; so that to them, not only good things, but evil\nones also, coöperate for good. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of\nGod’s elect? It is sufficient for me, for all righteousness, to possess\nhis favour alone, against whom alone I have sinned. All that he has\ndecreed not to impute to me, is just as if it had never been.” And a\nlittle after: “O place of true rest, which I might not improperly call a\nbed-chamber, in which God is viewed, not as disturbed with anger, or\nfilled with care, but where his will is proved to be good, and\nacceptable, and perfect. This view is not terrifying, but soothing; it\nexcites no restless curiosity, but allays it; it fatigues not the\nsenses, but tranquillizes them. Here true rest is enjoyed. A tranquil\nGod tranquillizes all things; and to behold rest, is to enjoy repose.”\nV. In the first place, if we seek the fatherly clemency and propitious\nheart of God, our eyes must be directed to Christ, in whom alone the\nFather is well pleased.[532] If we seek salvation, life, and the\nimmortality of the heavenly kingdom, recourse must be had to no other;\nfor he alone is the Fountain of life, the Anchor of salvation, and the\nHeir of the kingdom of heaven. Now, what is the end of election, but\nthat, being adopted as children by our heavenly Father, we may by his\nfavour obtain salvation and immortality? Consider and investigate it as\nmuch as you please, you will not find its ultimate scope extend beyond\nthis. The persons, therefore, whom God has adopted as his children, he\nis said to have chosen, not in themselves, but in Christ; because it was\nimpossible for him to love them, except in him; or to honour them with\nthe inheritance of his kingdom, unless previously made partakers of him.\nBut if we are chosen in him, we shall find no assurance of our election\nin ourselves; nor even in God the Father, considered alone, abstractedly\nfrom the Son. Christ, therefore, is the mirror, in which it behoves us\nto contemplate our election; and here we may do it with safety. For as\nthe Father has determined to unite to the body of his Son all who are\nthe objects of his eternal choice, that he may have, as his children,\nall that he recognizes among his members, we have a testimony\nsufficiently clear and strong, that if we have communion with Christ, we\nare written in the book of life. And he gave us this certain communion\nwith himself, when he testified by the preaching of the gospel, that he\nwas given to us by the Father, to be ours with all his benefits. We are\nsaid to put him on, and to grow up into him, that we may live because he\nlives. This doctrine is often repeated. “God spared not his only\nbegotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish.”[533]\n“He that believeth on him, is passed from death unto life.”[534] In\nwhich sense he calls himself “The bread of life, he that eateth which,\nshall live for ever.”[535] He, I say, is our witness, that all who\nreceive him by faith shall be considered as the children of his heavenly\nFather. If we desire any thing more than being numbered among the sons\nand heirs of God, we must rise above Christ. If this is our highest\nlimit, what folly do we betray in seeking out of him, that which we have\nalready obtained in him, and which can never be found any where else!\nBesides, as he is the Father’s eternal Wisdom, immutable Truth, and\ndetermined Counsel, we have no reason to fear the least variation in the\ndeclarations of his word from that will of the Father, which is the\nobject of our inquiry; indeed, he faithfully reveals it to us, as it has\nbeen from the beginning, and will ever continue to be. This doctrine\nought to have a practical influence on our prayers. For though faith in\nelection animates us to call upon God, yet it would be preposterous to\nobtrude it upon him when we pray, or to stipulate this condition—O Lord,\nif I am elected, hear me; since it is his pleasure that we should be\nsatisfied with his promises, and make no further inquiries whether he\nwill be propitious to our prayers. This prudence will extricate us from\nmany snares, if we know how to make a right use of what has been rightly\nwritten; but we must not inconsiderately apply to various purposes, what\nought to be restricted to the object particularly designed.\nVI. For the establishment of our confidence, there is also another\nconfirmation of election, which, we have said, is connected with our\ncalling. For those whom Christ illuminates with the knowledge of his\nname, and introduces into the bosom of his Church, he is said to receive\ninto his charge and protection. And all whom he receives are said to be\ncommitted and intrusted to him by the Father, to be kept to eternal\nlife. What do we wish for ourselves? Christ loudly proclaims that all\nwhose salvation was designed by the Father, had been delivered by him\ninto his protection.[536] If, therefore, we want to ascertain whether\nGod is concerned for our salvation, let us inquire whether he has\ncommitted us to Christ, whom he constituted the only Saviour of all his\npeople. Now, if we doubt whether Christ has received us into his charge\nand custody, he obviates this doubt, by freely offering himself as our\nShepherd, and declaring that if we hear his voice, we shall be numbered\namong his sheep. We therefore embrace Christ, thus kindly offered to us\nand advancing to meet us; and he will number us with his sheep, and\npreserve us enclosed in his fold. But yet we feel anxiety for our future\nstate; for as Paul declares that “whom he predestinated, them he also\ncalled,”[537] so Christ informs us that “many are called, but few\nchosen.”[538] Besides, Paul himself also, in another place, cautions\nagainst carelessness, saying, “Let him that thinketh he standeth, take\nheed lest he fall.”[539] Again: “Art thou grafted among the people of\nGod? Be not high-minded, but fear. God is able to cut thee off again,\nand graft in others.”[540] Lastly, experience itself teaches us that\nvocation and faith are of little value, unless accompanied by\nperseverance, which is not the lot of all. But Christ has delivered us\nfrom this anxiety, for these promises undoubtedly belong to the future:\n“All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to\nme, I will in no wise cast out. And this is the Father’s will which hath\nsent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but\nshould raise it up again at the last day.”[541] Again: “My sheep hear my\nvoice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give unto them eternal\nlife, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of\nmy hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and none is\nable to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.”[542] Besides, when he\ndeclares, “Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall\nbe rooted up,”[543] he fully implies on the contrary, that those who are\nrooted in God, can never by any violence be deprived of salvation. With\nthis corresponds that passage of John, “If they had been of us, they\nwould no doubt have continued with us.”[544] Hence also that magnificent\nexultation of Paul, in defiance of life and death, of things present and\nfuture; which must necessarily have been founded in the gift of\nperseverance.[545] Nor can it be doubted that he applies this sentiment\nto all the elect. The same apostle in another place says, “He which hath\nbegun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus\nChrist.”[546] This also supported David when his faith was failing:\n“Thou wilt not forsake the work of thine own hands.”[547] Nor is it to\nbe doubted, that when Christ intercedes for all the elect, he prays for\nthem the same as for Peter, that their faith may never fail. Hence we\nconclude, that they are beyond all danger of falling away, because the\nintercessions of the Son of God for their perseverance in piety have not\nbeen rejected. What did Christ intend we should learn from this, but\nconfidence in our perpetual security, since we have once been introduced\ninto the number of his people?\nVII. But it daily happens, that they who appeared to belong to Christ,\nfall away from him again, and sink into ruin. Even in that very place,\nwhere he asserts that none perish of those who were given to him by the\nFather, he excepts the son of perdition. This is true; but it is equally\ncertain, that such persons never adhered to Christ with that confidence\nof heart which, we say, gives us an assurance of our election. “They\nwent out from us,” says John, “but they were not of us; for if they had\nbeen of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.”[548] I dispute\nnot their having similar signs of calling with the elect; but I am far\nfrom admitting them to possess that certain assurance of election which\nI enjoin believers to seek from the word of the gospel. Wherefore, let\nnot such examples move us from a tranquil reliance on our Lord’s\npromise, where he declares, that all who receive him by faith were given\nhim by the Father, and that since he is their Guardian and Shepherd, not\none of them shall perish. Of Judas we shall speak afterwards. Paul is\ndissuading Christians, not from all security, but from supine,\nunguarded, carnal security, which is attended with pride, arrogance, and\ncontempt of others, extinguishes humility and reverence of God, and\nproduces forgetfulness of favours received. For he is addressing\nGentiles, teaching them that the Jews should not be proudly and\ninhumanly insulted because they had been rejected, and the Gentiles\nsubstituted in their place. He also inculcates fear; not such a fear as\nproduces terror and uncertainty, but such as teaches humble admiration\nof the grace of God, without any diminution of confidence in it; as has\nbeen elsewhere observed. Besides, he is not addressing individuals, but\ndistinct parties generally. For as the Church was divided into two\nparties, and emulation gave birth to dissension, Paul admonishes the\nGentiles, that their substitution in the place of the holy and peculiar\npeople ought to be a motive to fear and modesty. There were, however,\nmany clamorous people among them, whose empty boasting it was necessary\nto restrain. But we have already seen that our hope extends into\nfuturity, even beyond the grave, and that nothing is more contrary to\nits nature than doubts respecting our final destiny.\nVIII. The declaration of Christ, that “many are called, and few chosen,”\nis very improperly understood. For there will be no ambiguity in it, if\nwe remember what must be clear from the foregoing observations, that\nthere are two kinds of calling. For there is a universal call, by which\nGod, in the external preaching of the word, invites all,\nindiscriminately, to come to him, even those to whom he intends it as a\nsavour of death, and an occasion of heavier condemnation. There is also\na special call, with which he, for the most part, favours only\nbelievers, when, by the inward illumination of his Spirit, he causes the\nword preached to sink into their hearts. Yet sometimes he also\ncommunicates it to those whom he only enlightens for a season, and\nafterwards forsakes on account of their ingratitude, and strikes with\ngreater blindness. Now, the Lord, seeing the gospel published far and\nwide, held in contempt by the generality of men, and justly appreciated\nby few, gives us a description of God, under the character of a king,\nwho prepares a solemn feast, and sends out his messengers in every\ndirection, to invite a great company, but can only prevail on very few,\nevery one alleging impediments to excuse himself; so that at length he\nis constrained by their refusal to bring in all who can be found in the\nstreets. Thus far, every one sees, the parable is to be understood of\nthe external call. He proceeds to inform us, that God acts like a good\nmaster of a feast, walking round the tables, courteously receiving his\nguests; but that if he finds any one not adorned with a nuptial garment,\nhe suffers not the meanness of such a person to disgrace the festivity\nof the banquet. I confess, this part is to be understood of those who\nenter into the Church by a profession of faith, but are not invested\nwith the sanctification of Christ. Such blemishes, and, as it were,\ncankers of his Church, God will not always suffer, but will cast them\nout of it, as their turpitude deserves. Few, therefore, are chosen out\nof a multitude that are called, but not with that calling by which we\nsay believers ought to judge of their election. For the former is common\nalso to the wicked; but the latter is attended with the Spirit of\nregeneration, the earnest and seal of the future inheritance, which\nseals our hearts to the day of the Lord.[549] In short, though\nhypocrites boast of piety as if they were true worshippers of God,\nChrist declares that he will finally cast them out of the place which\nthey unjustly occupy. Thus the Psalmist says, “Who shall abide in thy\ntabernacle? He that worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his\nheart.”[550] Again: “This is the generation of them that seek him, that\nseek thy face, O Jacob.”[551] And thus the Spirit exhorts believers to\npatience, that they may not be disturbed by Ishmaelites being united\nwith them in the Church, since the mask will at length be torn off, and\nthey will be cast out with disgrace.\nIX. The same reasoning applies to the exception lately cited, where\nChrist says, that “none of them is lost, but the son of perdition.”[552]\nHere is, indeed, some inaccuracy of expression, but the meaning is\nclear. For he was never reckoned among the sheep of Christ, as being\nreally such, but only as he occupied the place of one. When the Lord\ndeclares he was chosen by himself with the other apostles, it only\nrefers to the ministerial office. “Have not I chosen you twelve,” says\nhe, “and one of you is a devil?”[553] That is, he had chosen him to the\noffice of an apostle. But when he speaks of election to salvation, he\nexcludes him from the number of the elect: “I speak not of you all; I\nknow whom I have chosen.”[554] If any one confound the term _election_\nin these passages, he will miserably embarrass himself; if he make a\nproper distinction, nothing is plainer. It is therefore a very erroneous\nand pernicious assertion of Gregory, that we are only conscious of our\ncalling, but uncertain of our election; from which he exhorts all to\nfear and trembling, using also this argument, that though we know what\nwe are to-day, yet we know not what we may be in future. But the context\nplainly shows the cause of his error on this point. For as he suspended\nelection on the merit of works, this furnished abundant reason for\ndiscouragement to the minds of men: he could never establish them, for\nwant of leading them from themselves to a confidence in the Divine\ngoodness. Hence believers have some perception of what we stated at the\nbeginning, that predestination, rightly considered, neither destroys nor\nweakens faith, but rather furnishes its best confirmation. Yet I will\nnot deny, that the Spirit sometimes accommodates his language to the\nlimited extent of our capacity, as when he says, “They shall not be in\nthe assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing\nof the house of Israel.”[555] As though God were beginning to write in\nthe book of life those whom he numbers among his people, whereas we know\nfrom the testimony of Christ, that the names of God’s children have been\nwritten in the book of life from the beginning.[556] But these\nexpressions only signify the rejection of those who seemed to be the\nchief among the elect; as the Psalmist says, “Let them be blotted out of\nthe book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.”[557]\nX. Now, the elect are not gathered into the fold of Christ by calling,\nimmediately from their birth, nor all at the same time, but according as\nGod is pleased to dispense his grace to them. Before they are gathered\nto that chief Shepherd, they go astray, scattered in the common\nwilderness, and differing in no respect from others, except in being\nprotected by the special mercy of God from rushing down the precipice of\neternal death. If you observe them, therefore, you will see the\nposterity of Adam partaking of the common corruption of the whole\nspecies. That they go not to the most desperate extremes of impiety, is\nnot owing to any innate goodness of theirs, but because the eye of God\nwatches over them, and his hand is extended for their preservation. For\nthose who dream of I know not what seed of election sown in their hearts\nfrom their very birth, always inclining them to piety and the fear of\nGod, are unsupported by the authority of Scripture, and refuted by\nexperience itself. They produce, indeed, a few examples to prove that\ncertain elect persons were not entire strangers to religion, even before\nthey were truly enlightened; that Paul lived blameless in his\nPharisaism;[558] that Cornelius, with his alms and prayers, was accepted\nof God,[559] and if there are any other similar ones. What they say of\nPaul, we admit; but respecting Cornelius, we maintain that they are\ndeceived; for it is evident, he was then enlightened and regenerated,\nand wanted nothing but a clear revelation of the gospel. But what will\nthey extort from these very few examples? that the elect have always\nbeen endued with the spirit of piety? This is just as if any one, having\nproved the integrity of Aristides, Socrates, Xenocrates, Scipio, Curius,\nCamillus, and other heathens, should conclude from this, that all who\nwere left in the darkness of idolatry, were followers of holiness and\nvirtue. But this is contradicted in many passages of Scripture. Paul’s\ndescription of the state of the Ephesians prior to regeneration,\nexhibits not a grain of this seed. “Ye were dead,” he says, “in\ntrespasses and sins, wherein in time past ye walked according to the\ncourse of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air,\nthe spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience; among whom\nalso we all had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of our\nflesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by\nnature the children of wrath, even as others.”[560] Again: “Remember\nthat at that time ye were without hope, and without God in the\nworld.”[561] Again: “Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in\nthe Lord; walk as children of light.”[562] But perhaps they will plead,\nthat these passages refer to that ignorance of the true God, in which\nthey acknowledge the elect to be involved previously to their calling.\nThough this would be an impudent cavil, since the apostle’s inferences\nfrom them are such as these: “Put away lying; and let him that stole,\nsteal no more.”[563] But what will they reply to other passages? such as\nthat where, after declaring to the Corinthians, that “Neither\nfornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers\nof themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,\nnor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God;” he\nimmediately adds, “And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye\nare sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and\nby the Spirit of our God.”[564] And another passage, addressed to the\nRomans: “As ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness, and to\niniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to\nrighteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now\nashamed?”[565]\nXI. What kind of seed of election was springing up in them, who were all\ntheir lives contaminated with various pollutions, and with desperate\nwickedness wallowed in the most nefarious and execrable of all crimes?\nIf he had intended to speak according to these teachers, he ought to\nhave shown how much they were obliged to the goodness of God, which had\npreserved them from falling into such great pollutions. So likewise the\npersons whom Peter addressed, he ought to have exhorted to gratitude on\naccount of the perpetual seed of election. But, on the contrary, he\nadmonishes them, “that the time past may suffice to have wrought the\nwill of the Gentiles.”[566] What if we come to particular examples? What\nprinciple of righteousness was there in Rahab the harlot before\nfaith?[567] in Manasseh, when Jerusalem was dyed, and almost drowned,\nwith the blood of the prophets?[568] in the thief, who repented in his\ndying moments?[569] Away, then, with these arguments, which men of\npresumptuous curiosity raise to themselves without regarding the\nScripture. Let us rather abide by the declaration of the Scripture, that\n“all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own\nway,”[570] that is, destruction. Those whom the Lord has determined to\nrescue from this gulf of perdition, he defers till his appointed season;\nbefore which he only preserves them from falling into unpardonable\nblasphemy.\nXII. As the Lord, by his effectual calling of the elect, completes the\nsalvation to which he predestinated them in his eternal counsel, so he\nhas his judgments against the reprobate, by which he executes his\ncounsel respecting them. Those, therefore, whom he has created to a life\nof shame and a death of destruction, that they might be instruments of\nhis wrath, and examples of his severity, he causes to reach their\nappointed end, sometimes depriving them of the opportunity of hearing\nthe word, sometimes, by the preaching of it, increasing their blindness\nand stupidity. Of the former there are innumerable examples: let us only\nselect one that is more evident and remarkable than the rest. Before the\nadvent of Christ, there passed about four thousand years, in which the\nLord concealed the light of the doctrine of salvation from all the\nGentiles. If it be replied, that he withheld from them the participation\nof so great a blessing because he esteemed them unworthy, their\nposterity will be found equally unworthy of it. The truth of this, to\nsay nothing of experience, is sufficiently attested by Malachi, who\nfollows his reproofs of unbelief and gross blasphemies by an immediate\nprediction of the coming of the Messiah. Why, then, is he given to the\nposterity rather than to their ancestors? He will torment himself in\nvain, who seeks for any cause of this beyond the secret and inscrutable\ncounsel of God. Nor need we be afraid lest any disciple of Porphyry\nshould be imboldened to calumniate the justice of God by our silence in\nits defence. For while we assert that all deserve to perish, and it is\nof God’s free goodness that any are saved, enough is said for the\nillustration of his glory, so that every subterfuge of ours is\naltogether unnecessary. The supreme Lord, therefore, by depriving of the\ncommunication of his light, and leaving in darkness, those whom he has\nreprobated, makes way for the accomplishment of his predestination. Of\nthe second class, the Scriptures contain many examples, and others\npresent themselves every day. The same sermon is addressed to a hundred\npersons; twenty receive it with the obedience of faith; the others\ndespise, or ridicule, or reject, or condemn it. If it be replied, that\nthe difference proceeds from their wickedness and perverseness, this\nwill afford no satisfaction; because the minds of others would have been\ninfluenced by the same wickedness, but for the correction of Divine\ngoodness. And thus we shall always be perplexed, unless we recur to\nPaul’s question—“Who maketh thee to differ?”[571] In which he signifies,\nthat the excellence of some men beyond others, is not from their own\nvirtue, but solely from Divine grace.\nXIII. Why, then, in bestowing grace upon some, does he pass over others?\nLuke assigns a reason for the former, that they “were ordained to\neternal life.” What conclusion, then, shall we draw respecting the\nlatter, but that they are vessels of wrath to dishonour? Wherefore let\nus not hesitate to say with Augustine, “God could convert to good the\nwill of the wicked, because he is omnipotent. It is evident that he\ncould. Why, then, does he not? Because he would not. Why he would not,\nremains with himself.” For we ought not to aim at more wisdom than\nbecomes us. That will be much better than adopting the evasion of\nChrysostom, “that he draws those who are willing, and who stretch out\ntheir hands for his aid;” that the difference may not appear to consist\nin the decree of God, but wholly in the will of man. But an approach to\nhim is so far from being a mere effort of man, that even pious persons,\nand such as fear God, still stand in need of the peculiar impulse of the\nSpirit. Lydia, the seller of purple, feared God, and yet it was\nnecessary that her heart should be opened, to attend to, and profit by,\nthe doctrine of Paul. This declaration is not made respecting a single\nfemale, but in order to teach us that every one’s advancement in piety\nis the secret work of the Spirit. It is a fact not to be doubted, that\nGod sends his word to many whose blindness he determines shall be\nincreased. For with what design does he direct so many commands to be\ndelivered to Pharaoh? Was it from an expectation that his heart would be\nsoftened by repeated and frequent messages? Before he began, he knew and\nforetold the result. He commanded Moses to go and declare his will to\nPharaoh, adding at the same time, “But I will harden his heart, that he\nshall not let the people go.”[572] So, when he calls forth Ezekiel, he\napprizes him that he is sending him to a rebellious and obstinate\npeople, that he may not be alarmed if they refuse to hear him.[573] So\nJeremiah foretells that his word will be like fire, to scatter and\ndestroy the people like stubble.[574] But the prophecy of Isaiah\nfurnishes a still stronger confirmation; for this is his mission from\nthe Lord: “Go and tell this people, Hear ye, indeed, but understand not,\nand see ye, indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat,\nand make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their\neyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and\nconvert, and be healed.”[575] Observe, he directs his voice to them, but\nit is that they may become more deaf; he kindles a light, but it is that\nthey may be made more blind; he publishes his doctrine, but it is that\nthey may be more besotted; he applies a remedy, but it is that they may\nnot be healed. John, citing this prophecy, declares that the Jews could\nnot believe, because this curse of God was upon them.[576] Nor can it be\ndisputed, that to such persons as God determines not to enlighten, he\ndelivers his doctrine involved in enigmatical obscurity, that its only\neffect may be to increase their stupidity. For Christ testifies that he\nconfined to his apostles the explanations of the parables in which he\nhad addressed the multitude; “because to you it is given to know the\nmysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.”[577]\nWhat does the Lord mean, you will say, by teaching those by whom he\ntakes care not to be understood? Consider whence the fault arises, and\nyou will cease the inquiry; for whatever obscurity there is in the word,\nyet there is always light enough to convince the consciences of the\nwicked.\nXIV. It remains now to be seen why the Lord does that which it is\nevident he does. If it be replied, that this is done because men have\ndeserved it by their impiety, wickedness, and ingratitude, it will be a\njust and true observation; but as we have not yet discovered the reason\nof this diversity, why some persist in obduracy while others are\ninclined to obedience, the discussion of it will necessarily lead us to\nthe same remark that Paul has quoted from Moses concerning Pharaoh:\n“Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my\npower in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the\nearth.”[578] That the reprobate obey not the word of God, when made\nknown to them, is justly imputed to the wickedness and depravity of\ntheir hearts, provided it be at the same time stated, that they are\nabandoned to this depravity, because they have been raised up, by a just\nbut inscrutable judgment of God, to display his glory in their\ncondemnation. So, when it is related of the sons of Eli, that they\nlistened not to his salutary admonitions, “because the Lord would slay\nthem,”[579] it is not denied that their obstinacy proceeded from their\nown wickedness, but it is plainly implied that though the Lord was able\nto soften their hearts, yet they were left in their obstinacy, because\nhis immutable decree had predestinated them to destruction. To the same\npurpose is that passage of John, “Though he had done so many miracles\nbefore them, yet they believed not on him; that the saying of Esaias the\nprophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, ‘Lord, who hath believed our\nreport?’”[580] For though he does not acquit the obstinate from the\ncharge of guilt, yet he satisfies himself with this reason, that the\ngrace of God has no charms for men till the Holy Spirit gives them a\ntaste for it. And Christ cites the prophecy of Isaiah, “They shall be\nall taught of God,”[581] with no other design than to show, that the\nJews are reprobate and strangers to the Church, because they are\ndestitute of docility; and he adduces no other reason for it than that\nthe promise of God does not belong to them; which is confirmed by that\npassage of Paul, where “Christ crucified, unto the Jews a\nstumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness,” is said to be “unto\nthem which are called, the power of God, and the wisdom of God.”[582]\nFor, after remarking what generally happens whenever the gospel is\npreached, that it exasperates some, and is despised by others, he\nrepresents it as duly appreciated only by “those who are called.” A\nlittle before he had mentioned “them that believe;” not that he had an\nintention to deny its proper place to the grace of God, which precedes\nfaith, but he seems to add this second description by way of correction,\nin order that those who had received the gospel might ascribe the praise\nof their faith to the Divine call. And so, likewise, in a subsequent\nsentence, he represents them as the objects of Divine election. When the\nimpious hear these things, they loudly complain that God, by a wanton\nexercise of power, abuses his wretched creatures for the sport of his\ncruelty. But we, who know that all men are liable to so many charges at\nthe Divine tribunal, that of a thousand questions they would be unable\nto give a satisfactory answer to one, confess that the reprobate suffer\nnothing but what is consistent with the most righteous judgment of God.\nThough we cannot comprehend the reason of this, let us be content with\nsome degree of ignorance where the wisdom of God soars into its own\nsublimity.\nXV. But as objections are frequently raised from some passages of\nScripture, in which God seems to deny that the destruction of the wicked\nis caused by his decree, but that, in opposition to his remonstrances,\nthey voluntarily bring ruin upon themselves,—let us show by a brief\nexplication that they are not at all inconsistent with the foregoing\ndoctrine. A passage is produced from Ezekiel, where God says, “I have no\npleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his\nway and live.”[583] If this is to be extended to all mankind, why does\nhe not urge many to repentance, whose minds are more flexible to\nobedience than those of others, who grow more and more callous to his\ndaily invitations? Among the inhabitants of Nineveh and Sodom, Christ\nhimself declares that his evangelical preaching and miracles would have\nbrought forth more fruit than in Judea. How is it, then, if God will\nhave all men to be saved, that he opens not the gate of repentance to\nthose miserable men who would be more ready to receive the favour? Hence\nwe perceive it to be a violent perversion of the passage, if the will of\nGod, mentioned by the prophet, be set in opposition to his eternal\ncounsel, by which he has distinguished the elect from the reprobate.\nNow, if we inquire the genuine sense of the prophet, his only meaning is\nto inspire the penitent with hopes of pardon. And this is the sum, that\nit is beyond a doubt that God is ready to pardon sinners immediately on\ntheir conversion. Therefore he wills not their death, inasmuch as he\nwills their repentance. But experience teaches, that he does not will\nthe repentance of those whom he externally calls, in such a manner as to\naffect all their hearts. Nor should he on this account be charged with\nacting deceitfully; for, though his external call only renders those who\nhear without obeying it inexcusable, yet it is justly esteemed the\ntestimony of God’s grace, by which he reconciles men to himself. Let us\nobserve, therefore, the design of the prophet in saying that God has no\npleasure in the death of a sinner; it is to assure the pious of God’s\nreadiness to pardon them immediately on their repentance, and to show\nthe impious the aggravation of their sin in rejecting such great\ncompassion and kindness of God. Repentance, therefore, will always be\nmet by Divine mercy; but on whom repentance is bestowed, we are clearly\ntaught by Ezekiel himself, as well as by all the prophets and apostles.\nXVI. Another passage adduced is from Paul, where he states that “God\nwill have all men to be saved;”[584] which, though somewhat different\nfrom the passage just considered, yet is very similar to it. I reply, in\nthe first place, that it is evident from the context, how God wills the\nsalvation of all; for Paul connects these two things together, that he\n“will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the\ntruth.” If it was fixed in the eternal counsel of God, that they should\nreceive the doctrine of salvation, what is the meaning of that question\nof Moses, “What nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them\nas we have?”[585] How is it that God has deprived many nations of the\nlight of the gospel, which others enjoyed? How is it that the pure\nknowledge of the doctrine of piety has never reached some, and that\nothers have but just heard some obscure rudiments of it? Hence it will\nbe easy to discover the design of Paul. He had enjoined Timothy to make\nsolemn prayers in the Church for kings and princes; but as it might seem\nsomewhat inconsistent to pray to God for a class of men almost past\nhope,—for they were not only strangers to the body of Christ, but\nstriving with all their power to ruin his kingdom,—he subjoins, that\n“this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, who will have all men\nto be saved;” which only imports, that God has not closed the way of\nsalvation against any order of men, but has diffused his mercy in such a\nmanner that he would have no rank to be destitute of it. The other texts\nadduced are not declarative of the Lord’s determination respecting all\nmen in his secret counsel: they only proclaim that pardon is ready for\nall sinners who sincerely seek it.[586] For if they obstinately insist\non its being said that God is merciful to all, I will oppose to them,\nwhat is elsewhere asserted, that “our God is in the heavens; he hath\ndone whatsoever he hath pleased.”[587] This text, then, must be\nexplained in a manner consistent with another, where God says, “I will\nbe gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show mercy on whom I\nwill show mercy.”[588] He who makes a selection of objects for the\nexercise of his mercy, does not impart that mercy to all. But as it\nclearly appears that Paul is there speaking, not of individuals, but\norders of men, I shall forbear any further argument. It must be\nremarked, however, that Paul is not declaring the actual conduct of God\nat all times, in all places, and to all persons, but merely representing\nhim as at liberty to make kings and magistrates at length partakers of\nthe heavenly doctrine, notwithstanding their present rage against it in\nconsequence of their blindness. There is more apparent plausibility in\ntheir objection, from the declaration of Peter, that “the Lord is not\nwilling that any should perish, but that all should come to\nrepentance.”[589] But the second clause furnishes an immediate solution\nof this difficulty; for the willingness that they should come to\nrepentance must be understood in consistence with the general tenor of\nScripture. Conversion is certainly in the power of God; let him be\nasked, whether he wills the conversion of all, when he promises a few\nindividuals to give them “a heart of flesh,” while he leaves others with\n“a heart of stone.”[590] If he were not ready to receive those who\nimplore his mercy, there would indeed be no propriety in this address,\n“Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto you;”[591] but I maintain that no\nmortal ever approaches God without being divinely drawn. But if\nrepentance depended on the will of man, Paul would not have said, “If\nGod peradventure will give them repentance.”[592] And if God, whose\nvoice exhorts all men to repentance, did not draw the elect to it by the\nsecret operation of his Spirit, Jeremiah would not have said, “Turn thou\nme, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after\nthat I was turned, I repented.”[593]\nXVII. If this be correct, it will be said there can be but little faith\nin the promises of the gospel, which, in declaring the will of God,\nassert that he wills what is repugnant to his inviolable decree. But\nthis is far from a just conclusion. For if we turn our attention to the\neffect of the promises of salvation, we shall find that their\nuniversality is not at all inconsistent with the predestination of the\nreprobate. We know the promises to be effectual to us only when we\nreceive them by faith; on the contrary, the annihilation of faith is at\nonce an abolition of the promises. If this is their nature, we may\nperceive that there is no discordance between these two things—God’s\nhaving appointed from eternity on whom he will bestow his favour and\nexercise his wrath, and his proclaiming salvation indiscriminately to\nall. Indeed, I maintain that there is the most perfect harmony between\nthem. For his sole design in thus promising, is to offer his mercy to\nall who desire and seek it, which none do but those whom he has\nenlightened, and he enlightens all whom he has predestinated to\nsalvation. These persons experience the certain and unshaken truth of\nthe promises; so that it cannot be pretended that there is the least\ncontrariety between God’s eternal election and the testimony of his\ngrace offered to believers. But why does he mention all? It is in order\nthat the consciences of the pious may enjoy the more secure\nsatisfaction, seeing that there is no difference between sinners,\nprovided they have faith; and, on the other hand, that the impious may\nnot plead the want of an asylum to flee to from the bondage of sin,\nwhile they ungratefully reject that which is offered to them. When the\nmercy of God is offered to both by the gospel, it is faith, that is, the\nillumination of God, which distinguishes between the pious and impious;\nso that the former experience the efficacy of the gospel, but the latter\nderive no benefit from it. Now, this illumination is regulated by God’s\neternal election. The complaint and lamentation of Christ, “O Jerusalem,\nJerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children together, and ye\nwould not,”[594] however they cite it, affords them no support. I\nconfess, that Christ here speaks not merely in his human character, but\nthat he is upbraiding the Jews for having in all ages rejected his\ngrace. But we must define the will of God which is here intended. It is\nwell known how sedulously God laboured to preserve that people to\nhimself, and with what extreme obstinacy, from the first to the last,\nthey refused to be gathered, being abandoned to their own wandering\ndesires; but this does not authorize the conclusion, that the counsel of\nGod was frustrated by the wickedness of men. They object, that nothing\nis more inconsistent with the nature of God than to have two wills. This\nI grant them, provided it be rightly explained. But why do they not\nconsider the numerous passages, where, by the assumption of human\naffections, God condescends beneath his own majesty? He says, “I have\nspread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people;”[595] early\nand late endeavouring to bring them to himself. If they are determined\nto accommodate all this to God, and disregard the figurative mode of\nexpression, they will give rise to many needless contentions, which may\nbe settled by this one solution, that what is peculiar to man is\ntransferred to God. The solution, however, elsewhere stated by us, is\nfully sufficient—that though to our apprehension the will of God is\nmanifold and various, yet he does not in himself will things at variance\nwith each other, but astonishes our faculties with his various and\n“manifold wisdom,” according to the expression of Paul, till we shall be\nenabled to understand, that he mysteriously wills what now seems\ncontrary to his will. They impertinently object, that God being the\nFather of all, it is unjust for him to disinherit any but such as have\npreviously deserved this punishment by their own guilt. As if the\ngoodness of God did not extend even to dogs and swine. But if the\nquestion relates to the human race, let them answer why God allied\nhimself to one people as their Father; why he gathered even from them\nbut a very small number, as the flower of them. But their rage for\nslander prevents these railers from considering that God “maketh his sun\nto rise on the evil and on the good,”[596] but that the inheritance is\nreserved for the few, to whom it shall one day be said, “Come, ye\nblessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\nfoundation of the world.”[597] They further object, that God hates\nnothing he has made; which though I grant them, the doctrine I maintain\nstill remains unshaken, that the reprobate are hated by God, and that\nmost justly, because, being destitute of his Spirit, they can do nothing\nbut what is deserving of his curse. They further allege, that there is\nno difference between the Jew and the Gentile, and therefore that the\ngrace of God is offered indiscriminately to all: I grant it; only let\nthem admit, according to the declaration of Paul, that God calls whom he\npleases, both of the Jews and of the Gentiles,[598] so that he is under\nno obligation to any. In this way also we answer their arguments from\nanother text, which says, that “God hath concluded them all in unbelief,\nthat he might have mercy upon all;”[599] which imports that he will have\nthe salvation of all who are saved ascribed to his mercy, though this\nblessing is not common to all. Now, while many arguments are advanced on\nboth sides, let our conclusion be to stand astonished with Paul at so\ngreat a mystery, and amidst the clamour of petulant tongues let us not\nbe ashamed of exclaiming with him, “O man, who art thou that repliest\nagainst God?” For, as Augustine justly contends, it is acting a most\nperverse part, to set up the measure of human justice as the standard by\nwhich to measure the justice of God.\nFootnote 521:\nRom. viii. 29, 30.\nFootnote 522:\nRom viii. 15, 16.

          "title": "CHAPTER XXV.",
          "content": "THE FINAL RESURRECTION.\nThough Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, after having “abolished death,”\nis declared by Paul to have “brought life and immortality to light,”\nshining upon us “through the gospel,”[600] whence also in believing we\nare said to have “passed from death unto life,”[601] being “no more\nstrangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of\nthe household of God,”[602] who “hath made us sit together in heavenly\nplaces” with his only begotten Son,[603] that nothing may be wanting to\nour complete felicity,—yet, lest we should find it grievous to be still\nexercised with a severe warfare, as though we derived no benefit from\nthe victory gained by Christ, we must remember what is stated in another\nplace concerning the nature of hope. For “since we hope for that we see\nnot,”[604] and, according to another text, “faith is the evidence of\nthings not seen;”[605] as long as we are confined in the prison of the\nflesh, “we are absent from the Lord.”[606] Wherefore the same apostle\nsays, “Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God;” and “when\nChrist, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with\nhim in glory.”[607] This, then, is our condition, “that we should live\nsoberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world, looking for that\nblessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our\nSaviour Jesus Christ.”[608] Here we have need of more than common\npatience, lest, being wearied, we pursue a retrograde course, or desert\nthe station assigned us. All that has hitherto been stated, therefore,\nconcerning our salvation, requires minds elevated towards heaven, that,\naccording to the suggestion of Peter, we may love Christ, whom we have\nnot seen, and, believing in him, may “rejoice with joy unspeakable and\nfull of glory,” till we receive “the end of our faith.”[609] For which\nreason, Paul represents the faith and hope of believers as having\nrespect to “the hope that is laid up in heaven.”[610] When we are thus\nlooking towards heaven, with our eyes fixed upon Christ, and nothing\ndetains them on earth from carrying us forward to the promised\nblessedness, we realize the fulfilment of that declaration, “Where your\ntreasure is, there will your heart be also.”[611] Hence it is, that\nfaith is so scarce in the world; because to our sluggishness nothing is\nmore difficult than to ascend through innumerable obstacles, “pressing\ntoward the mark, for the prize of the high calling.”[612] To the\naccumulation of miseries which generally oppress us, are added the\nmockeries of the profane, with which our simplicity is assailed; while\nvoluntarily renouncing the allurements of present advantage or pleasure,\nwe seem to pursue happiness, which is concealed from our view, like a\nshadow that continually eludes our grasp. In a word, above and below,\nbefore and behind, we are beset by violent temptations, which our minds\nwould long ago have been incapable of sustaining, if they had not been\ndetached from terrestrial things, and attached to the heavenly life,\nwhich is apparently at a remote distance. He alone, therefore, has made\na solid proficiency in the gospel who has been accustomed to continual\nmeditation on the blessed resurrection.\nII. The supreme good was a subject of anxious dispute, and even\ncontention, among the ancient philosophers; yet none of them, except\nPlato, acknowledged the chief good of man to consist in his union with\nGod. But of the nature of this union he had not even the smallest idea;\nand no wonder, for he was totally uninformed respecting the sacred bond\nof it. We know what is the only and perfect happiness even in this\nearthly pilgrimage; but it daily inflames our hearts with increasing\ndesires after it, till we shall be satisfied with its full fruition.\nTherefore I have observed that the advantage of Christ’s benefits is\nsolely enjoyed by those who elevate their minds to the resurrection.\nThus Paul also sets before believers this object, towards which he tells\nus he directs all his own efforts, forgetting every thing else, “if by\nany means he may attain unto it.”[613] And it behoves us to press\nforward to the same point with the greater alacrity, lest, if this world\nengross our attention, we should be grievously punished for our sloth.\nHe therefore characterizes believers by this mark, “Our conversation is\nin heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour.”[614] And that\ntheir minds may not flag in this course, he associates with them all\ncreatures as their companions. For as ruin and deformity are visible on\nevery side, he tells us that all things in heaven and earth are tending\nto renovation. For the fall of Adam having deranged the perfect order of\nnature, the bondage to which the creatures have been subjected by the\nsin of man is grievous and burdensome to them; not that they are endued\nwith any intelligence, but because they naturally aspire to the state of\nperfection from which they have fallen. Paul therefore attributes to\nthem groaning and travailing pains,[615] that we who have received the\nfirst-fruits of the Spirit may be ashamed of remaining in our\ncorruption, and not imitating at least the inanimate elements which bear\nthe punishment of the sin of others. But as a still stronger stimulus to\nus, he calls the second advent of Christ “our redemption.” It is true,\nindeed, that all the parts of our redemption are already completed; but\nbecause “Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, he shall\nappear the second time without sin unto salvation.”[616] Whatever\ncalamities oppress us, this redemption should support us even till its\nfull consummation.\nIII. Let the importance of the object sharpen our pursuit. Paul justly\nargues, that “if there be no resurrection of the dead,” the whole gospel\nis vain and fallacious; for we should be “of all men the most\nmiserable,” being exposed to the hatred and reproaches of mankind,\n“standing in jeopardy every hour,”[617] and being even like sheep\ndestined to the slaughter; and therefore its authority would fall to the\nground not in one point only, but in every thing it contains relating to\nadoption and the accomplishment of our salvation. To this subject, the\nmost important of all, let us give an attention never to be wearied by\nlength of time. With this view I have deferred what I shall briefly say\nof it to this place, that the reader, after receiving Christ as the\nAuthor of complete salvation, may learn to soar higher, and may know\nthat he is invested with heavenly glory and immortality, in order that\nthe whole body may be conformed to the Head; as in his person the Holy\nSpirit frequently gives an example of the resurrection. It is a thing\ndifficult to be believed, that bodies, after having been consumed by\ncorruption, shall at length, at the appointed time, be raised again.\nTherefore, while many of the philosophers asserted the immortality of\nthe soul, the resurrection of the body was admitted by few. And though\nthis furnishes no excuse, yet it admonishes us that this truth is too\ndifficult to command the assent of the human mind. To enable faith to\nsurmount so great an obstacle, the Scripture supplies us with two\nassistances: one consists in the similitude of Christ, the other in the\nomnipotence of God. Now, whenever the resurrection is mentioned, let us\nset before us the image of Christ, who, in our nature, which he assumed,\nfinished his course in this mortal life in such a manner, that, having\nnow obtained immortality, he is the pledge of future resurrection to us.\nFor in the afflictions that befall us, “we bear about in the body the\ndying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made\nmanifest in our body.”[618] And to separate him from us, is not lawful,\nnor indeed possible, without rending him asunder. Hence the reasoning of\nPaul: “If there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not\nrisen;”[619] for he assumes this as an acknowledged principle, that\nChrist neither fell under the power of death, nor triumphed over it in\nhis resurrection, for himself as a private individual; but that all this\nwas a commencement in the Head of what must be fulfilled in all the\nmembers, according to every one’s order and degree. For it would not be\nright, indeed, for them to be in all respects equal to him. It is said\nin the Psalms, “Thou wilt not suffer thine Holy One to see\ncorruption.”[620] Though a portion of this confidence belongs to us,\naccording to the measure bestowed upon us, yet the perfect\naccomplishment has been seen in Christ alone, who had his body restored\nto him entire, free from all corruption. Now that we may have no doubt\nof our fellowship with Christ in his blessed resurrection, and may be\nsatisfied with this pledge, Paul expressly affirms that the design of\nhis session in heaven, and his advent in the character of Judge at the\nlast day, is to “change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like\nunto his glorious body.”[621] In another place also, he shows that God\nraised his Son from the dead, not in order to display a single specimen\nof his power, but to exert on believers the same energy of his Spirit,\nwhom he therefore calls “our life” while he dwells in us, because he was\ngiven for this very purpose, “to quicken our mortal bodies.”[622] I am\nbut briefly glancing at things which would admit of a fuller discussion,\nand are deserving of more elegance of style; but I trust the pious\nreader will find in a small compass sufficient matter for the\nedification of his faith. Christ, therefore, rose again, that we might\nbe the companions of his future life. He was raised by the Father,\ninasmuch as he was the Head of the church, from which he does not suffer\nhim to be separated. He was raised by the power of the Spirit, who is\ngiven to us also for the purpose of quickening us. In a word, he was\nraised that he might be “the resurrection and the life.” But as we have\nobserved that this mirror exhibits to us a lively image of our\nresurrection, so it will furnish a firm foundation for our minds to rest\nupon, provided we are not wearied or disturbed by the long delay;\nbecause it is not ours to measure the moments of time by our own\ninclination, but to wait patiently for God’s establishment of his\nkingdom in his own appointed time. To this purpose is the expression of\nPaul, “Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ’s at his\ncoming.”[623] But that no doubt might be entertained of the resurrection\nof Christ, on which the resurrection of us all is founded, we see in how\nmany and various ways he has caused it to be attested to us. Scorners\nwill ridicule the history narrated by the evangelists, as a childish\nmockery. For what weight, they ask, is there in the message brought by\nsome women in a fright, and afterwards confirmed by the disciples half\ndead with fear? Why does not Christ rather set up the splendid trophies\nof his victory in the midst of the temple and the public places? Why\ndoes he not make a formidable entrance into the presence of Pilate? Why\ndoes he not prove himself to be again alive, to the priests and all the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem? Profane men will scarcely believe the persons\nselected by him to be competent witnesses. I reply, notwithstanding the\ncontemptible weakness evident in these beginnings, yet all this was\nconducted by the admirable providence of God, that they who were lately\ndispirited with fear, were hurried away to the sepulchre, partly by love\nto Christ and pious zeal, partly by their own unbelief, not only to be\neye-witnesses of the fact, but to hear from the angels the same as they\nsaw with their eyes. How can we suspect the authority of those who\nconsidered what they heard from the women “as idle tales,” till they had\nthe fact clearly before them?[624] As to the people at large, and the\ngovernor himself, it is no wonder that after the ample conviction they\nhad, they were denied a sight of Christ, or any other proofs. The\nsepulchre is sealed, a watch is set, the body is not found on the third\nday. The soldiers, corrupted by bribes, circulate a rumour that he was\nstolen away by his disciples;[625] as if they had power to collect a\nstrong force, or were furnished with arms, or were even accustomed to\nsuch a daring exploit. But if the soldiers had not courage enough to\nrepulse them, why did they not pursue them, that with the assistance of\nthe people they might seize some of them? The truth is, therefore, that\nPilate by his zeal attested the resurrection of Christ; and the guards\nwho were placed at the sepulchre, either by their silence or by their\nfalsehood, were in reality so many heralds to publish the same fact. In\nthe mean time, the voice of the angels loudly proclaimed, “He is not\nhere, but is risen.”[626] Their celestial splendour evidently showed\nthem to be angels, and not men. After this, if there was any doubt still\nremaining, it was removed by Christ himself. More than once, his\ndisciples saw, and even felt and handled him; and their unbelief has\neminently contributed to the confirmation of our faith. He discoursed\namong them concerning the mysteries of the kingdom of God, and at length\nthey saw him ascend to heaven.[627] Nor was this spectacle exhibited\nonly to the eleven apostles, but “he was seen of above five hundred\nbrethren at once.”[628] By the mission of the Holy Spirit he gave an\nundeniable proof, not only of his life, but also of his sovereign\ndominion; according to his prediction, “It is expedient for you that I\ngo away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but\nif I depart, I will send him unto you.”[629] Paul, in his way to\nDamascus, was not prostrated to the ground by the influence of a dead\nman, but felt that the person whom he was opposing was armed with\nsupreme power. He appeared to Stephen for another reason—to overcome the\nfear of death by an assurance of life.[630] To refuse credit to\ntestimonies so numerous and authentic, is not diffidence, but perverse\nand unreasonable obstinacy.\nIV. The remark we have made, that in proving the resurrection, our minds\nshould be directed to the infinite power of God, is briefly suggested in\nthese words of Paul: “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be\nfashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby\nhe is able even to subdue all things unto himself.”[631] It would\ntherefore be extremely unreasonable here, to consider what could\npossibly happen in the ordinary course of nature, when the object\nproposed to us is an inestimable miracle, the magnitude of which absorbs\nall our faculties. Yet Paul adduces an example from nature to reprove\nthe folly of those who deny the resurrection. “Thou fool,” says he,\n“that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.”[632] He tells\nus that seed sown displays an image of the resurrection, because the\ncorn is reproduced from putrefaction. Nor would it be a thing so\ndifficult to believe, if we paid proper attention to the miracles which\npresent themselves to our view in all parts of the world. But let us\nremember, that no man will be truly persuaded of the future\nresurrection, but he who is filled with admiration, and ascribes to the\npower of God the glory that is due to it. Transported with this\nconfidence, Isaiah exclaims, “Thy dead men shall live; together with my\ndead body shall they arise; awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.”[633]\nSurrounded by desperate circumstances, he has recourse to God, the\nAuthor of life, unto whom, as the Psalmist says, “belong the issues from\ndeath.”[634] Even reduced to a state resembling a dead carcass more than\na living man, yet relying on the power of God, just as if he were in\nperfect health, Job looks forward without any doubts to that day. “I\nknow,” says he, “that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the\nlatter day upon the earth,” there to display his power; “and though\nafter my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God;\nwhom I shall see for myself, and not another.”[635] For though some\npersons employ great subtilty to pervert these texts, as if they ought\nnot to be understood of the resurrection, they nevertheless confirm what\nthey wish to destroy; since holy men, in the midst of calamities, seek\nconsolation from no other quarter than from the similitude of the\nresurrection; which more fully appears from a passage in Ezekiel.[636]\nFor when the Jews rejected the promise of their restoration, and\nobjected, that there was no more probability of a way being opened for\ntheir return, than of the dead coming forth from their sepulchres, a\nvision is presented to the prophet, of a field full of dry bones, and\nGod commands them to receive flesh and nerves. Though this figure is\nintended to inspire the people with a hope of restoration, he borrows\nthe argument for it from the resurrection; as it is to us also the\nprincipal model of all the deliverances which believers experience in\nthis world. So Christ, after having declared that the voice of the\ngospel communicates life, in consequence of its rejection by the Jews,\nimmediately adds, “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the\nwhich all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come\nforth.”[637] After the example of Paul, therefore, let us even now\ntriumphantly exult in the midst of our conflicts, that he who has\npromised us a life to come “is able to keep that which we have committed\nto him;” and thus let us glory that “there is laid up for us a crown of\nrighteousness, which the righteous Judge shall give us.”[638] The\nconsequence of this will be, that all the troubles we suffer will point\nus to the life to come, “seeing it is a righteous thing with God,” and\nagreeable to his nature, “to recompense tribulation to them that trouble\nus, and to us who are” unjustly “troubled, rest, when the Lord Jesus\nshall be revealed, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire.”[639] But we\nmust remember what immediately follows, that “he shall come to be\nglorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe,”\nbecause they believe the gospel.\nV. Now, though the minds of men ought to be continually occupied with\nthe study of this subject, yet as if they expressly intended to abolish\nall remembrance of the resurrection, they have called death the end of\nall things, and the destruction of man. For Solomon certainly speaks\naccording to a common and received opinion, when he says, “A living dog\nis better than a dead lion.”[640] And again: “Who knows whether the\nspirit of man goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast goeth\ndownward?”[641] This brutish stupidity has infected all ages of the\nworld, and even forced its way into the Church; for the Sadducees had\nthe audacity publicly to profess, that there is no resurrection, and\nthat souls are mortal. But that none might be excused by this gross\nignorance, the very instinct of nature has always set before the eyes of\nunbelievers an image of the resurrection. For what is the sacred and\ninviolable custom of interring the dead, but a pledge of another life?\nNor can it be objected that this originated in error; for the rites of\nsepulture were always observed among the holy fathers; and it pleased\nGod that the same custom should be retained among the Gentiles, that\ntheir torpor might be roused by the image of the resurrection thereby\nset before them. Though this ceremony produced no good effects upon\nthem, yet it will be useful to us, if we wisely consider its tendency;\nfor it is no slight refutation of unbelief, that all united in\nprofessing a thing that none of them believed. But Satan has not only\nstupefied men’s minds, to make them bury the memory of the resurrection\ntogether with the bodies of the dead, but has endeavoured to corrupt\nthis point of doctrine by various fictions, with an ultimate view to its\ntotal subversion. Not to mention that he began to oppose it in the days\nof Paul, not long after arose the Millenarians, who limited the reign of\nChrist to a thousand years. Their fiction is too puerile to require or\ndeserve refutation. Nor does the Revelation, which they quote in favour\nof their error, afford them any support; for the term of a thousand\nyears, there mentioned,[642] refers not to the eternal blessedness of\nthe Church, but to the various agitations which awaited the Church in\nits militant state upon earth. But the whole Scripture proclaims that\nthere will be no end of the happiness of the elect, or the punishment of\nthe reprobate. Now, all those things which are invisible to our eyes, or\nfar above the comprehension of our minds, must either be believed on the\nauthority of the oracles of God, or entirely rejected. Those who assign\nthe children of God a thousand years to enjoy the inheritance of the\nfuture life, little think what dishonour they cast on Christ and his\nkingdom. For if they are not invested with immortality, neither is\nChrist himself, into the likeness of whose glory they will be\ntransformed, received up into immortal glory. If their happiness will\nhave any end, it follows that the kingdom of Christ, on the stability of\nwhich it rests, is temporary. Lastly, either these persons are extremely\nignorant of all Divine things, or they are striving, with malignant\nperverseness, to overturn all the grace of God and power of Christ; and\nthese can never be perfectly fulfilled till sin is abolished, and death\nswallowed up, and eternal life completely established. But the folly of\nbeing afraid that too much cruelty is attributed to God, if the\nreprobate are doomed to eternal punishment, is even evident to the\nblind. Will the Lord do any injury by refusing the enjoyment of his\nkingdom to persons whose ingratitude shall have rendered them unworthy\nof it? But their sins are temporary. This I grant; but the majesty of\nGod, as well as his justice, which their sins have violated, is eternal.\nTheir iniquity, therefore, is justly remembered. Then the punishment is\nalleged to be excessive, being disproportioned to the crime. But this is\nintolerable blasphemy, when the majesty of God is so little valued, when\nthe contempt of it is considered of no more consequence than the\ndestruction of one soul. But let us pass by these triflers; lest,\ncontrary to what we have before said, we should appear to consider their\nreveries as worthy of refutation.\nVI. Beside these wild notions, the perverse curiosity of man has\nintroduced two others. Some have supposed that the whole man dies, and\nthat souls are raised again together with bodies; others, admitting the\nimmortality of souls, suppose they will be clothed with new bodies, and\nthereby deny the resurrection of the flesh. As I have touched on the\nformer of these notions in the creation of man, it will be sufficient\nagain to apprize my readers, that it is a brutish error, to represent\nthe spirit, formed after the image of God, as a fleeting breath which\nanimates the body only during this perishable life, and to annihilate\nthe temple of the Holy Spirit; in short, to despoil that part of us in\nwhich Divinity is eminently displayed, and the characters of immortality\nare conspicuous, of this property; so that the condition of the body\nmust be better and more excellent than that of the soul. Very different\nis the doctrine of Scripture, which compares the body to a habitation,\nfrom which we depart at death; because it estimates us by that part of\nour nature which constitutes the distinction between us and the brutes.\nThus Peter, when near his death, says, “Shortly I must put off this my\ntabernacle.”[643] And Paul, speaking of believers, having said that “if\nour earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building\nin the heavens,” adds that “whilst we are at home in the body, we are\nabsent from the Lord, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and\nto be present with the Lord.”[644] Unless our souls survive our bodies,\nwhat is it that is present with God when separated from the body? But\nthe apostle removes all doubt when he says that we are “come to the\nspirits of just men made perfect.”[645] By which expression he means,\nthat we are associated with the holy fathers, who, though dead, still\nmaintain the same piety with us, so that we cannot be members of Christ\nwithout being united with them. If souls separated from bodies did not\nretain their existence so as to be capable of glory and felicity, Christ\nwould not have said to the thief, “To-day shalt thou be with me in\nparadise.”[646] Supported by such undeniable testimonies, let us not\nhesitate, after the example of Christ, when we die, to commend our\nspirits to God; or, like Stephen, to resign them to the care of Christ,\nwho is justly called the faithful “Shepherd and Bishop of souls.”\nOver-curious inquiry respecting their intermediate state is neither\nlawful nor useful. Many persons exceedingly perplex themselves by\ndiscussing what place they occupy, and whether they already enjoy the\nglory of heaven, or not. But it is folly and presumption to push our\ninquiries on unknown things beyond what God permits us to know. The\nScripture declares that Christ is present with them, and receives them\ninto paradise, where they enjoy consolation, and that the souls of the\nreprobate endure the torments which they have deserved; but it proceeds\nno further. Now, what teacher or doctor shall discover to us that which\nGod has concealed? The question respecting place is equally senseless\nand futile; because we know that the soul has no dimensions like the\nbody. The blessed assemblage of holy spirits being called the bosom of\nAbraham, teaches us that it is enough for us, at the close of this\npilgrimage, to be received by the common Father of believers, and to\nparticipate with him in the fruit of his faith. In the mean while, as\nthe Scripture uniformly commands us to look forward with eager\nexpectation to the coming of Christ, and defers the crown of glory which\nawaits us till that period, let us be content within these limits which\nGod prescribes to us—that the souls of pious men, after finishing their\nlaborious warfare, depart into a state of blessed rest, where they wait\nwith joy and pleasure for the fruition of the promised glory; and so,\nthat all things remain in suspense till Christ appears as the Redeemer.\nAnd there is no doubt that the condition of the reprobate is the same as\nJude assigns to the devils, who are confined and bound in chains till\nthey are brought forth to the punishment to which they are doomed.\nVII. Equally monstrous is the error of those who imagine that souls will\nnot resume the bodies which at present belong to them, but will be\nfurnished with others altogether different. It was the very futile\nreasoning of the Manichæans, that it is absurd to expect that the flesh\nwhich is so impure will ever rise again. As if there were no impurity\nattached to the souls, which they nevertheless encouraged to entertain\nhopes of a heavenly life. It was therefore just as if they had\nmaintained, that any thing infected with the contagion of sin is\nincapable of being purified by the power of God; for that reverie, that\nthe flesh was created by the devil, and therefore naturally impure, I at\npresent forbear to notice; and only observe, that whatever we have in us\nnow unworthy of heaven, will not hinder the resurrection. In the first\nplace, when Paul exhorts believers to “cleanse” themselves “from all\nfilthiness of the flesh and spirit,”[647] thence follows the judgment he\nelsewhere denounces, “that every one” shall “receive the things done in\nhis body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or\nbad;”[648] with which agrees another passage, “that the life also of\nJesus might be made manifest in our body.”[649] Wherefore in another\nplace, he prays to God that the whole person may “be preserved blameless\nunto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,” even the “body,” as well as\nthe “soul and spirit.”[650] And no wonder; for that those bodies which\nGod has dedicated as temples for himself, should sink into corruption,\nwithout any hope of resurrection, would be absurd in the extreme. What\nis to be concluded from their being members of Christ?[651] from God’s\nenjoining every part of them to be sanctified to himself, requiring\ntheir tongues to celebrate his name, their hands to be lifted up with\npurity to him,[652] and their bodies altogether to be presented to him\nas “living sacrifices?”[653] This part of our nature therefore being\ndignified with such illustrious honour by the heavenly Judge, what\nmadness is betrayed by a mortal man, in asserting it to be reduced to\nashes without any hope of restoration! And Paul, when he gives us this\nexhortation, “Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are\nGod’s,”[654] certainly does not countenance consigning to eternal\ncorruption that which he asserts to be consecrated to God. Nor is there\nany point more clearly established in Scripture, than the resurrection\nof our present bodies. “This corruptible,” says Paul, “must put on\nincorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”[655] If new\nbodies were to be formed by God, what would become of this change of\nquality? If it had been said, that we must be renewed, the ambiguity of\nthe expression might have given occasion for cavil: now, when he\nparticularly designates the bodies that surround us, and promises that\nthey shall be “raised in incorruption,” it is a sufficient denial of the\nformation of new ones. “He could not indeed,” says Tertullian, “have\nspoken more expressly, unless he had held his own skin in his hand.” Nor\nwill any cavil evade the declaration of Isaiah, cited by the apostle,\nrespecting Christ as the future Judge of the world: “As I live, saith\nthe Lord, every knee shall bow to me;”[656] for he plainly declares to\nthe persons addressed by him, that they shall be obliged to give an\naccount of their lives; which would not be reasonable, if new bodies\nwere to be placed at the tribunal. There is no obscurity in the language\nof Daniel: “Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall\nawake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting\ncontempt.”[657] For God does not collect fresh materials from the four\nelements for the fabrication of men, but calls the dead out of their\nsepulchres. And this the plainest reason dictates. For if death, which\noriginated in the fall of man, be adventitious, and not necessary to our\nnature, the restoration effected by Christ belongs to the same body\nwhich was thus rendered mortal. From the ridicule of the Athenians, when\nPaul asserted the resurrection, it is easy to infer the nature of his\ndoctrine; and that ridicule is of no small weight for the confirmation\nof our faith. The injunction of Christ also is worthy of attention:\n“Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul;\nbut rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in\nhell.”[658] For there would be no reason for this fear, if the body\nwhich we now carry about were not liable to punishment. Another of\nChrist’s declarations is equally plain: “The hour is coming, in the\nwhich all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come\nforth, they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and they\nthat have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.”[659] Shall we\nsay that souls rest in graves, and will there hear the voice of Christ,\nand not rather that bodies at his command will return to the vigour they\nhad lost? Besides, if we are to receive new bodies, where will be the\nconformity between the Head and members? Christ rose; was it by making\nhimself a new body? No, but according to his prediction, “Destroy this\ntemple, and in three days I will raise it up.”[660] The mortal body\nwhich he before possessed, he again assumed. For it would have conduced\nbut little to our benefit, if there had been a substitution of a new\nbody, and an annihilation of that which had been offered as an atoning\nsacrifice. We must, therefore, maintain the connection stated by the\napostle—that we shall rise, because Christ has risen;[661] for nothing\nis more improbable, than that our body, in which “we bear about the\ndying of the Lord Jesus,”[662] should be deprived of a resurrection\nsimilar to his. There was an illustrious example of this immediately on\nChrist’s resurrection, when “the graves were opened, and many bodies of\nthe saints which slept arose.”[663] For it cannot be denied, that this\nwas a prelude, or rather an earnest, of the final resurrection, which we\nexpect; such as was exhibited before in Enoch and Elias, whom Tertullian\nspeaks of as “the candidates of the resurrection,” because they were\ntaken into the immediate care of God, with an entire exemption from\ncorruption in body and soul.\nVIII. I am ashamed of consuming so many words on so clear a subject; but\nmy readers will cheerfully unite with me in submitting to this trouble,\nthat no room may be left for men of perverse and presumptuous minds to\ndeceive the unwary. The unsteady spirits I am now opposing, bring\nforward a figment of their own brains, that at the resurrection there\nwill be a creation of new bodies. What reason can induce them to adopt\nthis sentiment, but a seeming incredibility, in their apprehension, that\na body long consumed by corruption can ever return to its pristine\nstate? Unbelief, therefore, is the only source of this opinion. In the\nScripture, on the contrary, we are uniformly exhorted by the Spirit of\nGod to hope for the resurrection of our body. For this reason, baptism\nis spoken of by Paul as a seal of our future resurrection;[664] and we\nare as clearly invited to this confidence by the sacred Supper, when we\nreceive into our mouths the symbols of spiritual grace. And certainly\nthe exhortation of Paul, to “yield our members as instruments of\nrighteousness unto God,”[665] would lose all its force, if unaccompanied\nby what he afterwards subjoins: “He that raised up Christ from the dead,\nshall also quicken your mortal bodies.”[666] For what would it avail to\ndevote our feet, hands, eyes, and tongues to the service of God, if they\nwere not to participate the benefit and reward? This is clearly\nconfirmed by the following passage of Paul: “The body is not for\nfornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. And God hath\nboth raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own\npower.”[667] The following passages are still plainer—that our bodies\nare the “temples of the Holy Ghost,” and “members of Christ.”[668] In\nthe mean time, we see how he connects the resurrection with chastity and\nholiness; and so he just after extends the price of redemption to our\nbodies. Now, it would be extremely unreasonable that the body of Paul,\nin which he “bore the marks of the Lord Jesus,”[669] and in which he\neminently glorified Christ, should be deprived of the reward of the\ncrown. Hence also that exultation: “We look for the Saviour from heaven,\nwho shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his\nglorious body.”[670] And if it be true, “that we must through much\ntribulation enter into the kingdom of God,”[671] there can be no reason\nfor prohibiting this entrance to the bodies, which God trains under the\nbanner of the cross, and honours with the glory of victory. Therefore no\ndoubt has ever been entertained by the saints, whether they should hope\nto be companions of Christ hereafter; who transfers to his own person\nall the afflictions with which we are tried, to teach us that they are\nconducting us to life. And God also established the holy fathers under\nthe law in this faith by an external ceremony. For to what purpose was\nthe rite of sepulture, as we have already seen, but to instruct them\nthat another life was prepared for the interred bodies? The same was\nsuggested by the spices and other symbols of immortality, which, like\nthe sacrifices under the law, assisted the obscurity of direct\ninstruction. Nor did this custom arise from superstition; for we find\nthe Holy Spirit as diligent in mentioning the sepultures, as in\ninsisting on the principal mysteries of faith. And Christ commends this\nas no mean office;[672] certainly for no other reason, but because it\nraises our eyes from the view of the grave, which corrupts and dissolves\nall things, to the spectacle of future renovation. Besides the very\ncareful observance of this ceremony, which is commended in the fathers,\nsufficiently proves it to have been an excellent and valuable assistance\nto faith. Nor would Abraham have discovered such solicitous concern\nabout the sepulchre of his wife, if he had not been actuated by motives\nof religion, and the prospect of more than worldly advantage; that by\nadorning her dead body with the emblems of the resurrection, he might\nconfirm his own faith, and that of his family.[673] There is yet a\nclearer proof of this in the example of Jacob; who, to testify to his\nposterity that the hope of the promised land did not forsake his heart\neven in death, commands his bones to be reconveyed thither.[674] If he\nwas to be furnished with a new body, would not this have been a\nridiculous command concerning dust that was soon to be annihilated?\nWherefore, if the authority of the Scripture has any weight with us, no\nclearer or stronger proof of any doctrine can possibly be desired. Even\nchildren understand this to be the meaning of the term “resurrection;”\nfor we never apply this term to any instance of original creation; nor\nwould it be consistent with that declaration of Christ, “Of all which\nthe Father hath given me, I shall lose nothing, but will raise it up\nagain at the last day.”[675] The same is implied in the word “sleeping,”\nwhich is only applicable to the body. Hence the appellation of\n_cemetery_, or _sleeping-place_, given to places of burial. It remains\nfor me to touch a little on the manner of the resurrection. And I shall\nbut just hint at it; because Paul, by calling it a mystery, exhorts us\nto sobriety, and forbids all licentiousness of subtle and extravagant\nspeculation. In the first place, let it be remembered, as we have\nobserved, that we shall rise again with the same bodies we have now, as\nto the substance, but that the quality will be different; just as the\nvery body of Christ which had been offered as a sacrifice was raised\nagain, but with such new and superior qualities, as though it had been\naltogether different. Paul represents this by some familiar examples.\nFor as the flesh of man and of brutes is the same in substance, but not\nin quality; as the matter of all the stars is the same, but they differ\nin glory; so, though we shall retain the substance of our body, he tells\nus there will be a change, which will render its condition far more\nexcellent.[676] The “corruptible” body, therefore, will neither perish\nnor vanish, in order to our resurrection; but having laid aside\ncorruption, will “put on incorruption.”[677] God, having all the\nelements subject to his control, will find no difficulty in commanding\nthe earth, the water, and the fire, to restore whatever they appear to\nhave consumed. This is declared in figurative language by Isaiah:\n“Behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of\nthe earth for their iniquity; the earth also shall disclose her blood,\nand shall no more cover her slain.”[678] But we must remark the\ndifference between those who shall have been already dead, and those\nwhom that day shall find alive. “We shall not all sleep,” says Paul,\n“but we shall all be changed;”[679] that is, there will be no necessity\nfor any distance of time to intervene between death and the commencement\nof the next life; for “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the\ntrumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,” and\nthe living transformed by a sudden change into the same glory. So in\nanother Epistle he comforts believers who were to die, that those “which\nare alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them\nwhich are asleep,” but that “the dead in Christ shall rise first.”[680]\nIf it be objected that the apostle says, “It is appointed unto men once\nto die,”[681] the answer is easy,—that where the state of the nature is\nchanged, it is a species of death, and may without impropriety be so\ncalled; and therefore there is a perfect consistence between these\nthings, that all will be removed by death when they put off the mortal\nbody, but that a separation of the body and soul will not be necessary,\nwhere there will be an instantaneous change.\nIX. But here arises a question of greater difficulty. How can the\nresurrection, which is a peculiar benefit of Christ, be common to the\nimpious and the subjects of the Divine curse? We know that in Adam all\nwere sentenced to death;[682] Christ comes as “the resurrection and the\nlife;”[683] but was it to bestow life promiscuously on all mankind? But\nwhat would be more improbable, than that they should attain, in their\nobstinate blindness, what the pious worshippers of God recover by faith\nalone? Yet it remains certain, that one will be a resurrection to\njudgment, the other to life; and that Christ will come to “separate the\nsheep from the goats.”[684] I reply, we ought not to think that so very\nstrange, which we see exemplified in our daily experience. We know that\nin Adam we lost the inheritance of the whole world, and have no more\nright to the enjoyment of common aliments, than to the fruit of the tree\nof life. How is it, then, that God not only “maketh his sun to rise on\nthe evil and on the good,”[685] but that, for the accommodations of the\npresent life, his inestimable liberality is diffused in the most copious\nabundance? Hence we see, that things which properly belong to Christ and\nhis members, are also extended to the impious; not to become their\nlegitimate possession, but to render them more inexcusable. Thus impious\nmen frequently experience God’s beneficence in remarkable instances,\nwhich sometimes exceed all the blessings of the pious, but which,\nnevertheless, are the means of aggravating their condemnation. If it be\nobjected, that the resurrection is improperly compared with fleeting and\nterrestrial advantages, I reply again, that when men were first\nalienated from God, the Fountain of life, they deserved the ruin of the\ndevil, to be altogether destroyed; yet the wonderful counsel of God\ndevised a middle state, that without life they might live in death. It\nought not to be thought more unreasonable, if the impious are raised\nfrom the dead, in order to be dragged to the tribunal of Christ, whom\nthey now refuse to hear as their Master and Teacher. For it would be a\nslight punishment to be destroyed by death, if they were not to be\nbrought before the Judge whose infinite and endless vengeance they have\nincurred, to receive the punishments due to their rebellion. But though\nwe must maintain what we have asserted, and what is asserted by Paul in\nhis celebrated confession before Felix, “that there shall be a\nresurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust,”[686] yet the\nScripture more commonly exhibits the resurrection to the children of God\nalone, in connection with the glory of heaven; because, strictly\nspeaking, Christ will come, not for the destruction of the world, but\nfor purposes of salvation. This is the reason that the Creed mentions\nonly the life of blessedness.\nX. But, as the prophecy of “death being swallowed up in victory,” shall\nthen, and not till then, be fully accomplished,—let us always reflect on\neternal felicity as the end of the resurrection; of the excellence of\nwhich, if every thing were said that could be expressed by all the\ntongues of men, yet the smallest part of it would scarcely be mentioned.\nFor though we are plainly informed, that the kingdom of God is full of\nlight, joy, felicity, and glory, yet all that is mentioned remains far\nabove our comprehension, and enveloped, as it were, in enigmatical\nobscurity, till the arrival of that day, when he shall exhibit his glory\nto us face to face. “Now are we the sons of God, (says John,) and it\ndoth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know, that when he shall\nappear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.”[687]\nWherefore the prophets, because they could not describe that spiritual\nblessedness by any terms expressive of its sublime nature, generally\nrepresented it under corporeal images. Yet, as any intimation of that\nhappiness must kindle in us a fervour of desire, let us chiefly dwell on\nthis reflection—If God, as an inexhaustible fountain, contains within\nhimself a plenitude of all blessings, nothing beyond him can ever be\ndesired by those who aspire to the supreme good, and a perfection of\nhappiness. This we are taught in various passages of Scripture.\n“Abraham,” says God, “I am thy exceeding great reward.”[688] With this\nDavid agrees: “The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance; the lines\nare fallen unto me in pleasant places.”[689] Again: “I will behold thy\nface; I shall be satisfied.”[690] Peter declares, that believers are\ncalled, “that they might be partakers of the Divine nature.”[691] How\nwill this be? Because “he shall be glorified in his saints, and admired\nin all them that believe.”[692] If the Lord will make the elect\npartakers of his glory, strength, and righteousness, and will even\nbestow himself upon them to be enjoyed, and, what is better than this,\nto be in some sense united to them,—let us remember, that in this favour\nevery kind of felicity is comprised. And after we have made considerable\nprogress in this meditation, we may still acknowledge the conceptions of\nour minds to be extremely low, in comparison with the sublimity of this\nmystery. Sobriety, therefore, is the more necessary for us on this\nsubject, lest, forgetful of our slender capacity, we presumptuously soar\nto too high an elevation, and are overwhelmed with the blaze of\ncelestial glory. We perceive, likewise, how we are actuated by an\ninordinate desire of knowing more than is right; which gives rise to a\nvariety of questions, both frivolous and pernicious. I call those\nfrivolous, from which no advantage can possibly be derived. But those of\nthe second class are worse, involving persons, who indulge them, in\ninjurious speculations, and therefore I call them pernicious. What is\ntaught in the Scriptures, we ought to receive without any controversy;\nthat as God, in the various distribution of his gifts to the saints in\nthis world, does not equally enlighten them all, so in heaven, where God\nwill crown those gifts, there will be an inequality in the degrees of\ntheir glory. The language of Paul is not indiscriminately applicable to\nall—“Ye are our glory and joy at our Lord’s coming;”[693] nor Christ’s\naddress to his apostles—“Ye shall sit judging the twelve tribes of\nIsrael.”[694] But Paul, who knew that according as God enriches the\nsaints with spiritual gifts on earth, so he adorns them with glory in\nheaven, doubts not that there is in reserve for him a peculiar crown in\nproportion to his labours. And Christ commends to his apostles the\ndignity of the office with which they were invested, by assuring them\nthat the reward of it was laid up in heaven.[695] Thus also Daniel:\n“They that be wise, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and\nthey that turn many to righteousness, as the stars, for ever and\never.”[696] And an attentive consideration of the Scriptures will\nconvince us, that they not only promise eternal life generally to\nbelievers, but also a special reward to each individual. Whence that\nexpression of Paul—“The Lord reward him according to his works.”[697] It\nis also confirmed by the promise of Christ that his disciples should\nreceive a hundred-fold more in eternal life.[698] In a word, as Christ\nbegins the glory of his body by a manifold variety of gifts in this\nworld, and enlarges it by degrees, in the same manner he will also\nperfect it in heaven.\nXI. As all the pious will receive this with one consent, because it is\nsufficiently attested in the word of God, so, on the other hand,\ndismissing abstruse questions, which they know to be obstructions to\nthem, they will not transgress the limits prescribed to them. For\nmyself, I not only refrain as an individual from the unnecessary\ninvestigation of useless questions, but think it my duty to be cautious,\nlest I encourage the vanity of others by answering them. Men, thirsting\nafter useless knowledge, inquire what will be the distance between the\nprophets and apostles, and between the apostles and martyrs; and how\nmany degrees of difference there will be between those who have married\nand those who have lived and died in celibacy; in short, they leave not\na corner of heaven unexplored. The next object of their inquiry is, what\nend will be answered by the restoration of the world; since the children\nof God will want nothing of all its vast and incomparable abundance, but\nwill be like the angels of God, whose freedom from all animal\nnecessities is the symbol of eternal blessedness. I reply, there will be\nsuch great pleasantness in the very prospect, and such exquisite\nsweetness in the mere knowledge, without any use of it, that this\nfelicity will far exceed all the accommodations afforded us in the\npresent state. Let us suppose ourselves placed in some region the most\nopulent in the world, and furnished with every pleasure; who would not\nsometimes be prevented by disease from making use of the bounties of\nGod? who would not often have his enjoyment of them interrupted by the\nconsequences of intemperance? Hence it follows, that calm and serene\nenjoyment, pure from every vice and free from all defect, although there\nshould be no use of a corruptible life, is the perfection of happiness.\nOthers go further, and inquire, whether dross and all impurities in\nmetals are not removed from that restoration, and incompatible with such\na state. Though I in some measure grant this, I expect, with Paul, a\nreparation of all the evils caused by sin, for which he represents the\ncreatures as groaning and travailing. They proceed further still, and\ninquire, what better state awaits the human race, when the blessing of\nposterity shall no longer be enjoyed. The solution of this question also\nis easy. The splendid commendations of it in the Scriptures relate to\nthat progressive increase, by which God is continually carrying forward\nthe system of nature to its consummation. But as the unwary are easily\ncaught by such temptations, and are afterwards drawn further into the\nlabyrinth, till, at length, every one being pleased with his own\nopinion, there is no end to disputes,—the best and shortest rule for our\nconduct, is to content ourselves with “seeing through a glass darkly,”\ntill we shall “see face to face.”[699] For very few persons are\nconcerned about the way that leads to heaven, but all are anxious to\nknow, before the time, what passes there. Men in general are slow, and\nreluctant to engage in the conflict, and yet portray to themselves\nimaginary triumphs.\nXII. Now, as no description can equal the severity of the Divine\nvengeance on the reprobate, their anguish and torment are figuratively\nrepresented to us under corporeal images; as, darkness, weeping, and\ngnashing of teeth, unextinguishable fire, a worm incessantly gnawing the\nheart.[700] For there can be no doubt but that, by such modes of\nexpression, the Holy Spirit intended to confound all our faculties with\nhorror; as when it is said, that “Tophet is ordained of old; the pile\nthereof is fire and much wood: the breath of the Lord, like a stream of\nbrimstone, doth kindle it.”[701] As these representations should assist\nus in forming some conception of the wretched condition of the wicked,\nso they ought principally to fix our attention on the calamity of being\nalienated from the presence of God; and in addition to this,\nexperiencing such hostility from the Divine majesty as to be unable to\nescape from its continual pursuit. For, in the first place, his\nindignation is like a most violent flame, which devours and consumes all\nthat it touches. In the next place, all the creatures so subserve the\nexecution of his judgment, that those to whom the Lord will thus\nmanifest his wrath, will find the heaven, the earth, and the sea, the\nanimals, and all that exists, inflamed, as it were, with dire\nindignation against them, and all armed for their destruction. It is no\ntrivial threatening, therefore, denounced by the apostle, that\nunbelievers “shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the\npresence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.”[702] And when\nthe prophets excite terror by corporeal figures, though they advance\nnothing hyperbolical for our dull understandings, yet they mingle\npreludes of the future judgment with the sun, the moon, and the whole\nfabric of the world. Wherefore miserable consciences find no repose, but\nare harassed and agitated with a dreadful tempest, feel themselves torn\nasunder by an angry God, and, transfixed and penetrated by mortal\nstings, are terrified at the thunderbolts of God, and broken by the\nweight of his hand; so that to sink into any gulfs and abysses would be\nmore tolerable than to stand for a moment in these terrors. How great\nand severe, then, is the punishment, to endure the never ceasing effects\nof his wrath! On which subject there is a memorable passage in the\nninetieth psalm; that though by his countenance he scatters all mortals,\nand turns them to destruction, yet he encourages his servants in\nproportion to their timidity in this world, to excite them, though under\nthe burden of the cross, to press forward, till he shall be all in all.\nFootnote 600:\n2 Tim. i. 10.\nFootnote 601:\nJohn v. 24.\nFootnote 602:\nEphes. ii. 19.\nFootnote 603:\nEphes. ii. 6.\nFootnote 604:\nRom. viii. 24.\nFootnote 605:\nHeb. xi. 1.\nFootnote 606:\n2 Cor. v. 6.\nFootnote 607:\nCol. iii. 3, 4.\nFootnote 608:\nTitus ii. 12, 13.\nFootnote 609:\n1 Peter i. 8, 9.\nFootnote 610:\nCol. i. 5.\nFootnote 611:\nMatt. vi. 21.\nFootnote 612:\nPhil. iii. 14.\nFootnote 613:\nPhil. iii. 8-11.\nFootnote 614:\nPhil. iii. 20.\nFootnote 615:\nRom. viii. 19-23.\nFootnote 616:\nHeb. ix. 28.\nFootnote 617:\n1 Cor. xv. 13, &c.\nFootnote 618:\n2 Cor. iv. 10.\nFootnote 619:\n1 Cor. xv. 13.\nFootnote 620:\nPsalm xvi. 10.\nFootnote 621:\nPhil. iii. 21.\nFootnote 622:\nCol. iii. 4.

          "content": "THE TRUE CHURCH, AND THE NECESSITY OF OUR UNION WITH HER, BEING THE\nMOTHER OF ALL THE PIOUS.\nThat by the faith of the gospel Christ becomes ours, and we become\npartakers of the salvation procured by him, and of eternal happiness,\nhas been explained in the preceding Book. But as our ignorance and\nslothfulness, and, I may add, the vanity of our minds, require external\naids, in order to the production of faith in our hearts, and its\nincrease and progressive advance even to its completion, God has\nprovided such aids in compassion to our infirmity; and that the\npreaching of the gospel might be maintained, he has deposited this\ntreasure with the Church. He has appointed pastors and teachers, that\nhis people might be taught by their lips; he has invested them with\nauthority; in short, he has omitted nothing that could contribute to a\nholy unity of faith, and to the establishment of good order.[703] First\nof all, he has instituted Sacraments, which we know by experience to be\nmeans of the greatest utility for the nourishment and support of our\nfaith. For as, during our confinement in the prison of our flesh, we\nhave not yet attained to the state of angels, God has, in his wonderful\nprovidence, accommodated himself to our capacity, by prescribing a way\nin which we might approach him, notwithstanding our immense distance\nfrom him. Wherefore the order of instruction requires us now to treat of\nthe Church and its government, orders, and power; secondly, of the\nSacraments; and lastly, of Civil Government; and at the same time to\ncall off the pious readers from the abuses of the Papacy, by which Satan\nhas corrupted every thing that God had appointed to be instrumental to\nour salvation. I shall begin with the Church, in whose bosom it is God’s\nwill that all his children should be collected, not only to be nourished\nby her assistance and ministry during their infancy and childhood, but\nalso to be governed by her maternal care, till they attain a mature age,\nand at length reach the end of their faith. For it is not lawful to “put\nasunder” those things “which God hath joined together;”[704] that the\nChurch is the mother of all those who have him for their Father; and\nthat not only under the law, but since the coming of Christ also,\naccording to the testimony of the apostle, who declares the new and\nheavenly Jerusalem to be “the mother of us all.”[705]\nII. That article of the Creed, in which we profess to believe THE\nCHURCH, refers not only to the visible Church of which we are now\nspeaking, but likewise to all the elect of God, including the dead as\nwell as the living. The word BELIEVE is used, because it is often\nimpossible to discover any difference between the children of God and\nthe ungodly; between his peculiar flock and wild beasts. The particle\nIN, interpolated by many, is not supported by any probable reason. I\nconfess that it is generally adopted at present, and is not destitute of\nthe suffrage of antiquity, being found in the Nicene Creed, as it is\ntransmitted to us in ecclesiastical history. Yet it is evident from the\nwritings of the fathers, that it was anciently admitted without\ncontroversy to say, “I believe the Church,” not “_in_ the Church.” For\nnot only is this word not used by Augustine and the ancient writer of\nthe work “On the Exposition of the Creed,” which passes under the name\nof Cyprian, but they particularly remark that there would be an\nimpropriety in the expression, if this preposition were inserted; and\nthey confirm their opinion by no trivial reason. For we declare that we\nbelieve _in God_ because our mind depends upon him as true, and our\nconfidence rests in him. But this would not be applicable to the Church,\nany more than to “the remission of sins,” or the “resurrection of the\nbody.” Therefore, though I am averse to contentions about words, yet I\nwould rather adopt a proper phraseology adapted to express the subject\nthan affect forms of expression by which the subject would be\nunnecessarily involved in obscurity. The design of this clause is to\nteach us, that though the devil moves every engine to destroy the grace\nof Christ, and all the enemies of God exert the most furious violence in\nthe same attempt, yet his grace cannot possibly be extinguished, nor can\nhis blood be rendered barren, so as not to produce some fruit. Here we\nmust regard both the secret election of God, and his internal vocation;\nbecause he alone “knoweth them that are his;” and keeps them enclosed\nunder his “seal,” to use the expression of Paul;[706] except that they\nbear his impression, by which they may be distinguished from the\nreprobate. But because a small and contemptible number is concealed\namong a vast multitude, and a few grains of wheat are covered with a\nheap of chaff, we must leave to God alone the knowledge of his Church\nwhose foundation is his secret election. Nor is it sufficient to include\nin our thoughts and minds the whole multitude of the elect, unless we\nconceive of such a unity of the Church, into which we know ourselves to\nbe truly ingrafted. For unless we are united with all the other members\nunder Christ our Head, we can have no hope of the future inheritance.\nTherefore the Church is called CATHOLIC, or universal; because there\ncould not be two or three churches, without Christ being divided, which\nis impossible. But all the elect of God are so connected with each other\nin Christ, that as they depend upon one head, so they grow up together\nas into one body, compacted together like members of the same body;\nbeing made truly one, as living by one faith, hope, and charity, through\nthe same Divine Spirit, being called not only to the same inheritance of\neternal life, but also to a participation of one God and Christ.\nTherefore, though the melancholy desolation which surrounds us, seems to\nproclaim that there is nothing left of the Church, let us remember that\nthe death of Christ is fruitful, and that God wonderfully preserves his\nChurch as it were in hiding-places; according to what he said to Elijah:\n“I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the\nknee to Baal.”[707]\nIII. This article of the creed, however, relates in some measure to the\nexternal Church, that every one of us may maintain a brotherly agreement\nwith all the children of God, may pay due deference to the authority of\nthe Church, and, in a word, may conduct himself as one of the flock.\nTherefore we add THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS—a clause which, though\ngenerally omitted by the ancients, ought not to be neglected, because it\nexcellently expresses the character of the Church; as though it had been\nsaid that the saints are united in the fellowship of Christ on this\ncondition, that whatever benefits God confers upon them, they should\nmutually communicate to each other. This destroys not the diversity of\ngrace, for we know that the gifts of the Spirit are variously\ndistributed; nor does it disturb the order of civil polity, which\nsecures to every individual the exclusive enjoyment of his property, as\nit is necessary for the preservation of the peace of society that men\nshould have peculiar and distinct possessions. But the community\nasserted is such as Luke describes, that “the multitude of them that\nbelieved were of one heart and of one soul;”[708] and Paul, when he\nexhorts the Ephesians to be “one body, and one spirit, even as they were\ncalled in one hope.”[709] Nor is it possible, if they are truly\npersuaded that God is a common Father to them all, and Christ their\ncommon Head, but that, being united in brotherly affection, they should\nmutually communicate their advantages to each other. Now, it highly\nconcerns us to know what benefit we receive from this. For we believe\nthe Church, in order to have a certain assurance that we are members of\nit. For thus our salvation rests on firm and solid foundations, so that\nit cannot fall into ruin, though the whole fabric of the world should be\ndissolved. First, it is founded on the election of God, and can be\nliable to no variation or failure, but with the subversion of his\neternal providence. In the next place, it is united with the stability\nof Christ, who will no more suffer his faithful people to be severed\nfrom him, than his members to be torn in pieces. Besides, we are\ncertain, as long as we continue in the bosom of the Church, that we\nshall remain in possession of the truth. Lastly, we understand these\npromises to belong to us: “In mount Zion shall be deliverance.”[710] God\nis in the midst of her; she shall not be moved.“[711] Such is the effect\nof union with the Church, that it retains us in the fellowship of God.\nThe very word _communion_ likewise contains abundant consolation; for\nwhile it is certain that whatever the Lord confers upon his members and\nours belong to us, our hope is confirmed by all the benefits which they\nenjoy. But in order to embrace the unity of the Church in this manner,\nit is unnecessary, as we have observed, to see the Church with our eyes,\nor feel it with our hands; on the contrary, from its being an object of\nfaith, we are taught that it is no less to be considered as existing,\nwhen it escapes our observation, than if it were evident to our eyes.\nNor is our faith the worse, because it acknowledges the Church which we\ndo not fully comprehend; for we are not commanded here to distinguish\nthe reprobate from the elect, which is not our province, but that of God\nalone; we are only required to be assured in our minds, that all those\nwho, by the mercy of God the Father, through the efficacious influence\nof the Holy Spirit, have attained to the participation of Christ, are\nseparated as the peculiar possession and portion of God; and that being\nnumbered among them, we are partakers of such great grace.\nIV. But as our present design is to treat of the _visible_ Church, we\nmay learn even from the title of _mother_, how useful and even necessary\nit is for us to know her; since there is no other way of entrance into\nlife, unless we are conceived by her, born of her, nourished at her\nbreast, and continually preserved under her care and government till we\nare divested of this mortal flesh, and “become like the angels.”[712]\nFor our infirmity will not admit of our dismission from her school; we\nmust continue under her instruction and discipline to the end of our\nlives. It is also to be remarked, that out of her bosom there can be no\nhope of remission of sins, or any salvation, according to the testimony\nof Joel and Isaiah;[713] which is confirmed by Ezekiel,[714] when he\ndenounces that those whom God excludes from the heavenly life, shall not\nbe enrolled among his people. So, on the contrary, those who devote\nthemselves to the service of God, are said to inscribe their names among\nthe citizens of Jerusalem. For which reason the Psalmist says, “Remember\nme, O Lord, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit\nme with thy salvation; that I may see the good of thy chosen; that I may\nrejoice in the gladness of thy nation; that I may glory with thine\ninheritance.”[715] In these words the paternal favour of God, and the\npeculiar testimony of the spiritual life, are restricted to his flock,\nto teach us that it is always fatally dangerous to be separated from the\nChurch.\nV. But let us proceed to state what belongs to this subject. Paul\nwrites, that Christ, “that he might fill all things, gave some apostles,\nand some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers;\nfor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the\nedifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the\nfaith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto\nthe measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.”[716] We see that\nthough God could easily make his people perfect in a single moment, yet\nit was not his will that they should grow to mature age, but under the\neducation of the Church. We see the means expressed; the preaching of\nthe heavenly doctrine is assigned to the pastors. We see that all are\nplaced under the same regulation, in order that they may submit\nthemselves with gentleness and docility of mind to be governed by the\npastors who are appointed for this purpose. Isaiah had long before\ndescribed the kingdom of Christ by this character: “My Spirit that is\nupon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart\nout of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth\nof thy seed’s seed, from henceforth and for ever.”[717] Hence it\nfollows, that all who reject the spiritual food for their souls, which\nis extended to them by the hands of the Church, deserve to perish with\nhunger and want. It is God who inspires us with faith, but it is through\nthe instrumentality of the gospel, according to the declaration of Paul,\n“that faith cometh by hearing.”[718] So also the power to save resides\nin God, but, as the same apostle testifies in another place, he displays\nit in the preaching of the gospel. With this design, in former ages he\ncommanded solemn assemblies to be held in the sanctuary, that the\ndoctrine taught by the mouth of the priest might maintain the unity of\nthe faith; and the design of those magnificent titles, where the temple\nis called God’s “rest,” his “sanctuary,” and “dwelling-place,” where he\nis said to “dwell between the cherubim,”[719] was no other than to\npromote the esteem, love, reverence, and dignity of the heavenly\ndoctrine; which the view of a mortal and despised man would otherwise\ngreatly diminish. That we may know, therefore, that we have an\ninestimable treasure communicated to us from earthen vessels,[720] God\nhimself comes forward, and as he is the Author of this arrangement, so\nhe will be acknowledged as present in his institution. Therefore, after\nhaving forbidden his people to devote themselves to auguries,\ndivinations, magical arts, necromancy, and other superstitions, he adds,\nthat he will give them what ought to be sufficient for every purpose,\nnamely, that he will never leave them without prophets. Now, as he did\nnot refer his ancient people to angels, but raised up earthly teachers,\nwho truly discharged the office of angels, so, in the present day, he is\npleased to teach us by the instrumentality of men. And as formerly he\nwas not content with the written law, but appointed the priests as\ninterpreters, at whose lips the people might inquire its true meaning,\nso, in the present day, he not only requires us to be attentive to\nreading, but has appointed teachers for our assistance. This is attended\nwith a twofold advantage. For on the one hand, it is a good proof of our\nobedience when we listen to his ministers, just as if he were addressing\nus himself; and on the other, he has provided for our infirmity, by\nchoosing to address us through the medium of human interpreters, that he\nmay sweetly allure us to him, rather than to drive us away from him by\nhis thunders. And the propriety of this familiar manner of teaching, is\nevident to all the pious, from the terror with which the majesty of God\njustly alarms them. Those who consider the authority of the doctrine as\nweakened by the meanness of the men who are called to teach it, betray\ntheir ingratitude; because among so many excellent gifts with which God\nhas adorned mankind, it is a peculiar privilege, that he deigns to\nconsecrate men’s lips and tongues to his service, that his voice may be\nheard in them. Let us not therefore, on our parts, be reluctant to\nreceive and obey the doctrine of salvation proposed to us at his express\ncommand; for though the power of God is not confined to external means,\nyet he has confined us to the ordinary manner of teaching, the fanatical\nrejecters of which necessarily involve themselves in many fatal snares.\nMany are urged by pride, or disdain, or envy, to persuade themselves\nthat they can profit sufficiently by reading and meditating in private,\nand so to despise public assemblies, and consider preaching as\nunnecessary. But since they do all in their power to dissolve and break\nasunder the bond of unity, which ought to be preserved inviolable, not\none of them escapes the just punishment of this impious breach, but they\nall involve themselves in pestilent errors and pernicious reveries.\nWherefore, in order that the pure simplicity of faith may flourish among\nus, let us not be reluctant to use this exercise of piety, which the\nDivine institution has shown to be necessary, and which God so\nrepeatedly commends to us. There has never been found, among the most\nextravagant of mortals, one insolent enough to say that we ought to shut\nour ears against God; but the prophets and pious teachers, in all ages,\nhave had a difficult contest with the wicked, whose arrogance can never\nsubmit to be taught by the lips and ministry of men. Now, this is no\nother than effacing the image of God, which is discovered to us in the\ndoctrine. For the faithful under the former dispensation were directed\nto seek the face of God in the sanctuary;[721] and this is so frequently\nrepeated in the law, for no other reason, but because the doctrine of\nthe law and the exhortations of the prophets exhibited to them a lively\nimage of God; as Paul declares that his preaching displayed “the glory\nof God in the face of Jesus Christ.”[722] And in so much the greater\ndetestation ought we to hold those apostates, who make it their study to\ncause divisions in churches, as if they would drive away the sheep from\nthe fold, and throw them into the jaws of wolves. But let us remember\nwhat we have quoted from Paul—that the Church can only be edified by the\npreaching of this word, and that the saints have no common bond of union\nto hold them together, any longer than, while learning and profiting\nwith one accord, they observe the order which God has prescribed for the\nChurch. It was principally for this end, as I have already stated, that\nthe faithful under the law were commanded to resort to the sanctuary;\nbecause Moses not only celebrates it as the residence of God, but\nlikewise declares it to be the place where God has fixed the record of\nhis name;[723] which without the doctrine of piety, he plainly suggests,\nwould be of no use. And it is undoubtedly for the same reason that David\ncomplains, with great bitterness of soul, of being prevented from access\nto the tabernacle by the tyrannical cruelty of his enemies.[724] To many\npersons perhaps this appears to be a puerile lamentation, because it\ncould be but a very trivial loss, and not a privation of much\nsatisfaction to be absent from the court of the temple, provided he were\nin the possession of other pleasures. But by this one trouble, anxiety,\nand sorrow, he complains that he is grieved, tormented, and almost\nconsumed; because nothing is more valued by believers than this\nassistance, by which God gradually raises his people from one degree of\nelevation to another. For it is also to be remarked, that God always\nmanifested himself to the holy fathers, in the mirror of his doctrine,\nin such a manner that their knowledge of him was spiritual. Hence the\ntemple was not only called his _face_, but in order to guard against all\nsuperstition, was also designated as his _footstool_.[725] And this is\nthat happy conjunction in the unity of the faith spoken of by Paul, when\nall, from the highest to the lowest, are aspiring towards the head. All\nthe temples which the Gentiles erected to God with any other design,\nwere nothing but a profanation of his worship—a crime which, though not\nto an equal extent, was also frequently committed by the Jews. Stephen\nreproaches them for it in the language of Isaiah: “The Most High\ndwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is\nmy throne, and earth is my footstool,”[726] because God alone sanctifies\ntemples by his word, that they may be legitimately used for his worship.\nAnd if we presumptuously attempt any thing without his command, the evil\nbeginning is immediately succeeded by further inventions, which multiply\nthe mischief without end. Xerxes, however, acted with great\nindiscretion, when, at the advice of the magi, he burned or demolished\nall the temples of Greece, from an opinion of the absurdity that gods,\nto whom all space ought to be left perfectly free, should be enclosed\nwithin walls and roofs. As if it were not in the power of God to descend\nin any way to us, and yet at the same time not to make any change of\nplace, or to confine us to earthly means, but rather to use them as\nvehicles to elevate us towards his celestial glory, which fills all\nthings with its immensity, as well as transcends the heavens in its\nsublimity.\nVI. Now, as the present age has witnessed a violent dispute respecting\nthe efficacy of the ministry, some exaggerating its dignity beyond\nmeasure, and others contending that it is a criminal transfer to mortal\nman of what properly belongs to the Holy Spirit, to suppose that\nministers and teachers penetrate the mind and heart, so as to correct\nthe blindness of the one, and the hardness of the other,—we must proceed\nto a decision of this controversy. The arguments advanced on both sides\nmay be easily reconciled by a careful observation of the passages, in\nwhich God, the Author of preaching, connecting his Spirit with it,\npromises that it shall be followed with success; or those in which,\nseparating himself from all external aids, he attributes the\ncommencement of faith, as well as its subsequent progress, entirely and\nexclusively to himself. The office of the second Elias, according to\nMalachi, was to illuminate the minds and to “turn the hearts of the\nfathers to the children,” and the disobedient to the wisdom of the\njust.[727] Christ declares that he sent his disciples, that they “should\nbring forth fruit”[728] from their labours. What that fruit was, is\nbriefly defined by Peter, when he says that we are “born again, not of\ncorruptible seed, but of incorruptible.”[729] Therefore Paul glories\nthat he had “begotten” the Corinthians “through the gospel,” and that\nthey were “the seal of his apostleship;”[730] and even that he was “not\na minister of the letter,” merely striking the ear with a vocal sound,\nbut that the energy of the Spirit had been given to him to render his\ndoctrine efficacious.[731] In the same sense, he affirms, in another\nEpistle, that his “gospel came not in word only, but also in\npower.”[732] He declares also to the Galatians, that they “received the\nSpirit by the hearing of faith.”[733] In short, there are several\nplaces, in which he not only represents himself as a “labourer together\nwith God,”[734] but even attributes to himself the office of\ncommunicating salvation. He certainly never advanced all these things,\nin order to arrogate to himself the least praise independent of God, as\nhe briefly states in other passages: “Our entrance in unto you was not\nin vain.”[735] “I labour, striving according to his working, which\nworketh in me mightily.”[736] “He that wrought effectually in Peter to\nthe apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward\nthe Gentiles.”[737] Besides, it is evident, from other places, that he\nleaves ministers possessed of nothing, considered in themselves:\n“Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but\nGod that giveth the increase.”[738] Again: “I laboured more abundantly\nthan they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.”[739]\nAnd it is certainly necessary to bear in memory those passages, in which\nGod ascribes to himself the illumination of the mind and renovation of\nthe heart, and thereby declares it to be sacrilege for man to arrogate\nto himself any share in either. Yet every one who attends with docility\nof mind to the ministers whom God has appointed, will learn from the\nbeneficial effect, that this mode of teaching has not in vain been\npleasing to God, and that this yoke of modesty has not without reason\nbeen imposed upon believers.\nVII. From what has been said, I conceive it must now be evident what\njudgment we ought to form respecting the Church, which is visible to our\neyes, and falls under our knowledge. For we have remarked that the word\n_Church_ is used in the sacred Scriptures in two senses. Sometimes, when\nthey mention the Church, they intend that which is really such in the\nsight of God, into which none are received but those who by adoption and\ngrace are the children of God, and by the sanctification of the Spirit\nare the true members of Christ. And then it comprehends not only the\nsaints at any one time resident on earth, but all the elect who have\nlived from the beginning of the world. But the word _Church_ is\nfrequently used in the Scriptures to designate the whole multitude,\ndispersed all over the world, who profess to worship one God and Jesus\nChrist, who are initiated into his faith by baptism, who testify their\nunity in true doctrine and charity by a participation of the sacred\nsupper, who consent to the word of the Lord, and preserve the ministry\nwhich Christ has instituted for the purpose of preaching it. In this\nChurch are included many hypocrites, who have nothing of Christ but the\nname and appearance; many persons ambitious, avaricious, envious,\nslanderous, and dissolute in their lives, who are tolerated for a time,\neither because they cannot be convicted by a legitimate process, or\nbecause discipline is not always maintained with sufficient vigour. As\nit is necessary, therefore, to believe that Church, which is invisible\nto us, and known to God alone, so this Church, which is visible to men,\nwe are commanded to honour, and to maintain communion with it.\nVIII. As far, therefore, as was important for us to know it, the Lord\nhas described it by certain marks and characters. It is the peculiar\nprerogative of God himself to “know them that are his,”[740] as we have\nalready stated from Paul. And to guard against human presumption ever\ngoing to such an extreme, the experience of every day teaches us how\nvery far his secret judgments transcend all our apprehensions. For those\nwho seemed the most abandoned, and were generally considered past all\nhope, are recalled by his goodness into the right way; while some, who\nseemed to stand better than others, fall into perdition. “According to\nthe secret predestination of God,” therefore, as Augustine observes,\n“there are many sheep without the pale of the Church, and many wolves\nwithin.” For he knows and seals those who know not either him or\nthemselves. Of those who externally bear his seal, his eyes alone can\ndiscern who are unfeignedly holy, and will persevere to the end; which\nis the completion of salvation. On the other hand, as he saw it to be in\nsome measure requisite that we should know who ought to be considered as\nhis children, he has in this respect accommodated himself to our\ncapacity. And as it was not necessary that on this point we should have\nan assurance of faith, he has substituted in its place a judgment of\ncharity, according to which we ought to acknowledge as members of the\nChurch all those who by a confession of faith, an exemplary life, and a\nparticipation of the sacraments, profess the same God and Christ with\nourselves. But the knowledge of the body itself being more necessary to\nour salvation, he has distinguished it by more clear and certain\ncharacters.\nIX. Hence the visible Church rises conspicuous to our view. For wherever\nwe find the word of God purely preached and heard, and the sacraments\nadministered according to the institution of Christ, there, it is not to\nbe doubted, is a Church of God; for his promise can never deceive—“where\ntwo or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst\nof them.”[741] But, that we may have a clear understanding of the whole\nof this subject, let us proceed by the following steps: That the\nuniversal Church is the whole multitude, collected from all nations,\nwho, though dispersed in countries widely distant from each other,\nnevertheless consent to the same truth of Divine doctrine, and are\nunited by the bond of the same religion; that in this universal Church\nare comprehended particular churches, distributed according to human\nnecessity in various towns and villages; and that each of these\nrespectively is justly distinguished by the name and authority of a\nchurch; and that individuals, who, on a profession of piety, are\nenrolled among Churches of the same description, though they are really\nstrangers to any particular Church, do nevertheless in some respect\nbelong to it, till they are expelled from it by a public decision. There\nis some difference, however, in the mode of judging respecting private\npersons and churches. For it may happen, in the case of persons whom we\nthink altogether unworthy of the society of the pious, that, on account\nof the common consent of the Church, by which they are tolerated in the\nbody of Christ, we may be obliged to treat them as brethren, and to\nclass them in the number of believers. In our private opinion we approve\nnot of such persons as members of the Church, but we leave them the\nstation they hold among the people of God, till it be taken away from\nthem by legitimate authority. But respecting the congregation itself, we\nmust form a different judgment. If they possess and honour the ministry\nof the word, and the administration of the sacraments, they are, without\nall doubt, entitled to be considered as a Church; because it is certain\nthat the word and sacraments cannot be unattended with some good\neffects. In this manner, we preserve the unity of the universal Church,\nwhich diabolical spirits have always been endeavouring to destroy; and\nat the same time without interfering with the authority of those\nlegitimate assemblies, which local convenience has distributed in\ndifferent places.\nX. We have stated that the marks by which the Church is to be\ndistinguished, are, the preaching of the word and the administration of\nthe sacraments. For these can nowhere exist without bringing forth\nfruit, and being prospered with the blessing of God. I assert not that\nwherever the word is preached, the good effects of it immediately\nappear; but that it is never received so as to obtain a permanent\nestablishment, without displaying some efficacy. However this may be,\nwhere the word is heard with reverence, and the sacraments are not\nneglected, there we discover, while that is the case, an appearance of\nthe Church, which is liable to no suspicion of uncertainty, of which no\none can safely despise the authority, or reject the admonitions, or\nresist the counsels, or slight the censures, much less separate from it\nand break up its unity. For so highly does the Lord esteem the communion\nof his Church, that he considers every one as a traitor and apostate\nfrom religion, who perversely withdraws himself from any Christian\nsociety which preserves the true ministry of the word and sacraments. He\ncommends the authority of the Church, in such a manner as to account\nevery violation of it an infringement of his own. For it is not a\ntrivial circumstance, that the Church is called “the house of God, the\npillar and ground of truth.”[742] For in these words Paul signifies that\nin order to keep the truth of God from being lost in the world, the\nChurch is its faithful guardian; because it has been the will of God, by\nthe ministry of the Church, to preserve the pure preaching of his word,\nand to manifest himself as our affectionate Father, while he nourishes\nus with spiritual food, and provides all things conducive to our\nsalvation. Nor is it small praise, that the Church is chosen and\nseparated by Christ to be his spouse, “not having spot or wrinkle,”[743]\nto be “his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.”[744] Hence\nit follows, that a departure from the Church is a renunciation of God\nand Christ. And such a criminal dissension is so much the more to be\navoided, because, while we endeavour, as far as lies in our power, to\ndestroy the truth of God, we deserve to be crushed with the most\npowerful thunders of his wrath. Nor is it possible to imagine a more\natrocious crime, than that sacrilegious perfidy, which violates the\nconjugal relation that the only begotten Son of God has condescended to\nform with us.\nXI. Let us, therefore, diligently retain those characters impressed upon\nour minds, and estimate them according to the judgment of God. For there\nis nothing that Satan labours more to accomplish, than to remove and\ndestroy one or both of them; at one time to efface and obliterate these\nmarks, and so to take away all true and genuine distinction of the\nChurch; at another to inspire us with contempt of them, and so to drive\nus out of the Church by an open separation. By his subtlety it has\nhappened, that in some ages the pure preaching of the word has\naltogether disappeared; and in the present day he is labouring with the\nsame malignity to overturn the ministry; which, however, Christ has\nordained in his Church, so that if it were taken away, the edification\nof the Church would be quite at an end. How dangerous, then, how fatal\nis the temptation, when it even enters into the heart of a man to\nwithdraw himself from that congregation, in which he discovers those\nsigns and characters which the Lord has deemed sufficiently descriptive\nof his Church! We see, however, that great caution requires to be\nobserved on both sides. For, to prevent imposture from deceiving us,\nunder the name of the Church, every congregation assuming this name\nshould be brought to that proof, like gold to the touchstone. If it have\nthe order prescribed by the Lord in the word and sacraments, it will not\ndeceive us; we may securely render to it the honour due to all churches.\nOn the contrary, if it pretend to the name of a Church, without the word\nand sacraments, we ought to beware of such delusive pretensions, with as\nmuch caution as, in the other case, we should use in avoiding\npresumption and pride.\nXII. When we affirm the pure ministry of the word, and pure order in the\ncelebration of the sacraments, to be a sufficient pledge and earnest,\nthat we may safely embrace the society in which both these are found, as\na true Church, we carry the observation to this point, that such a\nsociety should never be rejected as long as it continues in those\nthings, although in other respects it may be chargeable with many\nfaults. It is possible, moreover, that some fault may insinuate itself\ninto the preaching of the doctrine, or the administration of the\nsacraments, which ought not to alienate us from its communion. For all\nthe articles of true doctrine are not of the same description. Some are\nso necessary to be known, that they ought to be universally received as\nfixed and indubitable principles, as the peculiar maxims of religion;\nsuch as, that there is one God; that Christ is God and the Son of God;\nthat our salvation depends on the mercy of God; and the like. There are\nothers, which are controverted among the churches, yet without\ndestroying the unity of the faith. For why should there be a division on\nthis point, if one church be of opinion, that souls, at their departure\nfrom their bodies, are immediately removed to heaven; and another church\nventure to determine nothing respecting their local situation, but be\nnevertheless firmly convinced, that they live to the Lord; and if this\ndiversity of sentiment on both sides be free from all fondness for\ncontention and obstinacy of assertion? The language of the apostle is,\n“Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in any\nthing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.”[745]\nDoes not this sufficiently show, that a diversity of opinion respecting\nthese nonessential points ought not to be a cause of discord among\nChristians? It is of importance, indeed, that we should agree in every\nthing; but as there is no person who is not enveloped with some cloud of\nignorance, either we must allow of no church at all, or we must forgive\nmistakes in those things, of which persons may be ignorant, without\nviolating the essence of religion, or incurring the loss of salvation.\nHere I would not be understood to plead for any errors, even the\nsmallest, or to recommend their being encouraged by connivance or\nflattery. But I maintain, that we ought not, on account of every trivial\ndifference of sentiment, to abandon the Church, which retains the saving\nand pure doctrine that insures the preservation of piety, and supports\nthe use of the sacraments instituted by our Lord. In the mean time, if\nwe endeavour to correct what we disapprove, we are acting in this case\naccording to our duty. And to this we are encouraged by the direction of\nPaul: “If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the\nfirst hold his peace.”[746] From which it appears, that every member of\nthe Church is required to exert himself for the general edification,\naccording to the measure of his grace, provided he do it decently and in\norder; that is to say, that we should neither forsake the communion of\nthe Church, nor, by continuing in it, disturb its peace and well\nregulated discipline.\nXIII. But in bearing with imperfections of life, we ought to carry our\nindulgence a great deal further. For this is a point in which we are\nvery liable to err, and here Satan lies in wait to deceive us with no\ncommon devices. For there have always been persons, who, from a false\nnotion of perfect sanctity, as if they were already become disembodied\nspirits, despised the society of all men in whom they could discover any\nremains of human infirmity. Such, in ancient times, were the Cathari,\nand also the Donatists, who approached to the same folly. Such, in the\npresent day, are some of the Anabaptists, who would be thought to have\nmade advances in piety beyond all others. There are others who err, more\nfrom an inconsiderate zeal for righteousness, than from this\nunreasonable pride. For when they perceive, that among those to whom the\ngospel is preached, its doctrine is not followed by correspondent\neffects in the life, they immediately pronounce, that there no church\nexists. This is, indeed, a very just ground of offence, and one for\nwhich we furnish more than sufficient occasion in the present unhappy\nage; nor is it possible to excuse our abominable inactivity, which the\nLord will not suffer to escape with impunity, and which he has already\nbegun to chastise with heavy scourges. Woe to us, therefore, who, by the\ndissolute licentiousness of our crimes, cause weak consciences to be\nwounded on our account! But, on the other hand, the error of the persons\nof whom we now speak, consists in not knowing how to fix any limits to\ntheir offence. For where our Lord requires the exercise of mercy, they\nentirely neglect it, and indulge themselves in immoderate severity.\nSupposing it impossible for the Church to exist, where there is not a\nperfect purity and integrity of life, through a hatred of crimes they\ndepart from the true Church, while they imagine themselves to be only\nwithdrawing from the factions of the wicked. They allege, that the\nChurch of Christ is holy. But that they may also understand, that it is\ncomposed of good and bad men mingled together, let them hear that\nparable from the lips of Christ, where it is compared to a net, in which\nfishes of all kinds are collected, and no separation is made till they\nare exposed on the shore.[747] Let them hear another parable, comparing\nthe Church to a field, which, after having been sown with good seed, is,\nby the craft of an enemy, corrupted with tares, from which it is never\ncleared till the harvest is brought into the barn.[748] Lastly, let them\nhear another comparison of the Church to a threshing-floor, in which the\nwheat is collected in such a manner, that it lies concealed under the\nchaff, till, after being carefully purged, by winnowing and sifting, it\nis at length laid up in the garner.[749] But if our Lord declares, that\nthe Church is to labour under this evil, and to be encumbered with a\nmixture of wicked men, even till the day of judgment, it is vain to seek\nfor a Church free from every spot.\nXIV. But they exclaim, that it is an intolerable thing that the\npestilence of crimes so generally prevails. I grant it would be happy if\nthe fact were otherwise; but in reply, I would present them with the\njudgment of the apostle. Among the Corinthians, more than a few had gone\nastray, and the infection had seized almost the whole society; there was\nnot only one species of sin, but many; and they were not trivial faults,\nbut dreadful crimes; and there was not only a corruption of morals, but\nalso of doctrine. In this case, what is the conduct of the holy apostle,\nthe organ of the heavenly Spirit, by whose testimony the Church stands\nor falls? Does he seek to separate from them? Does he reject them from\nthe kingdom of Christ? Does he strike them with the thunderbolt of the\nseverest anathema? He not only does none of these things, but, on the\ncontrary, acknowledges and speaks of them as a Church of Christ and a\nsociety of saints. If there remained a church among the Corinthians,\nwhere contentions, factions, and emulations were raging; where cupidity,\ndisputes, and litigations were prevailing; where a crime held in\nexecration even among the Gentiles, was publicly sanctioned; where the\nname of Paul, whom they ought to have revered as their father, was\ninsolently defamed; where some ridiculed the doctrine of the\nresurrection, with the subversion of which the whole gospel would be\nannihilated; where the graces of God were made subservient to ambition,\ninstead of charity; where many things were conducted without decency and\norder;[750] and if there still remained a Church, because the ministry\nof the word and sacraments was not rejected—who can refuse the name of a\nChurch to those who cannot be charged with a tenth part of those crimes?\nAnd those who display such violence and severity against the Churches of\nthe present age, I ask, how would they have conducted themselves towards\nthe Galatians, who almost entirely deserted the gospel, but among whom,\nnevertheless, the same apostle found Churches?[751]\nXV. They object that Paul bitterly reproves the Corinthians for\nadmitting an atrocious offender into their company, and follows this\nreproof with a general declaration, that with a man of scandalous life\nit is not lawful even to eat.[752] Here they exclaim, If it be not\nlawful to eat common bread with him, how can it be lawful to unite with\nhim in eating the bread of the Lord? I confess it is a great disgrace,\nif persons of immoral lives occupy places among the children of God; and\nif the sacred body of Christ be prostituted to them, the disgrace is\nvastly increased. And, indeed, if Churches be well regulated, they will\nnot suffer persons of abandoned characters among them, nor will they\npromiscuously admit the worthy and the unworthy to that sacred supper.\nBut because the pastors are not always so diligent in watching over\nthem, and sometimes exercise more indulgence than they ought, or are\nprevented from exerting the severity they would wish, it happens that\neven those who are openly wicked are not always expelled from the\nsociety of the saints. This I acknowledge to be a fault, nor have I any\ninclination to extenuate it, since Paul sharply reproves it in the\nCorinthians. But though the Church may be deficient in its duty, it does\nnot therefore follow that it is the place of every individual to pass\njudgment of separation for himself. I admit that it is the duty of a\npious man to withdraw himself from all private intimacy with the wicked,\nand not to involve himself in any voluntary connection with them. But it\nis one thing to avoid familiar intercourse with the wicked; and another\nthing, from hatred of them, to renounce the communion of the Church. And\npersons who deem it sacrilege to participate with them the bread of the\nLord, are in this respect far more rigid than Paul. For when he exhorts\nus to a pure and holy participation of it, he requires not one to\nexamine another, or every one to examine the whole Church, but each\nindividual to prove himself. If it were unlawful to communicate with an\nunworthy person, Paul would certainly have enjoined us to look around\nus, to see whether there were not some one in the multitude by whose\nimpurity we might be contaminated. But as he only requires every one to\nexamine himself, he shows that it is not the least injury to us if some\nunworthy persons intrude themselves with us. And this is fully implied\nin what he afterwards subjoins: “He that eateth and drinketh unworthily,\neateth and drinketh judgment to himself.”[753] He says, not to others,\nbut to himself, and with sufficient reason. For it ought not to be left\nto the judgment of every individual _who_ ought to be admitted into the\nChurch, and _who_ ought to be expelled from it. This authority belongs\nto the whole Church, and cannot be exercised without legitimate order,\nas will be stated more at large hereafter. It would be unjust,\ntherefore, that any individual should be contaminated with the\nunworthiness of another, whose approach it is neither in his power nor\nhis duty to prevent.\nXVI. But though this temptation sometimes arises even to good men, from\nan inconsiderate zeal for righteousness, yet we shall generally find\nthat excessive severity is more owing to pride and haughtiness, and a\nfalse opinion which persons entertain of their own superior sanctity,\nthan to true holiness, and a real concern for its interests. Those,\ntherefore, who are most daring in promoting a separation from the\nChurch, and act, as it were, as standard-bearers in the revolt, have in\ngeneral no other motive than to make an ostentatious display of their\nown superior excellence, and their contempt of all others. Augustine\ncorrectly and judiciously observes—“Whereas the pious rule and method of\necclesiastical discipline ought principally to regard the unity of the\nSpirit in the bond of peace, which the apostle enjoined to be preserved\nby mutual forbearance, and which not being preserved, the medicinal\npunishment is evinced to be not only superfluous, but even pernicious,\nand therefore to be no longer medicinal; those wicked children, who, not\nfrom a hatred of the iniquities of others, but from a fondness for their\nown contentions, earnestly endeavour to draw the simple and uninformed\nmultitude wholly after them, by entangling them with boasting of their\nown characters, or at least to divide them; those persons, I say,\ninflated with pride, infuriated with obstinacy, insidious in the\ncirculation of calumnies, and turbulent in raising seditions, conceal\nthemselves under the mask of a rigid severity, lest they should be\nproved to be destitute of the truth; and those things which in the Holy\nScriptures are commanded to be done with great moderation, and without\nviolating the sincerity of love, or breaking the unity of peace, for the\ncorrection of the faults of our brethren, they pervert to the sacrilege\nof schism, and an occasion of separation from the Church.” To pious and\npeaceable persons he gives this advice: that they should correct in\nmercy whatever they can; that what they cannot, they should patiently\nbear, and affectionately lament, till God either reform and correct it,\nor, at the harvest, root up the tares and sift out the chaff. All pious\npersons should study to fortify themselves with these counsels, lest,\nwhile they consider themselves as valiant and strenuous defenders of\nrighteousness, they depart from the kingdom of heaven, which is the only\nkingdom of righteousness. For since it is the will of God that the\ncommunion of his Church should be maintained in this external society,\nthose who, from an aversion to wicked men, destroy the token of that\nsociety, enter on a course in which they are in great danger of falling\nfrom the communion of saints. Let them consider, in the first place,\nthat in a great multitude there are many who escape their observation,\nwho, nevertheless, are truly holy and innocent in the sight of God.\nSecondly, let them consider, that of those who appear subject to moral\nmaladies, there are many who by no means please or flatter themselves in\ntheir vices, but are oftentimes aroused, with a serious fear of God, to\naspire to greater integrity. Thirdly, let them consider that judgment\nought not to be pronounced upon a man from a single act, since the\nholiest persons have sometimes most grievous falls. Fourthly, let them\nconsider, that the ministry of the word, and the participation of the\nsacraments, have too much influence in preserving the unity of the\nChurch, to admit of its being destroyed by the guilt of a few impious\nmen. Lastly, let them consider, that in forming an estimate of the\nChurch, the judgment of God is of more weight than that of man.\nXVII. When they allege that there must be some reason why the Church is\nsaid to be holy, it is necessary to examine the holiness in which it\nexcels; lest by refusing to admit the existence of a Church without\nabsolute and sinless perfection, we should leave no Church in the world.\nIt is true, that, as Paul tells us, “Christ loved the Church, and gave\nhimself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, by the washing of\nwater by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious\nChurch, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.”[754] It is\nnevertheless equally true, that the Lord works from day to day in\nsmoothing its wrinkles, and purging away its spots; whence it follows,\nthat its holiness is not yet perfect. The Church, therefore, is so far\nholy, that it is daily improving, but has not yet arrived at perfection;\nthat it is daily advancing, but has not yet reached the mark of\nholiness; as in another part of this work will be more fully explained.\nThe predictions of the prophets, therefore, that “Jerusalem shall be\nholy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more,” and that\nthe way of God shall be a “way of holiness, over which the unclean shall\nnot pass,”[755] are not to be understood as if there were no blemish\nremaining in any of the members of the Church; but because they aspire\nwith all their souls towards perfect holiness and purity, the goodness\nof God attributes to them that sanctity to which they have not yet fully\nattained. And though such evidences of sanctification are oftentimes\nrarely to be found among men, yet it must be maintained, that, from the\nfoundation of the world, there has never been a period in which God had\nnot his Church in it; and that, to the consummation of all things, there\nnever will be a time in which he will not have his Church. For although,\nin the very beginning of time, the whole human race was corrupted and\ndefiled by the sin of Adam; yet, from this polluted mass, God always\nsanctifies some vessels to honour, so that there is no age which has not\nexperienced his mercy. This he has testified by certain promises, such\nas the following: “I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn\nunto David, my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up\nthy throne to all generations.”[756] Again: “The Lord hath chosen Zion;\nhe hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever.”[757]\nAgain: “Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day,\nand the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night: If\nthose ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed of\nIsrael also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.”[758]\nXVIII. Of this truth Christ himself, the apostles, and almost all the\nprophets, have given us an example. Dreadful are those descriptions in\nwhich Isaiah, Jeremiah, Joel, Habakkuk, and others, deplore the\ndisorders of the Church of Jerusalem. There was such general and extreme\ncorruption in the people, in the magistrates, and in the priests, that\nIsaiah does not hesitate to compare Jerusalem to Sodom and Gomorrah.\nReligion was partly despised, partly corrupted. Their manners were\ngenerally disgraced by thefts, robberies, treacheries, murders, and\nsimilar crimes. Nevertheless, the prophets on this account neither\nraised themselves new churches, nor built new altars for the oblation of\nseparate sacrifices; but whatever were the characters of the people, yet\nbecause they considered that God had deposited his word among that\nnation, and instituted the ceremonies in which he was there worshipped,\nthey lifted up pure hands to him even in the congregation of the\nimpious. If they had thought that they contracted any contagion from\nthese services, surely they would have suffered a hundred deaths rather\nthan have permitted themselves to be dragged to them. There was nothing\ntherefore to prevent their departure from them, but the desire of\npreserving the unity of the Church. But if the holy prophets were\nrestrained by a sense of duty from forsaking the Church on account of\nthe numerous and enormous crimes which were practised, not by a few\nindividuals, but almost by the whole nation,—it is extreme arrogance in\nus, if we presume immediately to withdraw from the communion of a Church\nwhere the conduct of all the members is not compatible either with our\njudgment, or even with the Christian profession.\nXIX. Now, what kind of an age was that of Christ and his apostles? Yet\nthe desperate impiety of the Pharisees, and the dissolute lives every\nwhere led by the people, could not prevent _them_ from using the same\nsacrifices, and assembling in the same temple with others, for the\npublic exercises of religion. How did this happen, but from a knowledge\nthat the society of the wicked could not contaminate those who with pure\nconsciences united with them in the same solemnities? If any one pay no\ndeference to the prophets and apostles, let him at least acquiesce in\nthe authority of Christ. Cyprian has excellently remarked, “Although\ntares, or impure vessels, are found in the Church, yet this is not a\nreason why we should withdraw from it. It only behoves us to labour that\nwe may be the wheat, and to use our utmost endeavours and exertions,\nthat we may be vessels of gold or of silver. But to break in pieces the\nvessels of earth belongs to the Lord alone, to whom a rod of iron is\nalso given. Nor let any one arrogate to himself what is exclusively the\nprovince of the Son of God, by pretending to fan the floor, clear away\nthe chaff, and separate all the tares by the judgment of man. This is\nproud obstinacy and sacrilegious presumption, originating in a corrupt\nfrenzy.” Let these two points, then, be considered as decided; first,\nthat he who voluntarily deserts the external communion of the Church\nwhere the word of God is preached, and the sacraments are administered,\nis without any excuse; secondly, that the faults either of few persons\nor of many, form no obstacles to a due profession of our faith in the\nuse of the ceremonies instituted by God; because the pious conscience is\nnot wounded by the unworthiness of any other individual, whether he be a\npastor or a private person; nor are the mysteries less pure and salutary\nto a holy and upright man, because they are received at the same time by\nthe impure.\nXX. Their severity and haughtiness go to still greater lengths.\nAcknowledging no church but such as is pure from the smallest blemishes,\nthey are even angry with honest teachers, because, by exhorting\nbelievers to progressive improvements, they teach them to groan under\nthe burden of sins, and to seek for pardon all their lifetime. For\nhereby, they pretend, the people are drawn away from perfection. I\nconfess, that in urging men to perfection, we ought to labour with\nunremitting ardour and diligence; but to inspire their minds with a\npersuasion that they have already attained it, while they are yet in the\npursuit of it, I maintain to be a diabolical invention. Therefore, in\nthe Creed, _the communion of saints_ is immediately followed by _the\nforgiveness of sins_, which can only be obtained by the citizens and\nmembers of the Church, as we read in the prophet.[759] The heavenly\nJerusalem, therefore, ought first to be built, in which this favour of\nGod may be enjoyed, that whoever shall enter it, their iniquity shall be\nblotted out. Now, I affirm that this ought first to be built; not that\nthere can ever be any Church without remission of sins, but because God\nhas not promised to impart his mercy, except in the communion of saints.\nOur first entrance, therefore, into the Church and kingdom of God, is\nthe remission of sins, without which we have no covenant or union with\nGod. For thus he speaks by the prophet: “In that day will I make a\ncovenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of\nheaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the\nbow and the sword, and the battle out of the earth, and will make them\nto lie down safely. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I\nwill betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in\nloving-kindness, and in mercies.”[760] We see how God reconciles us to\nhimself by his mercy. So in another place, where he foretells the\nrestoration of the people whom he had scattered in his wrath, he says,\n“I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned\nagainst me.”[761] Wherefore it is by the sign of ablution, that we are\ninitiated into the society of his Church; by which we are taught that\nthere is no admittance for us into the family of God, unless our\npollution be first taken away by his goodness.\nXXI. Nor does God only once receive and adopt us into his Church by the\nremission of sins; he likewise preserves and keeps us in it by the same\nmercy. For to what purpose would it be, if we obtained a pardon which\nwould afterwards be of no use? And that the mercy of the Lord would be\nvain and delusive, if it were only granted for once, all pious persons\ncan testify to themselves; for every one of them is all his lifetime\nconscious of many infirmities, which need the Divine mercy. And surely\nit is not without reason, that God particularly promises this grace to\nthe members of his family, and commands the same message of\nreconciliation to be daily addressed to them. As we carry about with us\nthe relics of sin, therefore, as long as we live, we shall scarcely\ncontinue in the Church for a single moment, unless we are sustained by\nthe constant grace of the Lord in forgiving our sins. But the Lord has\ncalled his people to eternal salvation; they ought, therefore, to\nbelieve that his grace is always ready to pardon their sins. Wherefore\nit ought to be held as a certain conclusion, that from the Divine\nliberality, by the intervention of the merit of Christ, through the\nsanctification of the Spirit, pardon of sins has been, and is daily,\nbestowed upon us, who have been admitted and ingrafted into the body of\nthe Church.\nXXII. It was to dispense this blessing to us, that the keys were given\nto the Church.[762] For, when Christ gave commandment to his apostles,\nand conferred on them the power of remitting sins,[763] it was not with\nan intention that they should merely absolve from their sins those who\nwere converted from impiety to the Christian faith, but rather that they\nshould continually exercise this office among the faithful. This is\ntaught by Paul, when he says, that the message of reconciliation was\ncommitted to the ministers of the Church, that in the name of Christ\nthey might daily exhort the people to be reconciled to God.[764] In the\ncommunion of saints, therefore, sins are continually remitted to us by\nthe ministry of the Church, when the presbyters or bishops, to whom this\noffice is committed, confirm pious consciences, by the promises of the\ngospel, in the hope of pardon and remission; and that as well publicly\nas privately, according as necessity requires. For there are many\npersons who, on account of their infirmity, stand in need of separate\nand private consolation. And Paul tells us that he “taught,” not only\npublicly, but also “from house to house, testifying repentance toward\nGod, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ;”[765] and admonished every\nindividual separately respecting the doctrine of salvation. Here are\nthree things, therefore, worthy of our observation. First, that whatever\nholiness may distinguish the children of God, yet such is their\ncondition as long as they inhabit a mortal body, that they cannot stand\nbefore God without remission of sins. Secondly, that this benefit\nbelongs to the Church; so that we cannot enjoy it unless we continue in\nits communion. Thirdly, that it is dispensed to us by the ministers and\npastors of the Church, either in the preaching of the gospel, or in the\nadministration of the sacraments; and that this is the principal\nexercise of the power of the keys, which the Lord has conferred on the\nsociety of believers. Let every one of us, therefore, consider it as his\nduty, not to seek remission of sins any where but where the Lord has\nplaced it. Of public reconciliation, which is a branch of discipline, we\nshall speak in its proper place.\nXXIII. But as those fanatic spirits, of whom I spoke, endeavour to rob\nthe Church of this sole anchor of salvation, our consciences ought to be\nstill more strongly fortified against such a pestilent opinion. The\nNovatians disturbed the ancient Churches with this tenet; but the\npresent age also has witnessed some of the Anabaptists, who resemble the\nNovatians by falling into the same follies. For they imagine that by\nbaptism the people of God are regenerated to a pure and angelic life,\nwhich cannot be contaminated by any impurities of the flesh. And if any\none be guilty of sin after baptism, they leave him no prospect of\nescaping the inexorable judgment of God. In short, they encourage no\nhope of pardon in any one who sins after having received the grace of\nGod; because they acknowledge no other remission of sins than that by\nwhich we are first regenerated. Now, though there is no falsehood more\nclearly refuted in the Scripture than this, yet because its advocates\nfind persons to submit to their impositions, as Novatus formerly had\nnumerous followers, let us briefly show how very pernicious their error\nis both to themselves and to others. In the first place, when the saints\nobey the command of the Lord by a daily repetition of this prayer,\n“forgive us our debts,”[766] they certainly confess themselves to be\nsinners. Nor do they pray in vain, for our Lord has not enjoined the use\nof any petitions, but such as he designed to grant. And after he had\ndeclared that the whole prayer would be heard by the Father, he\nconfirmed this absolution by a special promise. What do we want more?\nThe Lord requires from the saints a confession of sins, and that daily\nas long as they live, and he promises them pardon. What presumption is\nit either to assert that they are exempt from sin, or, if they have\nfallen, to exclude them from all grace! To whom does he enjoin us to\ngrant forgiveness seventy times seven times? Is it not to our brethren?\nAnd what was the design of this injunction, but that we might imitate\nhis clemency? He pardons, therefore, not once or twice, but as often as\nthe sinner is alarmed with a sense of his sins, and sighs for mercy.\nXXIV. But to begin from the infancy of the Church: the patriarchs had\nbeen circumcised, admitted to the privileges of the covenant, and\nwithout doubt instructed in justice and integrity by the care of their\nfather, when they conspired to murder their brother. This was a crime to\nbe abominated even by the most desperate and abandoned robbers. At\nlength, softened by the admonitions of Judah, they sold him for a slave.\nThis also was an intolerable cruelty. Simon and Levi, in a spirit of\nnefarious revenge, condemned even by the judgment of their father,\nmurdered the inhabitants of Sichem. Reuben was guilty of execrable\nincest with his father’s concubine. Judah, with an intention of\nindulging a libidinous passion, violated the law of nature by a criminal\nconnection with his son’s wife. Yet they are so far from being expunged\nout of the number of the chosen people, that, on the contrary, they are\nconstituted the heads of the nation.[767] What shall we say of David?\nThough he was the official guardian of justice, how scandalously did he\nprepare the way for the gratification of a blind passion, by the\neffusion of innocent blood! He had already been regenerated, and among\nthe regenerate had been distinguished by the peculiar commendations of\nthe Lord; yet he perpetrated a crime even among heathens regarded with\nhorror, and yet he obtained mercy.[768] And not to dwell any longer on\nparticular examples, the numerous promises which the law and the\nprophets contain, of Divine mercy towards the Israelites, are so many\nproofs of the manifestation of God’s placability to the offences of his\npeople. For what does Moses promise to the people in case of their\nreturn to the Lord, after having fallen into idolatry? “Then the Lord\nthy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will\nreturn and gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord thy God\nhath scattered thee. If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost\nparts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee.”[769]\nXXV. But I am unwilling to commence an enumeration which would have no\nend. For the prophets are full of such promises, which offer mercy to\nthe people, though covered with innumerable crimes. What sin is worse\nthan rebellion? It is described as a divorce between God and the Church:\nyet this is overcome by the goodness of God. Hear his language by the\nmouth of Jeremiah: “If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and\nbecome another man’s, shall he return unto her again? Shall not that\nland be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many\nlovers, and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy\nwickedness. Yet return again to me, thou backsliding Israel, saith the\nLord, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you; for I am\nmerciful, saith the Lord, and will not keep anger for ever.”[770] And\nsurely there cannot possibly be any other disposition in him who\naffirms, that he “hath no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that\nthe wicked turn from his way and live.”[771] Therefore, when Solomon\ndedicated the temple, he appointed it also for this purpose, that\nprayers, offered to obtain pardon of sins, might there be heard and\nanswered. His words are, “If they sin against thee, (for there is no man\nthat sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the\nenemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy,\nfar or near; yet if they shall bethink themselves, and repent in the\nland whither they were carried captives, and repent and make\nsupplication unto thee in the land of those that carried them captives,\nsaying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed\nwickedness; and pray unto thee toward the land which thou gavest unto\ntheir fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I\nhave built for thy name; then hear thou their prayer and their\nsupplication in heaven, and forgive thy people that have sinned against\nthee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed\nagainst thee.”[772] Nor was it without cause that in the law the Lord\nordained daily sacrifices for sins; for unless he had foreseen that his\npeople would be subject to the maladies of daily sins, he would never\nhave appointed these remedies.[773]\nXXVI. Now, I ask whether, by the advent of Christ, in whom the fulness\nof grace was displayed, believers have been deprived of this benefit, so\nthat they can no longer presume to supplicate for the pardon of their\nsins; so that if they offend against the Lord, they can obtain no mercy.\nWhat would this be but to affirm, that Christ came for the destruction\nof his people, and not for their salvation; if the loving-kindness of\nGod, in the pardon of sins, which was continually ready to be exercised\nto the saints under the Old Testament, be maintained to be now entirely\nwithdrawn? But if we give any credit to the Scriptures, which proclaim\nthat in Christ the grace and philanthropy of God have at length been\nfully manifested, that his mercy has been abundantly diffused, and\nreconciliation between God and man accomplished,[774] we ought not to\ndoubt that the clemency of our heavenly Father is displayed to us in\ngreater abundance, rather than restricted or diminished. Examples to\nprove this are not wanting. Peter, who had been warned that he who would\nnot confess the name of Christ before men would be denied by him before\nangels, denied him three times in one night, and accompanied the denial\nwith execrations; yet he was not refused pardon.[775] Those of the\nThessalonians who led disorderly lives, are reprehended by the apostle,\nin order to be invited to repentance.[776] Nor does Peter drive Simon\nMagus himself to despair; but rather directs him to cherish a favourable\nhope, when he persuades him to pray for forgiveness.[777]\nXXVII. What are we to say of cases in which the most enormous sins have\nsometimes seized whole Churches? From this situation Paul rather\nmercifully reclaimed them, than abandoned them to the curse. The\ndefection of the Galatians was no trivial offence.[778] The Corinthians\nwere still less excusable, their crimes being more numerous and equally\nenormous.[779] Yet neither are excluded from the mercy of the Lord: on\nthe contrary, the very persons who had gone beyond all others in\nimpurity, unchastity, and fornication, are expressly invited to\nrepentance. For the covenant of the Lord will ever remain eternal and\ninviolable, which he has made with Christ, the antitype of Solomon, and\nwith all his members, in these words: “If his children forsake my law,\nand walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my\ncommandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and\ntheir iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not\nutterly take from him.”[780] Finally, the order of the Creed teaches us\nthat pardon of sins ever continues in the Church of Christ, because,\nafter having mentioned the Church, it immediately adds _the forgiveness\nof sins_.\nXXVIII. Some persons, who are a little more judicious, perceiving the\nnotion of Novatus to be so explicitly contradicted by the Scripture, do\nnot represent every sin as unpardonable, but only voluntary\ntransgression, into which a person may have fallen with the full\nexercise of his knowledge and will. These persons admit of no pardon for\nany sins, but such as may have been the mere errors of ignorance. But as\nthe Lord, in the law, commanded some sacrifices to be offered to expiate\nthe voluntary sins of believers, and others to atone for sins of\nignorance, what extreme presumption is it to deny that there is any\npardon for voluntary transgression! I maintain, that there is nothing\nmore evident, than that the one sacrifice of Christ is available for the\nremission of the voluntary sins of the saints, since the Lord has\ntestified the same by the legal victims, as by so many types. Besides,\nwho can plead ignorance as an excuse for David, who was evidently so\nwell acquainted with the law? Did not David know that adultery and\nmurder were great crimes, which he daily punished in others? Did the\npatriarchs consider fratricide as lawful? Had the Corinthians learned so\nlittle that they could imagine impurity, incontinence, fornication,\nanimosities, and contentions, to be pleasing to God? Could Peter, who\nhad been so carefully warned, be ignorant how great a crime it was to\nabjure his Master? Let us not, therefore, by our cruelty, shut the gate\nof mercy which God has so liberally opened.\nXXIX. I am fully aware that the old writers have explained those sins,\nwhich are daily forgiven to believers, to be the smaller faults, which\nare inadvertently committed through the infirmity of the flesh; but\nsolemn repentance, which was then required for greater offences, they\nthought, was no more to be repeated than baptism. This sentiment is not\nto be understood as indicating their design, either to drive into\ndespair such persons as had relapsed after their first repentance, or to\nextenuate those errors, as if they were small in the sight of God. For\nthey knew that the saints frequently stagger through unbelief; that they\nsometimes utter unnecessary oaths; that they occasionally swell into\nanger, and even break out into open reproaches; and that they are\nlikewise chargeable with other faults, which the Lord holds in the\ngreatest abomination. They expressed themselves in this manner, to\ndistinguish between private offences and those public crimes which were\nattended with great scandal in the Church. But the difficulty, which\nthey made, of forgiving those who had committed any thing deserving of\necclesiastical censure, did not arise from an opinion that it was\ndifficult for them to obtain pardon from the Lord; they only intended by\nthis severity to deter others from rashly running into crimes, which\nwould justly be followed by their exclusion from the communion of the\nChurch. The word of the Lord, however, which ought to be our only rule\nin this case, certainly prescribes greater moderation. For it teaches,\nthat the rigour of discipline ought not to be carried to such an extent,\nas to overwhelm with sorrow the person whose benefit we are required to\nregard as its principal object; as we have before shown more at large.\nFootnote 703:\nEphes. iv. 11-16.\nFootnote 704:\nMark x. 9.\nFootnote 705:\nGal. iv. 26.\nFootnote 706:\n2 Tim. ii. 19.\nFootnote 707:\nRom. xi. 4. 1 Kings xix. 18.\nFootnote 708:\nActs iv. 32.\nFootnote 709:\nEphes. iv. 4.\nFootnote 710:\nJoel ii. 32.

          "title": "CHAPTER II.",
          "content": "THE TRUE AND FALSE CHURCH COMPARED.\nWe have already stated the importance which we ought to attach to the\nministry of the word and sacraments, and the extent to which our\nreverence for it ought to be carried, so as to account it a perpetual\nmark and characteristic of the Church. That is to say, that wherever\n_that_ exists entire and uncorrupted, no errors and irregularities of\nconduct form a sufficient reason for refusing the name of a Church. In\nthe next place, that the ministry itself is not so far vitiated by\nsmaller errors, as to be considered on that account less legitimate. It\nhas further been shown, that the errors which are entitled to this\nforgiveness are those by which the grand doctrine of religion is not\ninjured, which do not suppress the points in which all believers ought\nto agree as articles of faith, and which, in regard to the sacraments,\nneither abolish nor subvert the legitimate institution of their Author.\nBut as soon as falsehood has made a breach in the fundamentals of\nreligion, and the system of necessary doctrine is subverted, and the use\nof the sacraments fails, the certain consequence is the ruin of the\nChurch, as there is an end of a man’s life when his throat is cut, or\nhis heart is mortally wounded. And this is evident from the language of\nPaul, when he declares the Church to be “built upon the foundation of\nthe apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief\ncorner-stone.”[781] If the foundation of the Church be the doctrine of\nthe prophets and apostles, which enjoins believers to place their\nsalvation in Christ alone, how can the edifice stand any longer, when\nthat doctrine is taken away? The Church, therefore, must of necessity\nfall, where that system of religion is subverted which alone is able to\nsustain it. Besides, if the true Church be “the pillar and ground of\ntruth,”[782] that certainly can be no Church where delusion and\nfalsehood have usurped the dominion.\nII. As this is the state of things under the Papacy, it is easy to judge\nhow much of the Church remains there. Instead of the ministry of the\nword, there reigns a corrupt government, composed of falsehoods, by\nwhich the pure light is suppressed or extinguished. An execrable\nsacrilege has been substituted for the supper of the Lord. The worship\nof God is deformed by a multifarious and intolerable mass of\nsuperstitions. The doctrine, without which Christianity cannot exist,\nhas been entirely forgotten or exploded. The public assemblies have\nbecome schools of idolatry and impiety. In withdrawing ourselves,\ntherefore, from the pernicious participation of so many enormities,\nthere is no danger of separating ourselves from the Church of Christ.\nThe communion of the Church was not instituted as a bond to confine us\nin idolatry, impiety, ignorance of God, and other evils; but rather as a\nmean to preserve us in the fear of God, and obedience of the truth. I\nknow that the Papists give us the most magnificent commendations of\ntheir Church, to make us believe that there is no other in the world;\nand then, as if they had gained their point, they conclude all who dare\nto withdraw themselves from that Church which they describe, to be\nschismatics, and pronounce all to be heretics who venture to open their\nmouths in opposition to its doctrine. But by what reasons do they prove\ntheirs to be the true Church? They allege from ancient records what\nformerly occurred in Italy, in France, in Spain; that they are descended\nfrom those holy men, who by sound doctrine founded and raised the\nChurches in these countries, and confirmed their doctrine and the\nedification of the Church by their blood; and that the Church, thus\nconsecrated among them, both by spiritual gifts, and by the blood of\nmartyrs, has been preserved by a perpetual succession of bishops, that\nit might never be lost. They allege the importance attached to this\nsuccession by Irenæus, Tertullian, Origen, Augustine, and others. To\nthose who are willing to attend me in a brief examination of these\nallegations, I will clearly show that they are frivolous, and manifestly\nridiculous. I would likewise exhort those who advance them, to pay a\nserious attention to the subject, if I thought my arguments could\nproduce any effect upon them; but as their sole object is to promote\ntheir own interest by every method in their power, without any regard to\ntruth, I shall content myself with making a few observations, with which\ngood men, and inquirers after truth, may be able to answer their cavils.\nIn the first place, I ask them, why they allege nothing respecting\nAfrica, and Egypt, and all Asia. It is because, in all those countries,\nthere has been a failure of this sacred succession of bishops, by virtue\nof which they boast that the Church has been preserved among them. They\ncome to this point, therefore, that they have the true Church, because\nfrom its commencement it has never been destitute of bishops, for that\nsome have been succeeded by others in an uninterrupted series. But what\nif I oppose them with the example of Greece? I ask them again,\ntherefore, why they assert that the Church has been lost among the\nGreeks, among whom there has never been any interruption of that\nsuccession of bishops, which they consider as the sole guard and\npreservative of the Church? They call the Greeks schismatics. For what\nreason? Because, it is pretended, they have lost their privilege by\nrevolting from the Apostolical see. But do not they much more deserve to\nlose it, who have revolted from Christ himself? It follows, therefore,\nthat their plea of uninterrupted succession is a vain pretence, unless\nthe truth of Christ, which was transmitted from the fathers, be\npermanently retained pure and uncorrupted by their posterity.\nIII. The pretensions of the Romanists, therefore, in the present day,\nare no other than those which appear to have been formerly set up by the\nJews, when they were reproved by the prophets of the Lord for blindness,\nimpiety, and idolatry. For as the Jews boasted of the temple, the\nceremonies, and the priesthood, in which things they firmly believed the\nChurch to consist; so, instead of the Church, the Papists produce\ncertain external forms, which are often at a great distance from the\nChurch, and are not at all necessary to its existence. Wherefore we need\nno other argument to refute them, than that which was urged by Jeremiah\nagainst that foolish confidence of the Jews: “Trust ye not in lying\nwords, saying, The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the\ntemple of the Lord, are these.”[783] For the Lord acknowledges no place\nas his temple, where his word is not heard and devoutly observed. So,\nthough the glory of God resided between the cherubim in the sanctuary,\nand he had promised his people that he would make it his permanent seat,\nyet when the priests had corrupted his worship by perverse\nsuperstitions, he departed, and left the place without any sanctity. If\nthat temple which appeared to be consecrated to the perpetual residence\nof God, could be forsaken and desecrated by him, there can be no reason\nfor their pretending that God is so attached to persons or places, or\nconfined to external observances, as to be constrained to remain among\nthose who have nothing but the name and appearance of the Church. And\nthis is the argument which is maintained by Paul in the Epistle to the\nRomans, from the ninth chapter to the twelfth. For it had violently\ndisturbed weak consciences, to observe that, while the Jews appeared to\nbe the people of God, they not only rejected, but also persecuted, the\ndoctrine of the gospel. Therefore, after having discussed that doctrine,\nhe removes this difficulty; and denies the claim of those Jews, who were\nenemies of the truth, to be considered as the Church, though in other\nrespects they wanted nothing that could be requisite to its external\nform. And the only reason for this denial was, because they did not\nreceive Christ. He speaks rather more explicitly in the Epistle to the\nGalatians,[784] where, in a comparison between Ishmael and Isaac, he\nrepresents many as occupying a place in the Church, who have no right to\nthe inheritance, because they are not the children of a free mother.\nHence he proceeds to a contrast of the two Jerusalems, because as the\nlaw was given on Mount Sinai, but the gospel came forth from Jerusalem,\nso many who have been born and educated in bondage, confidently boast of\nbeing the children of God and of the Church, and though they are\nthemselves a spurious offspring, look down with contempt on his genuine\nand legitimate children. But as for us, on the contrary, who have once\nheard it proclaimed from heaven, “Cast out the bondwoman and her son,”\nlet us confide in this inviolable decree, and resolutely despise their\nridiculous pretensions. For if they pride themselves on an external\nprofession, Ishmael also was circumcised. If they depend on antiquity,\nhe was the first born. Yet we see that he was rejected. If the cause of\nthis be inquired, Paul tells us that none are accounted children but\nthose who are born of the pure and legitimate seed of the word.[785]\nAccording to this reason, the Lord declares that he is not confined to\nimpious priests, because he had made a covenant with their father Levi\nto be his angel or messenger.[786] He even retorts on them their false\nboasting, with which they were accustomed to oppose the prophets, that\nthe dignity of the priesthood ought to be held in peculiar estimation.\nThis he readily admits, and argues with them on this ground, because he\nwas prepared to observe the covenant, whereas they failed of discharging\nthe correspondent obligations, and therefore deserved to be rejected.\nSee, then, what such succession is worth, unless it be connected with a\ncontinual imitation and conformity. Without this, the descendants, who\nare convicted of a departure from their predecessors, must immediately\nbe deprived of all honour; unless, indeed, because Caiaphas was the\nsuccessor of many pious priests, and there had been an uninterrupted\nseries even from Aaron to him, that execrable assembly be deemed worthy\nto be called the Church. But it would not be tolerated even in earthly\ngovernments, that the tyranny of Caligula, Nero, Heliogabalus, and\nothers, should be called the true state of the republic, because they\nsucceeded the Bruti, the Scipios, and the Camilli. But in regard to the\ngovernment of the Church, nothing can be more frivolous than to place\nthe succession in the persons, to the neglect of the doctrine. And\nnothing was further from the intentions of the holy doctors, whose\nauthority they falsely obtrude upon us, than to prove that Churches\nexisted by a kind of hereditary right, wherever there has been a\nconstant succession of bishops. But as it was beyond all doubt that,\nfrom the beginning even down to their times, no change had taken place\nin the doctrine, they assumed, what would suffice for the confutation of\nall new errors, that they were repugnant to the doctrine which had been\nconstantly and unanimously maintained even from the days of the\napostles. They will gain nothing, therefore, by persisting to disguise\nthemselves under the name of the Church. The Church we regard with\nbecoming reverence; but when they come to the definition, they are\nmiserably embarrassed, for they substitute an execrable harlot in the\nplace of the holy spouse of Christ. That we may not be deceived by such\na substitution, beside other admonitions, let us remember this of\nAugustine; for, speaking of the Church, he says, “It is sometimes\nobscured and beclouded by a multitude of scandals; sometimes it appears\nquiet and unmolested in a season of tranquillity, and is sometimes\ndisturbed and overwhelmed with the waves of tribulations and\ntemptations.” He produces examples, that those who were its firmest\npillars, have either undauntedly suffered banishment on account of the\nfaith, or secluded themselves from all society.\nIV. In the same manner, the Romanists in the present day harass us, and\nterrify ignorant persons with the name of the Church, though there are\nno greater enemies to Christ than themselves. Although they may pretend\ntherefore to the temple, the priesthood, and other similar forms, this\nvain glitter, which dazzles the eyes of the simple, ought by no means to\ninduce us to admit the existence of a Church, where we cannot discover\nthe word of God. For this is the perpetual mark by which our Lord has\ncharacterized his people: “Every one that is of the truth heareth my\nvoice.”[787] And, “I am the good Shepherd, and know my sheep, and am\nknown of mine.” “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they\nfollow me.” He had just before said, “The sheep follow their shepherd;\nfor they know his voice; and a stranger will they not follow, but will\nflee from him, for they know not the voice of strangers.”[788] Why,\nthen, do we wilfully run into error in forming a judgment of the Church,\nsince Christ has designated it by an unequivocal character, that\nwherever it is discovered, it infallibly assures us of the existence of\na Church, and wherever it is wanting, there is no real evidence of a\nChurch left. For Paul declares the Church to be founded, not upon the\nopinions of men, not upon the priesthood, but upon the “doctrine of the\napostles and prophets.”[789] And Jerusalem is to be distinguished from\nBabylon, the Church of Christ from the synagogue of Satan, by this\ndifference, by which Christ has discriminated them from each other: “He\nthat is of God, heareth God’s words; ye therefore hear them not, because\nye are not of God.”[790] In fine, as the Church is the kingdom of\nChrist, and he reigns only by his word, can any person doubt the\nfalsehood of those pretensions, which represent the kingdom of Christ as\ndestitute of his sceptre, that is, of his holy word?\nV. With respect to the charge which they bring against us of heresy and\nschism, because we preach a different doctrine from theirs, and submit\nnot to their laws, and hold separate assemblies for prayers, for\nbaptism, for the administration of the Lord’s supper, and other sacred\nexercises, it is indeed a most heavy accusation, but such as by no means\nrequires a long or laborious defence. The appellations of heretics and\nschismatics are applied to persons who cause dissension, and destroy the\ncommunion of the Church. Now, this communion is preserved by two\nbonds—agreement in sound doctrine, and brotherly love. Between heretics\nand schismatics, therefore, Augustine makes the following\ndistinction—that the former corrupt the purity of the faith by false\ndoctrines, and that the latter break the bond of affection, sometimes\neven while they retain the same faith. But it is also to be remarked,\nthat this union of affection is dependent on the unity of faith, as its\nfoundation, end, and rule. Let us remember, therefore, that, whenever\nthe unity of the Church is enjoined upon us in the Scripture, it is\nrequired, that, while our minds hold the same doctrines in Christ, our\nwills should likewise be united in mutual benevolence in Christ.\nTherefore, Paul, when he exhorts us to it, assumes as a foundation, that\nthere is “one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.”[791] And when he\ninculcates our being “like-minded, and having the same love, being of\none accord, of one mind,”[792] he immediately adds, that this should be\nin Christ, or according to Christ; signifying that all union which is\nformed without the word of the Lord, is a faction of the impious, and\nnot an association of believers.\nVI. Cyprian, also, after the example of Paul, deduces the origin of all\necclesiastical concord from the supreme bishopric of Christ. He\nafterwards subjoins, “There is but one Church, which is widely extended\ninto a multitude by the offspring of its fertility; just as there are\nmany rays of the sun, but the light is one; and a tree has many\nbranches, but only one trunk, fixed on a firm root. And when many rivers\nissue from one source, though by its exuberant abundance the stream is\nmultiplied into numerous currents, yet the unity of the fountain still\nremains. Separate a ray from the body of the sun, and its unity sustains\nno division. Break off a branch from a tree, and the broken branch can\nnever bud. Cut off a river from the source, and it immediately dries up.\nSo the Church, overspread with the light of the Lord, is extended over\nthe whole world: yet it is one and the same light which is universally\ndiffused.” No representation could be more elegant to express that\ninseparable connection which subsists between all the members of Christ.\nWe see how he continually recalls us to the fountain-head. Therefore he\npronounces the origin of heresies and schisms to be, that men neither\nreturn to the source of truth, nor seek the Head, nor attend to the\ndoctrine of the heavenly Master. Now, let the Romanists exclaim that we\nare heretics, because we have withdrawn from their church; while the\nsole cause of our secession has been, that theirs cannot possibly be the\npure profession of the truth. I say nothing of their having expelled us\nwith anathemas and execrations. But this reason is more than sufficient\nfor our exculpation, unless they are determined to pronounce sentence of\nschism also against the apostles, with whom we have but one common\ncause. Christ, I say, foretold to his apostles, that for his name’s sake\nthey should be cast out of the synagogues.[793] Now, those synagogues,\nof which he spoke, were then accounted legitimate Churches. Since it is\nevident, then, that we have been cast out, and we are prepared to prove\nthat this has been done for the name of Christ, it is necessary to\ninquire into the cause, before any thing be determined respecting us,\neither on one side or the other. But this point I readily relinquish to\nthem. It is sufficient for me that it was necessary for us to withdraw\nfrom them, in order to approach to Christ.\nVII. But it will be still more evident, in what estimation we ought to\nhold all the Churches who have submitted to the tyranny of the Roman\npontiff, if we compare them with the ancient Church of Israel, as\ndelineated by the prophets. There was a true Church among the Jews and\nthe Israelites, while they continued to observe the laws of the\ncovenant; because they then obtained from the favour of God those things\nwhich constitute a Church. They had the doctrine of truth in the law;\nthe ministry of it was committed to the priests and prophets; they were\ninitiated into the Church by the sign of circumcision; and were\nexercised in other sacraments for the confirmation of their faith. There\nis no doubt that the commendations, with which the Lord has honoured his\nChurch, truly belonged to their society. But after they deserted the law\nof the Lord, and fell into idolatry and superstition, they partly lost\nthis privilege. For who would dare to refuse the title of a Church to\nthose among whom God deposited the preaching of his word, and the\nobservance of his mysteries? On the other hand, who would dare to give\nthe appellation of a Church, without any exception, to that society,\nwhere the word of God is openly and fearlessly trampled under foot;\nwhere its ministry, the principal sinew, and even the soul of the\nChurch, is discontinued?\nVIII. What, then, it will be said, was there no particle of a Church\nleft among the Jews from the moment of their defection to idolatry? The\nanswer is easy. In the first place, I observe, that in this defection\nthere were several degrees. Nor will we maintain the fall of Judah, and\nthat of Israel, to have been exactly the same, at the time when they\nboth began to depart from the pure worship of God. When Jeroboam made\nthe calves, in opposition to the express prohibition of God, and\ndedicated a place which it was not lawful to use for the oblation of\nsacrifices, in this case religion was totally corrupted. The Jews\npolluted themselves with practical impieties and superstitions, before\nthey made any unlawful changes in the external forms of religion. For\nthough they generally adopted many corrupt ceremonies in the time of\nRehoboam, yet as the doctrine of the law, and the priesthood, and the\nrites which God had instituted, were still preserved at Jerusalem,\nbelievers had in that kingdom a tolerable form of a Church. Among the\nIsraelites, there was no reformation down to the reign of Ahab, and in\nhis time there was an alteration for the worse. Of the succeeding kings,\neven to the subversion of the kingdom, some resembled Ahab, and others,\nwho would be a little better, followed the example of Jeroboam; but all,\nwithout exception, were impious idolaters. In Judah there were various\nchanges; some kings corrupted the worship of God with false and\ngroundless superstitions, and others restored religion from its abuses;\ntill, at length, the priests themselves polluted the temple of God with\nidolatrous and abominable rites.\nIX. Now, however the Papists may extenuate their vices, let them deny,\nif they can, that the state of religion is as corrupt and depraved among\nthem, as it was in the kingdom of Israel, in the time of Jeroboam. But\nthey practise a grosser idolatry, and their doctrine is equally, if not\nmore, impure. God is my witness, and all men who are endued with\nmoderate judgment, and the fact itself declares, that in this I am\nguilty of no exaggeration. Now, when they try to drive us into the\ncommunion of their Church, they require two things of us—first, that we\nshould communicate in all their prayers, sacraments, and ceremonies;\nsecondly, that whatever honour, power, and jurisdiction, Christ has\nconferred upon his Church, we should attribute the same to theirs. With\nrespect to the first point, I confess that the prophets who were at\nJerusalem, when the state of affairs there was very corrupt, neither\noffered up sacrifices apart from others, nor held separate assemblies\nfor prayer. For they had the express command of God, that they were to\nassemble in the temple of Solomon; and they knew that the Levitical\npriests, because they had been ordained by the Lord as ministers of the\nsacrifices, and had not been deposed, however unworthy they might be of\nsuch honour, still retained the lawful possession of that place. But,\nwhat is the principal point of the whole controversy, they were not\nconstrained to join in any superstitious worship; on the contrary, they\nengaged in no service that was not of Divine institution. But what\nresemblance is there to this among the Papists? We can scarcely assemble\nwith them on a single occasion, without polluting ourselves with open\nidolatry. The principal bond of their communion is certainly the mass,\nwhich we abominate as the greatest sacrilege. Whether we are right or\nwrong in this, will be seen in another place. It is sufficient, at\npresent, to show that, in this respect, our case is different from that\nof the prophets, who, though they were present at the sacrifices of\nimpious persons, were never compelled to use, or to witness, any\nceremonies but those which God had instituted. And if we wish to have an\nexample entirely similar, we must take it from the kingdom of Israel.\nAccording to the regulations of Jeroboam, circumcision continued,\nsacrifices were offered, the law was regarded as sacred, the people\ninvoked the same God whom their fathers had worshipped; yet, on account\nof novel ceremonies invented in opposition to the Divine prohibitions,\nGod disapproved and condemned all that was done there. Show me a single\nprophet, or any pious man, who even once worshipped or offered sacrifice\nat Bethel. They knew that they could not do it without contaminating\nthemselves with sacrilege. We have established this point, therefore,\nthat the attachment of pious persons to the communion of the Church,\nought not to be carried to such an extent, as to oblige them to remain\nin it, if it degenerated into profane and impure rites.\nX. But against their second requisition, we contend upon still stronger\nground. For if the Church be held in such consideration that we are\nrequired to revere its judgment, to obey its authority, to receive its\nadmonitions, to fall under its censures, and scrupulously and uniformly\nto adhere to its communion, we cannot allow their claim to the character\nof the Church, without necessarily obliging ourselves to subjection and\nobedience. Yet we readily concede to them what the prophets conceded to\nthe Jews and Israelites of their time, when things among them were in a\nsimilar, or even in a better state. But we see how they frequently\nexclaim, that their assemblies were iniquitous meetings,[794] a\nconcurrence in which were as criminal as a renunciation of God. And\ncertainly, if those assemblies were Churches, it follows that Elijah,\nMicaiah, and others in Israel, were strangers to the Church of God; and\nthe same would be true of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, and others of that\ndescription in Judah, whom the false prophets, priests, and people of\ntheir day, hated and execrated as if they had been worse than any\nheathens. If such assemblies were Churches, then the Church is not the\npillar of truth, but a foundation of falsehood, not the sanctuary of the\nliving God, but a receptacle of idols. They found themselves under a\nnecessity, therefore, of withdrawing from all connection with those\nassemblies, which were nothing but a conspiracy against God. For the\nsame reason, if any one acknowledges the assemblies of the present day,\nwhich are contaminated with idolatry, superstition, and false doctrine,\nas true Churches, in full communion with which a Christian man ought to\ncontinue, and in whose doctrine he ought to coincide, this will be a\ngreat error. For if they be Churches, they possess the power of the\nkeys; but the keys are inseparably connected with the word, which is\nexploded from among them. Again, if they be Churches, that promise of\nChrist must be applicable to them—“Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth\nshall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall\nbe loosed in heaven.”[795] On the contrary, all who sincerely profess\nthemselves to be the servants of Christ, they expel from their\ncommunion. Either, therefore, the promise of Christ must be vain, or in\nthis respect they are not Churches. Lastly, instead of the ministry of\nthe word, they have schools of impiety, and a gulf of every species of\nerrors. Either, therefore, in this respect they are not Churches, or no\nmark will be left to distinguish the legitimate assemblies of believers\nfrom the conventions of Turks.\nXI. Nevertheless, as in former times the Jews continued in possession of\nsome peculiar privileges of the Church, so we refuse not to acknowledge,\namong the Papists of the present day, those vestiges of the Church which\nit has pleased the Lord should remain among them after its removal. When\nGod had once made his covenant with the Jews, it continued among them,\nrather because it was supported by its own stability in opposition to\ntheir impiety, than in consequence of their observance of it. Such,\ntherefore, was the certainty and constancy of the Divine goodness, the\ncovenant of the Lord remained among them; his faithfulness could not be\nobliterated by their perfidy; nor could circumcision be so profaned by\ntheir impure hands, but that it was always the true sign and sacrament\nof his covenant. Hence the children that were born to them, God calls\nhis own,[796] though they could not have belonged to him but by a\nspecial benediction. So after he had deposited his covenant in France,\nItaly, Germany, Spain, and England, when those countries were oppressed\nby the tyranny of Antichrist, still, in order that the covenant might\nremain inviolable, as a testimony of that covenant, he preserved baptism\namong them, which, being consecrated by his lips, retains its virtue in\nopposition to all the impiety of men. He also, by his providence, caused\nother vestiges of the Church to remain, that it might not be entirely\nlost. And as buildings are frequently demolished in such a manner as to\nleave the foundations and ruins remaining, so the Lord has not suffered\nAntichrist either to subvert his Church from the foundation, or to level\nit with the ground; though, to punish the ingratitude of men who\ndespised his word, he has permitted a dreadful concussion and\ndilapidation to be made; yet, amidst this devastation, he has been\npleased to preserve the edifice from being entirely destroyed.\nXII. While we refuse, therefore, to allow to the Papists the title of\nthe Church, without any qualification or restriction, we do not deny\nthat there are Churches among them. We only contend for the true and\nlegitimate constitution of the Church, which requires not only a\ncommunion in the sacraments, which are the signs of a Christian\nprofession, but above all, an agreement in doctrine. Daniel and Paul had\npredicted that Antichrist would sit in the temple of God.[797] The head\nof that cursed and abominable kingdom, in the Western Church, we affirm\nto be the Pope. When his seat is placed in the temple of God, it\nsuggests, that his kingdom will be such, that he will not abolish the\nname of Christ, or the Church. Hence it appears, that we by no means\ndeny that Churches may exist, even under his tyranny; but he has\nprofaned them by sacrilegious impiety, afflicted them by cruel\ndespotism, corrupted and almost terminated their existence by false and\npernicious doctrines, like poisonous potions; in such Churches, Christ\nlies half buried, the gospel is suppressed, piety exterminated, and the\nworship of God almost abolished; in a word, they are altogether in such\na state of confusion, that they exhibit a picture of Babylon, rather\nthan of the holy city of God. To conclude, I affirm that they are\nChurches, inasmuch as God has wonderfully preserved among them a remnant\nof his people, though miserably dispersed and dejected, and as there\nstill remain some marks of the Church, especially those, the efficacy of\nwhich neither the craft of the devil nor the malice of men can ever\ndestroy. But, on the other hand, because those marks, which we ought\nchiefly to regard in this controversy, are obliterated, I affirm, that\nthe form of the legitimate Church is not to be found either in any one\nof their congregations, or in the body at large.\nFootnote 781:\nEphes. ii. 20.\nFootnote 782:\n1 Tim. iii. 15.\nFootnote 783:\nJer. vii. 4.\nFootnote 784:\nGal. iv.\nFootnote 785:\nRom. ix. 6-8.\nFootnote 786:\nMal. ii. 1-9.\nFootnote 787:\nJohn xviii. 37.\nFootnote 788:\nJohn x. 4, 5, 14, 27.\nFootnote 789:\nEphes. ii. 20.\nFootnote 790:\nJohn viii. 47.\nFootnote 791:\nEphes. iv. 5.\nFootnote 792:\nPhil. ii. 2, 5.\nFootnote 793:\nJohn xvi. 2.\nFootnote 794:\nIsaiah i. 13, 14.\nFootnote 795:\nMatt. xviii. 18.\nFootnote 796:\nEzek. xiv. 20.\nFootnote 797:\nDan. ix. 27. 2 Thess. ii. 3, 4."

          "title": "CHAPTER III.",
          "content": "THE TEACHERS AND MINISTERS OF THE CHURCH; THEIR ELECTION AND OFFICE.\nWe must now treat of the order which it has been the Lord’s will to\nappoint for the government of his Church. For although he alone ought to\nrule and reign in the Church, and to have all preëminence in it, and\nthis government ought to be exercised and administered solely by his\nword,—yet, as he dwells not among us by a visible presence, so as to\nmake an audible declaration of his will to us, we have stated, that for\nthis purpose he uses the ministry of men whom he employs as his\ndelegates, not to transfer his right and honour to them, but only that\nhe may himself do his work by their lips; just as an artificer makes use\nof an instrument in the performance of his work. Some observations which\nI have made already, are necessary to be repeated here. It is true that\nhe might do this either by himself, without any means or instruments, or\neven by angels; but there are many reasons why he prefers making use of\nmen. For, in the first place, by this method he declares his kindness\ntowards us, since he chooses from among men those who are to be his\nambassadors to the world, to be the interpreters of his secret will, and\neven to act as his personal representatives. And thus he affords an\nactual proof, that when he so frequently calls us his temples, it is not\nan unmeaning appellation, since he gives answers to men, even from the\nmouths of men, as from a sanctuary. In the second place, this is a most\nexcellent and beneficial method to train us to humility, since he\naccustoms us to obey his word, though it is preached to us by men like\nourselves, and sometimes even of inferior rank. If he were himself to\nspeak from heaven, there would be no wonder if his sacred oracles were\ninstantly received with reverence, by the ears and hearts of all\nmankind. For who would not be awed by his present power? who would not\nfall prostrate at the first view of infinite Majesty? who would not be\nconfounded by that overpowering splendour? But when a contemptible\nmortal, who had just emerged from the dust, addresses us in the name of\nGod, we give the best evidence of our piety and reverence towards God\nhimself, if we readily submit to be instructed by his minister, who\npossesses no personal superiority to ourselves. For this reason, also,\nhe has deposited the treasure of his heavenly wisdom in frail and\nearthen vessels,[798] in order to afford a better proof of the\nestimation in which we hold it. Besides, nothing was more adapted to\npromote brotherly love, than a mutual connection of men by this bond,\nwhile one is constituted the pastor to teach all the rest, and they who\nare commanded to be disciples, receive one common doctrine from the same\nmouth. For if each person were sufficient for himself, and had no need\nof the assistance of another, such is the pride of human nature, every\none would despise others, and would also be despised by them. The Lord,\ntherefore, has connected his Church together, by that which he foresaw\nwould be the strongest bond for the preservation of their union, when he\ncommitted the doctrine of eternal life and salvation to men, that by\ntheir hands it might be communicated to others. Paul had this in view\nwhen he wrote to the Ephesians, “There is one body, and one Spirit, even\nas ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one\nbaptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,\nand in you all. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the\nmeasure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up\non high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that he\nascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower\nparts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up\nfar above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) And he gave some,\napostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors\nand teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the\nministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come in\nthe unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a\nperfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ;\nthat we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried\nabout with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning\ncraftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but, speaking the truth\nin love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even\nChrist; from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by\nthat which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in\nthe measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying\nof itself in love.”[799]\nII. In this passage he shows that the ministry of men, which God employs\nin his government of the Church, is the principal bond which holds\nbelievers together in one body. He also indicates that the Church cannot\nbe preserved in perfect safety, unless it be supported by these means\nwhich God has been pleased to appoint for its preservation. Christ, he\nsays, “ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all\nthings.”[800] And this is the way in which he does it. By means of his\nministers, to whom he has committed this office, and on whom he has\nbestowed grace to discharge it, he dispenses and distributes his gifts\nto the Church, and even affords some manifestation of his own presence,\nby exerting the power of his Spirit in this his institution, that it may\nnot be vain or ineffectual. Thus is the restoration of the saints\neffected; thus is the body of Christ edified; thus we grow up unto him\nwho is our Head in all things, and are united with each other; thus we\nare all brought to the unity of Christ; if prophecy flourishes among us,\nif we receive the apostles, if we despise not the doctrine which is\ndelivered to us. Whoever, therefore, either aims to abolish or\nundervalue this order, of which we are treating, and this species of\ngovernment, attempts to disorganize the Church, or rather to subvert and\ndestroy it altogether. For neither the light and heat of the sun, nor\nany meat and drink, are so necessary to the nourishment and sustenance\nof the present life, as the apostolical and pastoral office is to the\npreservation of the Church in the world.\nIII. Therefore I have already remarked, that God has frequently\ncommended its dignity to us by every possible encomium, in order that we\nmight hold it in the highest estimation and value, as more excellent\nthan every thing else. That he confers a peculiar favour upon men by\nraising up teachers for them, he fully signifies, when he commands the\nprophet to exclaim, “How beautiful are the feet of him that publisheth\npeace;”[801] and when he calls the apostles “the light of the world,”\nand “the salt of the earth.”[802] Nor could that office be more\nsplendidly distinguished than when he said to them, “He that heareth\nyou, heareth me.”[803] But there is no passage more remarkable than that\nin Paul’s Second Epistle to the Corinthians, where he professedly\ndiscusses this question. He contends, that there is nothing more\nexcellent or glorious than the ministry of the gospel in the Church,\ninasmuch as it is the ministration of the Spirit, and of righteousness,\nand of eternal life.[804] The tendency of these and similar passages, is\nto preserve that mode of governing the Church by its ministers, which\nthe Lord appointed to be of perpetual continuance, from sinking into\ndisesteem, and, at length, falling into disuse through mere contempt.\nAnd how exceedingly necessary it is, he has not only declared in words,\nbut shown by examples. When he was pleased to illuminate Cornelius more\nfully with the light of his truth, he despatched an angel from heaven to\nsend Peter to him. When he designs to call Paul to the knowledge of\nhimself, and to introduce him into the Church, he does not address him\nwith his own voice, but sends him to a man to receive the doctrine of\nsalvation, and the sanctification of baptism. If it was not without\nsufficient reason, that an angel, who is the messenger of God, refrains\nfrom announcing the Divine will himself, and directs a man to be sent\nfor in order to declare it,—and that Christ, the sole Teacher of\nbelievers, committed Paul to the instruction of a man, the same Paul\nwhom he had determined to elevate into the third heaven, and to favour\nwith a miraculous revelation of things unspeakable,—who can now dare to\ndespise that ministry, or to neglect it as unnecessary, the utility and\nnecessity of which God has been pleased to evince by such examples?\nIV. Those who preside over the government of the Church, according to\nthe institution of Christ, are named by Paul, first, “apostles;”\nsecondly, “prophets;” thirdly, “evangelists;” fourthly, “pastors;”\nlastly, “teachers.”[805] Of these, only the two last sustain an ordinary\noffice in the Church: the others were such as the Lord raised up at the\ncommencement of his kingdom, and such as he still raises up on\nparticular occasions, when required by the necessity of the times. The\nnature of the apostolic office is manifest from this command: “Go preach\nthe gospel to every creature.”[806] No certain limits are prescribed,\nbut the whole world is assigned to them, to be reduced to obedience to\nChrist; that by disseminating the gospel wherever they could, they might\nerect his kingdom in all nations. Therefore Paul, when he wished to\nprove his apostleship, declares, not merely that he had gained some one\ncity for Christ, but that he had propagated the gospel far and wide, and\nthat he had not built upon the foundation of others, but had planted\nChurches where the name of the Lord had never been heard before. The\n“apostles,” therefore, were missionaries, who were to reduce the world\nfrom their revolt to true obedience to God, and to establish his kingdom\nuniversally by the preaching of the gospel. Or, if you please, they were\nthe first architects of the Church, appointed to lay its foundations all\nover the world. Paul gives the appellation of “prophets,” not to all\ninterpreters of the Divine will, but only to those who were honoured\nwith some special revelation. Of these, either there are none in our\nday, or they are less conspicuous. By “evangelists,” I understand those\nwho were inferior to the apostles in dignity, but next to them in\noffice, and who performed similar functions. Such were Luke, Timothy,\nTitus, and others of that description; and perhaps also the seventy\ndisciples, whom Christ ordained to occupy the second station from the\napostles.[807] According to this interpretation, which appears to me\nperfectly consistent with the language and meaning of the apostle, those\nthree offices were not instituted to be of perpetual continuance in the\nChurch, but only for that age when Churches were to be raised where none\nhad existed before, or were at least to be conducted from Moses to\nChrist. Though I do not deny, that, even since that period, God has\nsometimes raised up apostles or evangelists in their stead, as he has\ndone in our own time. For there was a necessity for such persons to\nrecover the Church from the defection of Antichrist. Nevertheless, I\ncall this an extraordinary office, because it has no place in\nwell-constituted Churches. Next follow “pastors” and “teachers,” who are\nalways indispensable to the Church. The difference between them I\napprehend to be this—that teachers have no official concern with the\ndiscipline, or the administration of the sacraments, or with admonitions\nand exhortations, but only with the interpretation of the Scripture,\nthat pure and sound doctrine may be retained among believers; whereas\nthe pastoral office includes all these things.\nV. We have now ascertained what offices were appointed to continue for a\ntime in the government of the Church, and what were instituted to be of\nperpetual duration. If we connect the evangelists with the apostles, as\nsustaining the same office, we shall then have two offices of each\ndescription, corresponding to each other. For our pastors bear the same\nresemblance to the apostles, as our teachers do to the ancient prophets.\nThe office of the prophets was more excellent, on account of the special\ngift of revelation, by which they were distinguished; but the office of\nteachers is executed in a similar manner, and has precisely the same\nend. So those twelve individuals, whom the Lord chose to promulgate the\nfirst proclamation of his gospel to the world, preceded all others in\norder and dignity. For although, according to the meaning and etymology\nof the word, all the ministers of the Church may be called apostles,\nbecause they are all sent by the Lord, and are his messengers, yet, as\nit was of great importance to have a certain knowledge of the mission of\npersons who were to announce a thing new and unheard before, it was\nnecessary that those twelve, together with Paul, who was afterwards\nadded to their number, should be distinguished beyond all others by a\npeculiar title. Paul himself, indeed, gives this name to “Andronicus and\nJunia, who,” he says, “are of note among the apostles;”[808] but when he\nmeans to speak with strict propriety, he never applies that name except\nto those of the first order that we have mentioned. And this is the\ncommon usage of the Scripture. But the province of pastors is the same\nas that of the apostles, except that they preside over particular\nChurches respectively committed to each of them. Of the nature of their\nfunctions let us now proceed to a more distinct statement.\nVI. Our Lord, when he sent forth his apostles, commissioned them, as we\nhave just remarked, to preach the gospel, and to baptize all believers\nfor the remission of sins.[809] He had already commanded them to\ndistribute the sacred symbols of his body and blood according to his own\nexample.[810] Behold the sacred, inviolable, and perpetual law imposed\nupon those who call themselves successors of the apostles; it commands\nthem to preach the gospel, and to administer the sacraments. Hence we\nconclude, that those who neglect both these duties have no just\npretensions to the character of apostles. But what shall we say of\npastors? Paul speaks not only of himself, but of all who bear that\noffice, when he says, “Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers\nof Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.”[811] Again: “A bishop\nmust hold fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be\nable, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convince the\ngainsayers.”[812] From these and similar passages, which frequently\noccur, we may infer that the preaching of the gospel, and the\nadministration of the sacraments, constitute the two principal parts of\nthe pastoral office. Now, the business of teaching is not confined to\npublic discourses, but extends also to private admonitions. Thus Paul\ncalls upon the Ephesians to witness the truth of his declaration, “I\nhave kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed\nyou, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying\nboth to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and\nfaith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” And a little after: “I ceased not\nto warn every one, night and day, with tears.”[813] But it is no part of\nmy present design, to enumerate all the excellences of a good pastor,\nbut only to show what is implied in the profession of those who call\nthemselves pastors; namely, that they preside over the Church in that\nstation, not that they may enjoy a respectable sinecure, but to instruct\nthe people in true piety by the doctrine of Christ, to administer the\nholy mysteries, to maintain and exercise proper discipline. For the Lord\ndenounces to all those who have been stationed as watchmen in the\nChurch, that if any one perish in ignorance through their negligence, he\nwill require the blood of such a person at their hands.[814] What Paul\nsays of himself, belongs to them all: “Woe is unto me, if I preach not\nthe gospel,” because “a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto\nme.”[815] Lastly, what the apostles did for the whole world, that every\nindividual pastor ought to do for his flock to which he is appointed.\nVII. While we assign to them all respectively their distinct Churches,\nyet we do not deny that a pastor, who is connected with one Church, may\nassist others, either when any disputes arise, which may require his\npresence, or when his advice is asked upon any difficult subject. But\nbecause, in order to preserve the peace of the Church, there is a\nnecessity for such a regulation as shall clearly define to every one\nwhat duty he has to do, lest they should all fall into disorder, run\nhither and thither in uncertainty without any call, and all resort to\none place; and lest those who feel more solicitude for their personal\naccommodation than for the edification of the Church, should, without\nany cause but their own caprice, leave the Churches destitute,—this\ndistribution ought as far as possible to be generally observed, that\nevery one may be content with his own limits, and not invade the\nprovince of another. Nor is this an invention of men, but an institution\nof God himself. For we read that Paul and Barnabas “ordained elders in\nthe respective Churches of Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch;”[816] and Paul\nhimself directed Titus to “ordain elders in every city.”[817] So in\nother passages he mentions “the bishops at Philippi,”[818] and\nArchippus, the bishop of the Colossians.[819] And a remarkable speech of\nhis is preserved by Luke, addressed to “the elders of the Church of\nEphesus.”[820] Whoever, therefore, has undertaken the government and\ncharge of one Church, let him know that he is bound to this law of the\nDivine call; not that he is fixed to his station so as never to be\npermitted to leave it in a regular and orderly manner, if the public\nbenefit should require it; but he who has been called to one place,\nought never to think either of departing from his situation, or\nrelinquishing the office altogether, from any motive of personal\nconvenience or advantage. But if it be expedient that he should remove\nto another station, he ought not to attempt this on his own private\nopinion, but to be guided by public authority.\nVIII. In calling those who preside over Churches by the appellations of\nbishops, elders, pastors, and ministers, without any distinction, I have\nfollowed the usage of the Scripture, which applies all these terms to\nexpress the same meaning. For to all who discharge the ministry of the\nword, it gives the title of “bishops.” So when Paul enjoins Titus to\n“ordain elders in every city,” he immediately adds, “For a bishop must\nbe blameless.”[821] So in another Epistle he salutes more bishops than\none in one Church.[822] And in the Acts he is declared to have sent for\nthe elders of the Church of Ephesus, whom, in his address to them, he\ncalls “bishops.”[823] Here it must be observed, that we have enumerated\nonly those offices which consist in the ministry of the word; nor does\nPaul mention any other in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the\nEphesians, which we have quoted. But in the Epistle to the Romans, and\nthe First Epistle to the Corinthians, he enumerates others, as “powers,”\n“gifts of healing,” “interpretation of tongues,” “governments,” “care of\nthe poor.”[824] Those functions which were merely temporary, I omit, as\nforeign to our present subject. But there are two which perpetually\nremain—“government,” and “the care of the poor.” “Governors” I apprehend\nto have been persons of advanced years, selected from the people, to\nunite with the bishops in giving admonitions and exercising discipline.\nFor no other interpretation can be given of that injunction, “He that\nruleth, let him do it with diligence.”[825] Therefore, from the\nbeginning, every Church has had its senate or council, composed of\npious, grave, and holy men, who were invested with that jurisdiction in\nthe correction of vices, of which we shall soon treat. Now, that this\nregulation was not of a single age, experience itself demonstrates. This\noffice of government is necessary, therefore, in every age.\nIX. The care of the poor was committed to the “deacons.” The Epistle to\nthe Romans, however, mentions two functions of this kind. “He that\ngiveth,” says the apostle, “let him do it with simplicity: he that\nshoweth mercy, with cheerfulness.”[826] Now, as it is certain that he\nthere speaks of the public offices of the Church, it follows that there\nwere two distinct orders of deacons. Unless my judgment deceive me, the\nformer clause refers to the deacons who administered the alms; and the\nother to those who devoted themselves to the care of poor and sick\npersons; such as the widows mentioned by Paul to Timothy.[827] For women\ncould execute no other public office, than by devoting themselves to the\nservice of the poor. If we admit this,—and it ought to be fully\nadmitted,—there will be two classes of deacons, of whom one will serve\nthe Church in dispensing the property given to the poor, the other in\ntaking care of the poor themselves.—Though the word itself (διακονια) is\nof more extensive signification, yet the Scripture particularly gives\nthe title of “deacons” to those whom the Church has appointed to\ndispense the alms and take care of the poor, and constituted stewards,\nas it were, of the common treasury of the poor; and whose origin,\ninstitution, and office, are described in the Acts of the Apostles. For\n“when there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews\nbecause their widows were neglected in the daily ministration,”[828] the\napostles pleaded their inability to discharge both offices, of the\nministry of the word and the service of tables, and said to the\nmultitude, “Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of\nhonest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint\nover this business.” See what were the characters of the deacons in the\napostolic Church, and what ought to be the characters of ours, in\nconformity to the primitive example.\nX. Now, as “all things” in the Church are required to “be done decently\nand in order,”[829] there is nothing in which this ought to be more\ndiligently observed, than the constitution of its government; because\nthere would be more danger from disorder in this case than in any other.\nTherefore, that restless and turbulent persons may not presumptuously\nintrude themselves into the office of teaching or of governing, it is\nexpressly provided, that no one shall assume a public office in the\nChurch without a call. In order, therefore, that any one may be\naccounted a true minister of the Church, it is necessary, in the first\nplace, that he be regularly called to it, and, in the second place, that\nhe answer his call; that is, by undertaking and executing the office\nassigned to him. This may frequently be observed in Paul; who, when he\nwishes to prove his apostleship, almost always alleges his call,\ntogether with his fidelity in the execution of the office. If so eminent\na minister of Christ dare not arrogate to himself an authority to\nrequire his being heard in the Church, but in consequence of his\nappointment to it by a Divine commission, and his faithful discharge of\nthe duty assigned him,—what extreme impudence must it be, if any man,\ndestitute of both these characters, should claim such an honour for\nhimself! But having already spoken of the necessity of discharging the\noffice, let us now confine ourselves to the call.\nXI. Now, the discussion of this subject includes four branches: what are\nthe qualifications of ministers; in what manner they are to be chosen;\nby whom they ought to be appointed; and with what rite or ceremony they\nare to be introduced into their office. I speak of the external and\nsolemn call, which belongs to the public order of the Church; passing\nover that secret call, of which every minister is conscious to himself\nbefore God, but which is not known to the Church. This secret call,\nhowever, is the honest testimony of our heart, that we accept the office\noffered to us, not from ambition or avarice, or any other unlawful\nmotive, but from a sincere fear of God, and an ardent zeal for the\nedification of the Church. This, as I have hinted, is indispensable to\nevery one of us, if we would approve our ministry in the sight of God.\nIn the view of the Church, however, he who enters on his office with an\nevil conscience, is nevertheless duly called, provided his iniquity be\nnot discovered. It is even common to speak of private persons as called\nto the ministry, who appear to be adapted and qualified for the\ndischarge of its duties; because learning, connected with piety and\nother endowments of a good pastor, constitutes a kind of preparation for\nit. For those whom the Lord has destined to so important an office, he\nfirst furnishes with those talents which are requisite to its execution,\nthat they may not enter upon it empty and unprepared. Hence Paul, in his\nEpistle to the Corinthians, when he intended to treat of the offices\nthemselves, first enumerated the gifts which ought to be possessed by\nthe persons who sustain those offices.[830] But as this is the first of\nthe four points which I have proposed, let us now proceed to it.\nXII. The qualifications of those who ought to be chosen bishops, are\nstated at large by Paul in two passages.[831] The sum of all he says is,\nthat none are to be chosen but men of sound doctrine and a holy life,\nnot chargeable with any fault that may destroy their authority, or\ndisgrace their ministry. The same rule is laid down for the deacons and\ngovernors. Constant care is required, that they be not unequal to the\nburden imposed upon them, or, in other words, that they be endowed with\nthose talents which are necessary to the discharge of their duty. So,\nwhen Christ was about to send forth his apostles, he furnished them with\nsuch means and powers as were indispensable to their success.[832] And\nPaul, after having delineated the character of a good and genuine\nbishop, admonishes Timothy not to contaminate himself by the appointment\nof any one of a different description.[833] The question relating to the\n_manner_ in which they are to be chosen, I refer not to the form of\nelection, but to the religious awe which ought to be observed in it.\nHence the fasting and prayer, which Luke states to have been practised\nby the faithful at the ordination of elders.[834] For knowing themselves\nto be engaged in a business of the highest importance, they dared not\nattempt any thing but with the greatest reverence and solicitude. And\nabove all things, they were earnest in prayers and supplications to God\nfor the spirit of wisdom and discretion.\nXIII. The third inquiry we proposed was, by whom ministers are to be\nchosen. Now, for this no certain rule can be gathered from the\nappointment of the apostles, which was a case somewhat different from\nthe common call of other ministers. For as theirs was an extraordinary\noffice, it was necessary, in order to render it conspicuous by some\neminent character, that they who were to sustain it should be called and\nappointed by the mouth of the Lord himself. The apostles, therefore,\nentered upon their work, not in consequence of any human election, but\nempowered by the sole command of God and of Christ. Hence, when they\nwish to substitute another in the place of Judas, they refrain from a\ncertain appointment of any one, but nominate two, that the Lord may\ndeclare by lot which of them he wills to be his successor.[835] In the\nsame sense must be understood the declaration of Paul, that he had been\ncreated “an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ,\nand God the Father.”[836] The first clause, _not of men_, was applicable\nto him in common with all pious ministers of the word; for no man can\nlawfully exercise this ministry without having been called by God. The\nother clause was special and peculiar to himself. When he glories in\nthis, therefore, he not only claims what belongs to a true and lawful\npastor, but likewise brings forward an evidence of his apostleship. For\nwhereas there were, among the Galatians, some who, from an eagerness to\ndiminish his authority, represented him as a common disciple deputed by\nthe primary apostles,—in order to vindicate the dignity of his\npreaching, against which he knew these artifices were directed, he found\nit necessary to show that he was not inferior to the other apostles in\nany respect. Wherefore he affirms, that he had not been elected by the\njudgment of men, like some ordinary bishop, but by the mouth and clear\nrevelation of the Lord himself.\nXIV. But that the election and appointment of bishops by men is\nnecessary to constitute a legitimate call to the office, no sober person\nwill deny, while there are so many testimonies of Scripture to establish\nit. Nor is it contradicted by that declaration of Paul, that he was “an\napostle, not of men, nor by man,”[837] since he is not speaking in that\npassage of the ordinary election of ministers, but claiming to himself\nwhat was the special privilege of the apostles. The immediate\ndesignation of Paul, by the Lord himself, to this peculiar privilege,\nwas nevertheless accompanied with the form of an ecclesiastical call,\nfor Luke states, that “As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the\nHoly Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I\nhave called them.”[838] What end could be answered by this separation\nand imposition of hands after the Holy Spirit had testified their\nelection, unless it was the preservation of the order of the Church in\ndesignating ministers by men? God could not sanction that order,\ntherefore, by a more illustrious example than when, after having\ndeclared that he had constituted Paul the apostle of the Gentiles, he\nnevertheless directed him to be designated by the Church. The same may\nbe observed in the election of Matthias.[839] For the apostolic office\nbeing of such high importance that they could not venture to fill up\ntheir number by the choice of any one person from their own judgment,\nthey appointed two, one of whom was to be chosen by lot; that so the\nelection might obtain a positive sanction from Heaven, and yet that the\norder of the Church might not be altogether neglected.\nXV. Here it is inquired, whether a minister ought to be chosen by the\nwhole Church, or only by the other ministers and the elders who preside\nover the discipline, or whether he may be appointed by the authority of\nan individual. Those who attribute this right to any one man, quote what\nPaul says to Titus: “For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou\nshouldst ordain elders in every city;”[840] and to Timothy: “Lay hands\nsuddenly on no man.”[841] But they are exceedingly mistaken, if they\nsuppose that either Timothy at Ephesus, or Titus in Crete, exercised a\nsovereign power to regulate every thing according to his own pleasure.\nFor they presided over the people, only to lead them by good and\nsalutary counsels, not to act alone to the exclusion of all others. But\nthat this may not be thought to be an invention of mine, I will prove it\nby a similar example. For Luke relates, that elders were ordained in the\nChurches by Paul and Barnabas, but at the same time he distinctly marks\nthe manner in which this was done,—namely, by the suffrages or votes of\nthe people; for this is the meaning of the term he there\nemploys—χειροτονησαντες πρεσβυτερους κατ᾽ ἐκκλησιαν.[842] Those two\napostles, therefore, ordained them; but the whole multitude, according\nto the custom observed in elections among the Greeks, declared by the\nelevation of their hands who was the object of their choice. So the\nRoman historians frequently speak of the consul, who held the\nassemblies, as _appointing_ the new magistrates, for no other reason but\nbecause he received the suffrages and presided at the election. Surely\nit is not credible that Paul granted to Timothy and Titus more power\nthan he assumed to himself; but we see that he was accustomed to ordain\nbishops according to the suffrages of the people. The above passages,\ntherefore, ought to be understood in the same manner, to guard against\nall infringement of the common right and liberty of the Church. It is a\ngood remark, therefore, of Cyprian, when he contends, “that it proceeds\nfrom Divine authority, that a priest should be elected publicly in the\npresence of all the people, and that he should be approved as a worthy\nand fit person by the public judgment and testimony.” In the case of the\nLevitical priests, we find it was commanded by the Lord, that they\nshould be brought forward in the view of the people before their\nconsecration. Nor was Matthias added to the number of the apostles, nor\nwere the seven deacons appointed, without the presence and approbation\nof the people.—“These examples,” says Cyprian, “show that the ordination\nof a priest ought not to be performed but with the knowledge and\nconcurrence of the people, in order that the election which shall have\nbeen examined by the testimony of all, may be just and legitimate.” We\nfind, therefore, that it is a legitimate ministry according to the word\nof God, when those who appear suitable persons are appointed with the\nconsent and approbation of the people; but that other pastors ought to\npreside over the election, to guard the multitude from falling into any\nimproprieties, through inconstancy, intrigue, or confusion.\nXVI. There remains the Form of ordination, which is the last point that\nwe have mentioned relative to the call of ministers. Now, it appears\nthat when the apostles introduced any one into the ministry, they used\nno other ceremony than imposition of hands. This rite, I believe,\ndescended from the custom of the Hebrews, who, when they wished to bless\nand consecrate any thing, presented it to God by imposition of hands.\nThus, when Jacob blessed Ephraim and Manasseh, he laid his hands upon\ntheir heads.[843] This custom was followed by our Lord, when he prayed\nover infants.[844] It was with the same design, I apprehend, that the\nJews were directed in the law to lay their hands upon their sacrifices.\nWherefore the imposition of the hands of the apostles was an indication\nthat they offered to God the person whom they introduced into the\nministry. They used the same ceremony over those on whom they conferred\nthe visible gifts of the Spirit. But, be that as it may, this was the\nsolemn rite invariably practised, whenever any one was called to the\nministry of the Church. Thus they ordained pastors and teachers, and\nthus they ordained deacons. Now, though there is no express precept for\nthe imposition of hands, yet since we find it to have been constantly\nused by the apostles, such a punctual observance of it by them ought to\nhave the force of a precept with us. And certainly this ceremony is\nhighly useful both to recommend to the people the dignity of the\nministry, and to admonish the person ordained that he is no longer his\nown master, but devoted to the service of God and the Church. Besides,\nit will not be an unmeaning sign, if it be restored to its true origin.\nFor if the Spirit of God institutes nothing in the Church in vain, we\nshall perceive that this ceremony, which proceeded from him, is not\nwithout its use, provided it be not perverted by a superstitious abuse.\nFinally, it is to be remarked, that the imposition of hands on the\nministers was not the act of the whole multitude, but was confined to\nthe pastors. It is not certain whether this ceremony was, in all cases,\nperformed by more pastors than one, or whether it was ever the act of a\nsingle pastor. The former appears to have been the fact in the case of\nthe seven deacons, of Paul and Barnabas, and some few others.[845] But\nPaul speaks of himself as having laid hands upon Timothy, without any\nmention of many others having united with him. “I put thee in\nremembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the\nputting on of my hands.”[846] His expression, in the other Epistle, of\n“the laying on of the hands of the presbytery,”[847] I apprehend not to\nsignify a company of elders, but to denote the ordination itself; as if\nhe had said, Take care that the grace which thou receivedst by the\nlaying on of hands, when I ordained thee a presbyter, be not in vain.\nFootnote 798:\n2 Cor. iv. 7.\nFootnote 799:\nEph. iv. 4-16.\nFootnote 800:\nEph. iv. 10.\nFootnote 801:\nIsaiah lii. 7.\nFootnote 802:\nMatt. v. 13, 14.\nFootnote 803:\nLuke x. 16.\nFootnote 804:\n2 Cor. iii. 6, &c.\nFootnote 805:\nEph. iv. 11.\nFootnote 806:\nMark xvi. 15.\nFootnote 807:\nLuke x. 1.\nFootnote 808:\nRom. xvi. 7.\nFootnote 809:\nMatt. xxviii. 19.\nFootnote 810:\nLuke xxii. 19.\nFootnote 811:\n1 Cor. iv. 1.\nFootnote 812:\nTitus i. 7, 9.\nFootnote 813:\nActs xx. 20, 21, 31.\nFootnote 814:\nEzek. iii. 17, 18.\nFootnote 815:\n1 Cor. ix. 16, 17.\nFootnote 816:\nActs xiv. 21, 23.\nFootnote 817:\nTitus i. 5.\nFootnote 818:\nPhil. i. 1.\nFootnote 819:\nCol. iv. 17.\nFootnote 820:\nActs xx. 17, &c.\nFootnote 821:\nTitus i. 5, 7.\nFootnote 822:\nPhil. i. 1.\nFootnote 823:\nActs xx. 17, 28, ἐπισκοπους.\nFootnote 824:\n1 Cor. xii. 28, δυναμεις, χαρισματα ιαματων, γενη γλωσσων,\nκυβερνησεις.\nFootnote 825:\nRom. xii. 8.\nFootnote 826:\nRom. xii. 8, μεταδιδους, εν ἁπλοτητι, ὁ ελεων, εν ἱλαροτητι.\nFootnote 827:\n1 Tim. v. 9, 10.\nFootnote 828:\nActs vi. 1-3.\nFootnote 829:\n1 Cor. xiv. 40.\nFootnote 830:\n1 Cor. xii. 7, &c.\nFootnote 831:\n1 Tim. iii. 1, &c.

          "title": "CHAPTER IV.",
          "content": "THE STATE OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH, AND THE MODE OF GOVERNMENT PRACTISED\nBEFORE THE PAPACY.\nHitherto we have treated of the mode of government in the Church, as it\nhas been delivered to us by the pure word of God, and of the offices in\nit, as they were instituted by Christ. Now, that all these things may be\nmore clearly and familiarly displayed, and more deeply impressed upon\nour minds, it will be useful to examine what was the form of the ancient\nChurch, in these particulars. It will place before our eyes an actual\nexemplification of the Divine institution. For though the bishops of\nthose times published many canons, in which they seemed to express more\nthan had been expressed in the Holy Scriptures, yet they were so\ncautious in framing their whole economy according to the sole standard\nof the word of God, that in this respect scarcely any thing can be\ndetected among them inconsistent with that word. But though there might\nbe something to be regretted in their regulations, yet because they\ndirected their sincere and zealous efforts to preserve the institution\nof God, without deviating from it to any considerable extent, it will be\nhighly useful in this place to give a brief sketch of what their\npractice was. As we have stated that there are three kinds of ministers\nrecommended to us in the Scripture, so the ancient Church divided all\nthe ministers it had into three orders. For from the order of\npresbyters, they chose some for pastors and teachers; the others\npresided over the discipline and corrections. To the deacons was\ncommitted the care of the poor and the distribution of the alms.\n_Readers_ and _Acolytes_ were not names of certain offices, but young\nmen, to whom they also gave the name of _clergy_, whom they accustomed\nfrom their youth to certain exercises in the service of the Church, that\nthey might better understand to what they were destined, and might enter\nupon their office better prepared for it in due time; as I shall soon\nshow more at large. Therefore Jerome, after having mentioned five orders\nof the Church, enumerates bishops, presbyters, deacons, the faithful, or\nbelievers at large, and catechumens, or persons who had not yet been\nbaptized, but had applied for instruction in the Christian faith. Thus\nhe assigns no particular place to the rest of the clergy and the monks.\nII. All those to whom the office of teaching was assigned, were\ndenominated presbyters. To guard against dissension, the general\nconsequence of equality, the presbyters in each city chose one of their\nown number, whom they distinguished by the title of _bishop_. The\nbishop, however, was not so superior to the rest in honour and dignity,\nas to have any dominion over his colleagues; but the functions performed\nby a consul in the senate, such as, to propose things for consideration,\nto collect the votes, to preside over the rest in the exercise of\nadvice, admonition, and exhortation, to regulate all the proceedings by\nhis authority, and to carry into execution whatever had been decreed by\nthe general voice;—such were the functions exercised by the bishop in\nthe assembly of the presbyters. And that this arrangement was introduced\nby human agreement, on account of the necessity of the times, is\nacknowledged by the ancient writers themselves. Thus Jerome, on the\nEpistle to Titus, says, “A presbyter is the same as a bishop. And before\ndissensions in religion were produced by the instigation of the devil,\nand one said, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Cephas, the Churches\nwere governed by a common council of presbyters. Afterwards, in order to\ndestroy the seeds of dissensions, the whole charge was committed to one.\nTherefore, as the presbyters know that according to the custom of the\nChurch they are subject to the bishop who presides over them, so let the\nbishops know that their superiority to the presbyters is more from\ncustom than from the appointment of the Lord, and they ought to unite\ntogether in the government of the Church.” In another place, he shows\nthe antiquity of this institution; for he says, that at Alexandria, even\nfrom Mark the Evangelist to Heraclas and Dionysius, the presbyters\nalways chose one of their body to preside over them, whom they called\ntheir bishop. Every city, therefore, had its college of presbyters, who\nwere pastors and teachers. For they all executed the duties of teaching,\nexhorting, and correcting, among the people, as Paul enjoins bishops to\ndo;[848] and in order to leave successors behind them, they laboured in\ntraining young men, who had enlisted themselves in the sacred warfare.\nTo every city was assigned a certain district, which received presbyters\nfrom it, and was reckoned as a part of that Church. Every assembly, as I\nhave stated, for the sole purpose of preserving order and peace, was\nunder the direction of one bishop, who, while he had the precedence of\nall others in dignity, was himself subject to the assembly of the\nbrethren. If the territory placed under his episcopate was too extensive\nto admit of his discharging all the duties of a bishop in every part of\nit, presbyters were appointed in certain stations, to act as his\ndeputies in things of minor importance. These were called\n_chorepiscopi_, or _country bishops_, because in the country they\nrepresented the bishop.\nIII. But with respect to the office of which we are now treating, the\nbishops and presbyters were equally required to employ themselves in the\ndispensation of the word and sacraments. For at Alexandria only, because\nArius had disturbed the Church there, it was ordained that no presbyter\nshould preach to the people; as is asserted by Socrates in the ninth\nbook of his Tripartite History, with which Jerome hesitates not to\nexpress his dissatisfaction. It would certainly have been regarded as a\nprodigy, if any man had claimed the character of a bishop, who had not\nshown himself really such in his conduct. Such was the strictness of\nthose times, that all ministers were constrained to discharge the duties\nwhich the Lord requires of them. I refer not to the custom of one age\nonly; for even in the time of Gregory, when the Church was almost\nextinct, or at least had considerably degenerated from its ancient\npurity, it would not have been permitted for any bishop to abstain from\npreaching. Gregory somewhere says, “A priest dies, if his sound be not\nheard;[849] for he provokes the wrath of the invisible Judge against\nhim, if he go without the sound of preaching.” And in another place:\n“When Paul declares that he is ‘pure from the blood of all,’[850] by\nthis declaration, we, who are called priests, are convicted, confounded,\nand declared to be guilty, who to all our own crimes add the deaths of\nothers; for we are chargeable with slaying all those whom we daily\nbehold advancing to death, while we are indifferent and silent.” He\ncalls himself and others silent, because they were less assiduous in\ntheir work than they ought to be. Since he spares not those who\nperformed half of their duty, what is it probable he would have done, if\nany one had neglected it altogether? It was therefore long maintained in\nthe Church, that the principal office of a bishop was to feed the people\nwith the word of God, or to edify the Church both in public and private\nwith sound doctrine.\nIV. The establishment of one archbishop over all the bishops of each\nprovince, and the appointment of patriarchs at the Council of Nice, with\nrank and dignity superior to the archbishops, were regulations for the\npreservation of discipline. In this disquisition, however, what was of\nthe least frequent use cannot be wholly omitted. The principal reason,\ntherefore, for the institution of these orders was, that if any thing\nshould take place in any Church which could not be settled by a few\npersons, it might be referred to a provincial synod. If the magnitude or\ndifficulty of the case required a further discussion, the patriarchs\nwere called to unite with the synods; and from them there could be no\nappeal but to a general council. This constitution of government some\ncalled a _hierarchy_—a name, in my opinion, improper, and certainly not\nused in the Scriptures. For it has been the design of the Holy Spirit,\nin every thing relating to the government of the Church, to guard\nagainst any dreams of principality or dominion. But if we look at the\n_thing_, without regarding the _term_, we shall find that the ancient\nbishops had no intention of contriving a form of government for the\nChurch, different from that which God has prescribed in his word.\nV. Nor was the situation of deacons at that time at all different from\nwhat it had been under the apostles. For they received the daily\ncontributions of believers and the annual revenues of the Church, to\napply them to their proper uses, that is, to distribute part to the\nministers, and part for the support of the poor; subject, however, to\nthe authority of the bishop, to whom they also rendered an account of\ntheir administration every year. For when the canons invariably\nrepresent the bishop as the dispenser of all the benefactions of the\nChurch, it is not to be understood as if he executed that charge\nhimself, but because it belonged to him to give directions to the\ndeacon, who were to be entirely supported from the funds of the Church,\nto whom the remainder was to be distributed, and in what proportion to\neach person; and because he had the superintendence over the deacon, to\nexamine whether he faithfully discharged his office. Thus the canons,\nascribed to the apostles, contain the following injunction: “We ordain\nthat the bishop do have the property of the Church in his own power. For\nif the souls of men, which are of superior value, have been intrusted to\nhim, there is far greater propriety in his taking charge of the\npecuniary concerns; so that all things may be distributed to the poor by\nhis authority through the presbyters and deacons, and that they may be\nadministered with reverence, and all concern.” And in the Council of\nAntioch it was decreed, that those bishops should be censured who\nmanaged the pecuniary concerns of the Church without the concurrence of\nthe presbyters and deacons. But it is unnecessary to argue this point\nany further, since it is evident from many epistles of Gregory, that\neven in his time, when the administration of the Church was in other\nrespects become very corrupt, yet this custom was still retained, that\nthe deacons were the stewards for the relief of the poor, under the\nauthority of the bishop. It is probable that subdeacons were at first\nattached to the deacons, to assist them in transacting the business of\nthe poor; but this distinction was soon lost. Archdeacons were first\nerected when the extent of the property required a new and more accurate\nmode of administration; though Jerome states that there were such\noffices even in his time. In their hands was placed the amount of the\nannual revenues, of the possessions, and of the household furniture, and\nthe management of the daily contributions. Whence Gregory denounces to\nthe archdeacon of Thessalonica, that he would be held guilty, if any of\nthe property of the Church should be lost by him, either through\nnegligence or fraud. Their appointment to read the gospel, and to exhort\nthe people to pray, and their admission to the administration of the cup\nin the sacred supper, were intended to dignify their office, that they\nmight discharge it with the more piety, in consequence of being\nadmonished by such ceremonies, that they were not executing some profane\nstewardship, but that their function was spiritual and dedicated to God.\nVI. Hence it is easy to judge what use was made of the property of the\nChurch, and in what manner it was dispensed. We often find it stated,\nboth in the decrees of the councils, and by the ancient writers, that\nwhatever the Church possessed, whether in lands or in money, was the\npatrimony of the poor. The bishops and deacons, therefore, are\ncontinually reminded that they are not managing their own treasures, but\nthose destined to supply the necessity of the poor, which if they\nunfaithfully withhold or embezzle, they will be guilty of murder. Hence\nthey are admonished to distribute this property to the parties entitled\nto it, with the greatest caution and reverence, as in the sight of God,\nand without respect of persons. Hence also the solemn protestations of\nChrysostom, Ambrose, Augustine, and other bishops, assuring the people\nof their integrity. Now, since it is perfectly equitable, and sanctioned\nby the law of the Lord, that those who are employed in the service of\nthe Church should be maintained at the public expense of the Church,—and\neven in that age some presbyters consecrated their patrimonies to God,\nand reduced themselves to voluntary poverty,—the distribution was such,\nthat neither were the ministers left without support, nor were the poor\nneglected. Yet, at the same time, care was taken that the ministers\nthemselves, who ought to set an example of frugality to others, should\nnot have enough to be abused to the purposes of splendour or delicacy,\nbut only what would suffice to supply their necessities. “For,” says\nJerome, “those of the clergy who are able to maintain themselves from\ntheir own patrimony, if they take what belongs to the poor, are guilty\nof sacrilege, and by such an abuse, they eat and drink judgment to\nthemselves.”\nVII. At first the administration was free and voluntary, the bishops and\ndeacons acting with spontaneous fidelity, and integrity of conscience\nand innocence of life supplying the place of laws. Afterwards, when the\ncupidity or corrupt dispositions of some gave birth to evil examples, in\norder to correct these abuses, canons were made, which divided the\nrevenues of the Church into four parts, assigning the first to the\nclergy, the second to the poor, the third to the reparation of Churches\nand other buildings, the fourth to poor strangers. For, though other\ncanons assign this last part to the bishop, this forms no variation from\nthe division which I have mentioned. For the intention was, that it\nshould be appropriated to him, neither for his own exclusive\nconsumption, nor for lavish or arbitrary distribution, but to enable him\nto support the hospitality which Paul requires of persons in that\noffice.[851] And so it is explained by Gelasius and Gregory. For\nGelasius adduces no other reason why the bishop should claim any thing\nfor himself, than to enable him to communicate to captives and\nstrangers. And Gregory is still more explicit. He says, “It is the\ncustom of the apostolic see, at the ordination of a bishop, to command\nhim that all the revenue received by him be divided into four portions;\nnamely, one for the bishop and his family, for the support of\nhospitality and entertainment; the second for the clergy; the third for\nthe poor; the fourth for the reparation of Churches.” It was unlawful\nfor the bishop, therefore, to take for his own use any thing more than\nwas sufficient for moderate and frugal sustenance and clothing. If any\none began to transgress the due limits, either in luxury, or in\nostentation and pomp, he was immediately admonished by his colleagues;\nand if he would not comply with the admonition, he was deposed from his\noffice.\nVIII. The portion which they applied to ornament the sacred edifices, at\nfirst was very small; and even after the Church was become a little more\nwealthy, they did not exceed moderation in this respect: whatever money\nwas so employed, still continued to be held in reserve for the poor, if\nany pressing necessity should occur. Thus, when famine prevailed in the\nprovince of Jerusalem, and there was no other way of relieving their\nwants, Cyril sold the vessels and vestments, and expended the produce in\npurchasing sustenance for the poor. In like manner, when vast numbers of\nthe Persians were almost perishing with hunger, Acatius, bishop of\nAmida, after having convoked his clergy, and made that celebrated\nspeech, “Our God has no need of dishes or cups, because he neither eats\nnor drinks,” melted down the vessels, and converted them into money, to\nredeem the wretched, and buy food for them. Jerome also, while he\ninveighs against the excessive splendour of the temples, makes\nhonourable mention of Exuperius, at that time bishop of Thoulouse, who\nadministered the emblem of our Lord’s body in a wicker basket, and the\nemblem of his blood in a glass, but suffered no poor person to endure\nhunger. The same that I have just said of Acatius, Ambrose relates of\nhimself; for when he was censured by the Arians for having broken up the\nsacred vessels to pay the ransom of some captives, he made the following\nmost excellent defence: “He who sent forth the apostles without gold,\ngathered Churches together likewise without gold. The Church has gold,\nnot to keep, but to expend, and to furnish relief in necessities. What\nneed is there to keep that which is of no service? Do not we know how\nmuch gold and silver the Assyrians plundered from the temple of the\nLord? Is it not better that it should be melted down by the priest for\nthe sustenance of the poor, if other resources are wanting, than that it\nshould be carried away by a sacrilegious enemy? Will not the Lord say,\nWherefore hast thou suffered so many poor to die with hunger, and at the\nsame time hadst gold, with which thou mightest have supplied them with\nfood? Why have so many been carried away into captivity, and never been\nredeemed? Why have so many been slain by the enemy? It would have been\nbetter to preserve the vessels of living beings, than those of metals.\nTo these questions you could make no answer. For what would you say? I\nwas afraid that the temple of God would be destitute of ornament. God\nwould reply, The sacraments require no gold, nor is gold any\nrecommendation of that which is not purchased with gold. The ornament of\nthe sacraments is the redemption of captives.” In short, we see that it\nwas very true which was observed by the same writer in another place,\n“that whatever the Church possessed at that time, was appropriated to\nthe relief of the necessitous,” and “that all that a bishop had,\nbelonged to the poor.”\nIX. These, which we have enumerated, were the offices of the ancient\nChurch. Others, which are mentioned by ecclesiastical historians, were\nrather exercises and preparations, than certain offices. For to form a\nseminary, which should provide the Church with future ministers, those\nholy men took under their charge, protection, and discipline, such\nyouths as, with the consent and sanction of their parents, enlisted\nthemselves in the spiritual warfare; and so they educated them from an\nearly age, that they might not enter on the discharge of their office\nignorant and unprepared. All who were trained in this manner, were\ncalled by the general name of _clergy_. I could wish, indeed, that some\nother more appropriate name had been given them; for this appellation\noriginated in error, or at least in some improper views; for Peter calls\nthe whole Church _the clergy_, that is, _the inheritance of the\nLord_.[852] The institution itself, however, was pious and eminently\nbeneficial; that those who wished to consecrate themselves and their\nlabours to the Church, should be educated under the care of the bishop;\nthat no one might minister in the Church but one who had received\nsufficient previous instruction, who from his early youth had imbibed\nsound doctrine, who from a strict discipline had acquired a certain\nhabitual gravity, and more than common sanctity of life, who had been\nabstracted from secular occupations, and accustomed to spiritual cares\nand studies. Now, as young soldiers by counterfeit battles are trained\nto real and serious warfare, so the clergy were prepared by certain\nprobationary exercises, before they were actually promoted to offices.\nAt first they were charged with the care of opening and shutting the\ntemples, and they were called _ostiarii_, or _door-keepers_. Afterwards\nthey were called _acoluthi_, or _followers_, waiting upon the bishop in\ndomestic services, and accompanying him on all occasions, at first in a\nway of honour, and afterwards to prevent all suspicion; moreover, that\nby degrees they might become known to the people, and might acquire some\nconsideration among them, and at the same time that they might learn to\nbear the presence of all, and have courage to speak before them, that\nafter being made presbyters, when they should come to preach, they might\nnot be confounded with shame, therefore they were appointed to read the\nScriptures from the pulpit. In this manner they were promoted by\ndegrees, that they might approve their diligence in the respective\nexercises, till they were made subdeacons. I only contend, that these\nwere rather preparations for pupils, than functions reckoned among the\nreal offices of the Church.\nX. We have said, that the first point in the election of ministers\nrelated to the qualifications of the persons to be chosen, and the\nsecond to the religious reverence with which the business ought to be\nconducted. In both these points, the ancient Church followed the\ndirection of Paul and the examples of the apostles. For it was their\ncustom to assemble for the election of pastors with the greatest\nreverence and solemn invocation of the name of God. They had likewise a\nform of examination, in which they tried the life and doctrine of the\ncandidates by that standard of Paul. Only they ran into the error of\nimmoderate severity, from a wish to require in a bishop more than Paul\nrequires, and especially, in process of time, by enjoining celibacy. In\nother things their practice was in conformity with the description of\nPaul.[853] In the third point which we have mentioned, namely, by whom\nministers ought to be chosen, they did not always observe the same\norder. In the primitive times there was no one admitted among the number\nof the clergy, without the consent of all the people; so that Cyprian\nmakes a laboured defence of his having appointed one Aurelius a reader,\nwithout consulting the Church, because he departed in this instance from\nthe general custom, though not without reason. He begins in the\nfollowing manner: “In appointing the clergy, my very dear brethren, we\nare accustomed first to consult you, and to weigh the morals and merits\nof every one of them in the general assembly.” But as there was not much\ndanger in these inferior exercises, because they were admitted to a long\nprobation, and not to a high office, the consent of the people ceased to\nbe asked. Afterwards, in the other offices also, except the episcopate,\nthe people generally left the judgment and choice to the bishop and\npresbyters, so that they determined who were capable and deserving;\nexcept when new presbyters were appointed to the parishes, for then it\nwas necessary to have the express consent of the body of the people at\neach place. Nor is it any wonder that the people were not very\nsolicitous for the preservation of their right in this case. For no one\nwas made a subdeacon, who had not been tried for a considerable time as\none of the _clergy_, under the severe discipline which was then\npractised. After he had been tried in that station, he was constituted a\ndeacon; in which if he conducted himself with fidelity, he obtained the\nrank of a presbyter. Thus no one was promoted who had not really\nundergone an examination for many years, under the eyes of the people.\nAnd there were many canons for the punishment of their faults; so that\nthe Church could not be troubled with wicked presbyters or deacons,\nunless it neglected the remedies within its reach. The election of\npresbyters, however, always required the consent of the inhabitants of\nthe place; which is testified by the first canon, which is attributed to\nAnacletus. And all ordinations took place at stated times of the year,\nthat no one might be introduced clandestinely, without the consent of\nthe faithful, or be promoted with too much facility, without any\nattestation to his character.\nXI. The right of voting in the election of bishops was retained by the\npeople for a long time, that no one might be obtruded who was not\nacceptable to all. The Council of Antioch therefore decreed, that no\nbishop should be appointed without the consent of the people, which Leo\nthe First expressly confirms. Hence the following injunctions: “Let him\nbe chosen who shall be called for by the clergy and people, or at least\nby the majority of them.” Again: “Let him who is to preside over all, be\nchosen by all.” For he who is appointed without having been previously\nknown and examined, must of necessity be intruded by force. Again: “Let\nhim be elected who shall have been chosen by the clergy and desired by\nthe people; and let him be consecrated by the bishops of that province,\nwith the authority of the metropolitan.” So careful were the holy fathers\nthat this liberty of the people should not by any means be infringed,\nthat when the general council, assembled at Constantinople, appointed\nNectarius, they would not do it without the approbation of all the\nclergy and people; as is evident from their epistle to the Council of\nRome. Wherefore, when any bishop appointed his successor, the\nappointment was not confirmed but by the suffrages of all the people. Of\nsuch a circumstance we have not only an example, but the particular form\nin Augustine’s nomination of Eradius. And Theodoret, when he states that\nPeter was nominated by Athanasius as his successor, immediately adds,\nthat this was confirmed by the clergy, and ratified by the acclamations\nof the magistracy, the nobility, and all the people.\nXII. I confess that there was the greatest propriety in the decree of\nthe Council of Laodicea, that the election should not be left to the\npopulace. For it scarcely ever happens that so many heads concur in one\nopinion for the settlement of any business; and almost every case\nverifies the observation, that the uncertain vulgar are divided by\ncontrary inclinations. But to this danger was applied an excellent\nremedy. For in the first place, the clergy alone made their choice, and\npresented the person they had chosen to the magistracy, or to the senate\nand governors. They deliberated on the election, and if it appeared to\nthem a proper one, confirmed it, or otherwise chose another person whom\nthey preferred. Then the business was referred to the multitude, who,\nthough they were not bound to concur in these previous opinions, yet\nwere less likely to be thrown into disorder. Or if the business\ncommenced with the multitude, this method was adopted in order to\ndiscover who was the principal object of their wishes; and after hearing\nthe wishes of the people, the clergy proceeded to the election. Thus the\nclergy were neither at liberty to elect whom they pleased, nor under a\nnecessity of complying with the foolish desires of the people. This\norder is stated by Leo in another place, when he says, “It is requisite\nto have the votes of the citizens, the testimonies of the people, the\nauthority of the governors, and the election of the clergy.” Again: “Let\nthere be the testimony of the governors, the subscription of the clergy,\nthe consent of the senate and people. Reason permits it not to be done\nin any other way.” Nor is there any other meaning in that decree of the\nCouncil of Laodicea, than that the clergy and governors should not\nsuffer themselves to be carried away by the inconsiderate multitude, but\nby their prudence and gravity should check, on every necessary occasion,\nthe folly and violence of popular desires.\nXIII. This mode of election was still practised in the time of Gregory,\nand it is probable that it continued long after. There are many of his\nepistles which furnish sufficient evidence of this fact. For in every\ncase relating to the creation of a new bishop in any place, he was\naccustomed to write to the clergy, the senate, and the people; and\nsometimes to the duke, according to the constitution of the government\nin the place to which he was writing. And if, on account of disturbances\nor dissensions in any Church, he confides the superintendence of the\nelection to some neighbouring bishop, yet he invariably requires a\nsolemn decree confirmed by the subscriptions of all. Even when one\nConstantius was created bishop of Milan, and on account of the\nincursions of the barbarians, many of the Milanese had retired to Genoa,\nhe thought the election would not be legitimate, unless they also were\ncalled together, and gave their united consent. And what is more, it was\nwithin the last five hundred years that Pope Nicholas made this decree\nrespecting the election of the Roman pontiff; that the cardinals should\ntake the lead, that in the next place they should unite with them the\nrest of the clergy, and lastly that the election should be confirmed by\nthe consent of the people. And at the conclusion he recites that decree\nof Leo, which I have just quoted, and commands it to be observed in\nfuture. If the cabals of the wicked should go to such a length as to\nconstrain the clergy to quit the city in order to make a proper\nelection, still he ordains that some of the people should be present at\nthe same time. The consent of the emperor, as far as I can discover, was\nrequired only in two Churches, at Rome and at Constantinople, because\nthey were the two capitals of the empire. For when Ambrose was sent to\nMilan with authority from Valentinian to preside at the election of a\nnew bishop, that was an extraordinary measure, in consequence of the\ngrievous factions which raged among the citizens. At Rome the authority\nof the emperor had anciently so much influence in the creation of a\nbishop, that Gregory speaks of himself as having been appointed to the\ngovernment of the Church by the sole command of the emperor,\nnotwithstanding he had been formally chosen by the people. But the\ncustom was, that when any one had been chosen by the senate, clergy, and\npeople, it was immediately reported to the emperor, that he might either\nratify the election by his approbation, or rescind it by his negative.\nNor is there any thing repugnant to this custom in the decrees collected\nby Gratian; which only say, that it is by no means to be suffered that a\nking should supersede all canonical election by appointing a bishop at\nhis own pleasure, and that the metropolitans ought not to consecrate any\none who shall thus have been promoted by the violence of power. For it\nis one thing to spoil the Church of its right, by transferring the whole\nto the caprice of an individual, and another to give a king or an\nemperor the honour of confirming a legitimate election by his authority.\nXIV. It remains for us to state, by what ceremony the ministers of the\nancient Church, after their election, were initiated into their office.\nThis the Latins have called _ordination_ or _consecration_. The Greeks\nhave called it χειροτονια, _extension_ or _elevation of hands_, and\nsometimes χειροθεσια, _imposition of hands_; though the former word\nproperly signifies that kind of election in which the suffrages are\ndeclared by the lifting up of the hands. There is a decree of the\nCouncil of Nice, that the metropolitan should meet with all the bishops\nof the province, to ordain him who shall have been elected; but that if\nany of them be prevented by the length of the journey, by sickness, or\nby any other necessary cause, at least three should meet, and those who\nare absent should testify their consent by letters. And when this canon\nfrom disuse had grown obsolete, it was renewed in various councils. Now,\nthe reason why all, or at least as many as had no sufficient excuse,\nwere commanded to be present, was that there might be a more solemn\nexamination into the learning and morals of the person to be ordained;\nfor the business was not completed without examination. And it appears\nfrom the epistles of Cyprian, that in the beginning the bishops were not\ninvited after the election, but used to be present at the election, and\nthat for the purpose of acting as moderators, that nothing turbulent\nmight take place among the multitude. For after having said that the\npeople have the power either to choose the worthy for priests, or to\nreject the unworthy, he adds, “Wherefore it is to be carefully held and\nobserved as a Divine and apostolical tradition, (which is observed among\nus, and in almost all the provinces,) that for the due performance of\nordinations, all the neighbouring bishops of the same province should\nmeet with the people over whom a bishop is to be ordained, and that the\nbishop should be chosen in the presence of the people.” But because such\nan assembly was sometimes very slowly collected, and there was danger\nthat such a delay might be abused by some for the purposes of intrigue,\nit was deemed sufficient, if they assembled after the election was made,\nand upon due examination consecrated the person who had been chosen.\nXV. This was the universal practice, without any exception. By degrees a\ndifferent custom was introduced, and the persons elected went to the\nmetropolitan city to seek ordination. This change arose from ambition\nand a corruption of the ancient institution, rather than from any good\nreason. And not long after, when the authority of the see of Rome had\nincreased, another custom obtained, which was still worse; almost all\nthe bishops of Italy went to Rome to be consecrated. This may be seen by\nthe epistles of Gregory. Only a few cities, which did not so easily\nyield, preserved their ancient right; of which there is an example\nrecorded by him in the case of Milan. Perhaps the metropolitan cities\nwere the only ones that retained their privilege. For almost all the\nprovincial bishops used to assemble in the metropolitan city to\nconsecrate their archbishop. The ceremony was imposition of hands. For I\nread of no other ceremony practised, except that in the public assembly\nthe bishops had some dress to distinguish them from the rest of the\npresbyters. Presbyters and deacons also were ordained solely by\nimposition of hands. But every bishop ordained his own presbyters, in\nconjunction with the assembly of the other presbyters of his diocese.\nNow, though they all united in the same act, yet because the bishop took\nthe lead, and the ceremony was performed under his direction, therefore\nit was called his ordination. Wherefore it is often remarked by the\nancient writers, that a presbyter differs from a bishop in no other\nrespect, than that he does not possess the power of ordination.\nFootnote 848:\nTitus i. 9.\nFootnote 849:\nExod. xxxviii. 35.\nFootnote 850:\nActs xx. 26.\nFootnote 851:\n1 Tim. iii. 2, 3.\nFootnote 852:\n1 Peter v. 3.\nFootnote 853:\n1 Tim. iii. 2-7."

          "title": "CHAPTER V.",
          "content": "THE ANCIENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT ENTIRELY SUBVERTED BY THE PAPAL TYRANNY.\nNow, it is proper to exhibit the system of ecclesiastical government at\npresent maintained by the see of Rome, and all its dependencies, with a\nfull view of that hierarchy which is perpetually in their mouths, and to\ncompare it with the description we have given of the primitive and\nancient Church. This comparison will show what kind of a Church there is\namong those who fiercely arrogate this exclusive title, in order to\noppress, or rather to overwhelm us. Now, it is best to begin with the\nvocation, that we may see who and what kind of men are called to the\nministry, and how they are introduced to it. We shall then consider how\nfaithfully they discharge their duty. We shall give the first place to\nthe bishops; and I wish it might be to their honour to hold the first\nrank in this disquisition. But the subject itself will not permit me to\ntouch on this argument ever so slightly, without involving their deepest\ndisgrace. I shall remember, however, the nature of the work in which I\nam now engaged, and shall not suffer my discourse, which ought to be\nconfined to simple doctrine, to exceed its proper bounds. But let some\none of those who have not lost all shame, answer me; What kind of\nbishops are now generally chosen? To examine into their learning, is too\nobsolete; and if any regard be paid to it, they choose some lawyer, who\nunderstands pleading in a court, better than preaching in a Church. It\nis evident, that for a hundred years, scarcely one in a hundred that has\nbeen chosen, had any knowledge of the Holy Scripture. I say nothing of\nthe preceding ages; not that they were much better, but because our\nbusiness is only with the present Church. If we inquire into their\nmorals, we shall find that there have been few or none who would not\nhave been judged unworthy by the ancient canons. He who has not been a\ndrunkard, has been a fornicator; and he who has been free from both\nthese vices, has been either a gambler or a hunter, or dissolute in some\npart of his life. For the old canons exclude a man from the episcopal\noffice for smaller vices than these. But the greatest absurdity of all\nis, that even boys, scarcely ten years of age, have by the permission of\nthe pope been made bishops. And to such lengths of impudence and\nstupidity have they proceeded, as not to be afraid of that extreme and\nmonstrous enormity, which is altogether repugnant to the common sense of\nnature. Hence it appears how solemn and conscientious must have been\ntheir elections, which were marked with such extreme negligence.\nII. All the right of the people to choose has been entirely taken away.\nTheir suffrages, assent, subscriptions, and every thing of this kind,\nhave disappeared. All the power is transferred to the canons. They\nconfer the bishopric on whom they please, and then produce him before\nthe people, but to be adored, not to be examined. Leo, on the contrary,\nexclaims that no reason permits this, and pronounces it to be a violent\nimposition. When Cyprian declares it to be of Divine right, that an\nelection should not be made without the consent of the people, he shows\nthat a different method is repugnant to the word of God. The decrees of\nvarious councils most severely prohibit it to be done in any other way,\nand if it be done, command it to be void. If these things be true, there\nis now no canonical election remaining in all the Papacy, either\naccording to Divine or ecclesiastical right. Now, though there were no\nother evil, how will they be able to excuse themselves for having thus\ndeprived the Church of her right? But they say, the corruption of the\ntimes required, that as the people and magistrates, in the choice of\nbishops, were rather carried away by antipathies and partialities than\ngoverned by an honest and correct judgment, the decision of this\nbusiness should be intrusted to a few. Let it be admitted that this was\nan extreme remedy for a disease under desperate circumstances. Yet as\nthe medicine has been found more injurious than the disease itself, why\nis there no remedy provided against this new malady? They reply, The\ncanons themselves have been particularly directed what course they ought\nto pursue in an election. But do we doubt, that the people formerly\nunderstood themselves to be bound by the most sacred laws, when they saw\nthe word of God proposed as their rule, whenever they assembled for the\nelection of a bishop? For that one declaration of God, in which he\ndescribes the true character of a bishop, ought to have more weight than\nmillions of canons. Yet, corrupted by a most sinful disposition, they\npaid no regard to law or equity. So in the present day, though there are\nthe best written laws, yet they remain buried in paper. At the same\ntime, it has been the general practice, and, as if it were founded in\nreason, has obtained the general approbation, that drunkards,\nfornicators, and gamblers, have been promoted to this honour. I do not\nsay enough. Bishoprics are the rewards of adulterers and panders. For\nwhen they are given to hunters and fowlers, the business must be\nconsidered as well managed. To attempt any excuse of such flagitious\nproceedings is abominable. The people, I say, had a most excellent\ncanon, in the direction of the word of God, that “a bishop must be\nblameless, apt to teach, no striker,” &c.[854] Why, then, was the right\nof election transferred from the people to the canons? They reply,\nBecause the word of God was not attended to, amidst the tumults and\nfactions of the people. And why should it not now be again transferred\nfrom them, who not only violate all laws, but, casting off all shame,\nmingle and confound heaven and earth together, by their lust, avarice,\nand ambition?\nIII. But it is a false pretence when they say, that the present practice\nwas introduced as a remedy. We read that in the early times, cities were\nfrequently thrown into confusion at the election of their bishops; yet\nno one ever dared to think of depriving the citizens of their right. For\nthey had other ways, either of guarding against these evils, or of\ncorrecting them when they occurred. But I will state the real truth of\nthe case. When the people began to be negligent about choosing, and,\nconsidering this care as less suitable to themselves, left it to the\npresbyters, the latter abused this occasion to usurp a tyrannical power,\nwhich they afterwards confirmed to themselves by new canons. Their form\nof ordination is no other than a mere mockery. For the appearance of\nexamination which they display in it, is so frivolous and jejune, that\nit is even destitute of all plausibility. The power of nominating\nbishops, therefore, which some princes have obtained by stipulation with\nthe Roman pontiff, has caused no new injury to the Church, because the\nelection has only been taken from the canons, who had seized, or rather\nstolen, it without any just claim. It is certainly a most disgraceful\nexample, that courtiers are made bishops, and sent from the court to\nseize upon the Churches; and it ought to be the concern of all pious\nprinces to refrain from such an abuse. For it is an impious robbery of\nthe Church, whenever a bishop is imposed upon any people, who have not\ndesired, or at least freely approved of him. But the disorderly custom\nwhich has long prevailed in the Churches, has given occasion to princes\nto assume the presentation of bishops to themselves. For they would\nrather have this at their own disposal, than in the hands of those who\nhad no more right to it, and by whom it was not less abused.\nIV. This is the goodly calling, in consequence of which bishops boast of\nbeing successors of the apostles. The power of creating presbyters, they\nsay, belongs exclusively to them. But this is a gross corruption of the\nancient institution; for by their ordination they create, not presbyters\nto rule and feed the people, but priests to offer sacrifice. So when\nthey consecrate deacons, they have nothing to do with their true and\nproper office, but only ordain them to certain ceremonies about the\nchalice and patine. In the Council of Chalcedon, on the contrary, it was\ndecreed, that there should be no absolute ordinations, that is, without\nsome place being at the same time assigned to the persons ordained,\nwhere they were to exercise their office. This decree was highly useful,\nfor two reasons—first, that the Churches might not be burdened with an\nunnecessary charge, and the money which ought to be distributed to the\npoor consumed upon idle men; secondly, that the persons ordained might\nconsider themselves not as promoted to an honour, but as intrusted with\nan office to the discharge of which they were bound by a solemn\nengagement. But the Romish doctors, who think their belly ought to be\nall their care, even in matters of religion, first explain the requisite\ntitle to consist in an income sufficient for their support, whether\narising from their own patrimony or from a benefice. Therefore, when\nthey ordain a deacon or a presbyter, without giving themselves any\nconcern where he is to officiate, they readily admit him, if he be only\nrich enough to maintain himself. But who can admit this, that the title\nwhich the decree of the council requires is a competent annual income?\nAnd because the more recent canons condemned the bishops to maintain\nthose whom they had ordained without a sufficient title, in order to\nprevent their too great facility in the admission of candidates, they\nhave even contrived a way to evade this penalty. For the person ordained\nmentions any title whatever, and promises that he will be content with\nit. By this engagement he is debarred from an action for maintenance. I\nsay nothing of a thousand frauds practised in this business; as when\nsome falsely exhibit empty titles of benefices, from which they could\nnot derive five pence a year; others, under a secret stipulation, borrow\nbenefices which they promise to return immediately, but which, in many\ninstances, are never returned; and other similar mysteries.\nV. But even though these grosser abuses were removed, is it not always\nabsurd to ordain a presbyter without assigning him any station? For they\nordain no one, but to offer sacrifice. Now, the legitimate ordination of\na presbyter consists in a call to the government of the Church, and that\nof a deacon to the collection of the alms. They adorn their procedure,\nindeed, with many pompous ceremonies, that its appearance may gain the\nveneration of the simple; but with judicious persons, what can be gained\nby those appearances unaccompanied by any solidity or truth? For they\nuse ceremonies either derived from Judaism, or invented among\nthemselves, from which it would be better to refrain. But as to any real\nexamination, the consent of the people, and other necessary things, they\nare not mentioned. The shadow they retain of these things, I consider\nnot worthy of notice. By shadow, I mean those ridiculous gesticulations,\nused as a dull and foolish imitation of antiquity. The bishops have\ntheir vicars, to inquire before an ordination, into the learning of the\ncandidates. But in what manner? They interrogate them, whether they can\nread their masses; whether they know how to decline some common noun\nthat may occur in reading, or to conjugate a verb, or to tell the\nmeaning of a word; for it is not necessary for them to know how to give\nthe sense of a verse. And yet none are rejected from the priesthood, who\nare deficient even in these puerile elements, provided they bring some\npresent or recommendation to favour. In the same spirit it is, that when\nthe persons to be ordained present themselves at the altar, some one\ninquires three times, in a language not understood, whether they are\nworthy of that honour. One (who never saw them before, but, that no part\nof the process might be wanting, acts his part in the farce) answers,\nThey are worthy. What accusation is there against these venerable\nfathers, but that by sporting with such manifest sacrileges they are\nguilty of unblushing mockery of God and men? But because they have been\nlong in possession of it, they suppose it is now become right. For\nwhoever ventures to open his mouth against these glaring and atrocious\nenormities, they hurry him away to execution, as if he had committed a\ncapital crime. Would they do this if they believed that there was any\nGod?\nVI. Now, how much better do they conduct themselves in the collation of\nbenefices?—a thing formerly connected with ordination, but now entirely\nseparated from it. The ways in which this business is managed, are\nvarious. For the bishops are not the only persons who confer benefices,\nand in those the collation of which is ascribed to them, they do not\nalways possess the full power, but while they retain the name of the\ncollation for the sake of honour, the presentation belongs to others.\nBesides these, there are nominations from the colleges, resignations\neither absolute or made for the sake of exchange, commendatory\nrescripts, preventions, and the like. But they all conduct themselves in\nsuch a manner, that no one can reproach another for any thing. I\nmaintain that scarcely one benefice in a hundred, in all the Papacy, is\nat present conferred without simony, according to the definition which\nthe ancients gave of that crime. I do not say that they all purchase\nwith ready money; but show me one in twenty who obtains a benefice\nwithout any indirect recommendation. Some are promoted by relationship,\nothers by alliance, others by the influence of parents, others gain\nfavour by their services. In short, the end for which sacerdotal offices\nare conferred, is not to provide for the Churches, but for the persons\nto whom they are given. And therefore they call them _benefices_, a name\nby which they sufficiently declare that they view them in no other light\nthan as donatives of princes, by which they either conciliate the favour\nof their soldiers, or reward their services. I forbear to remark that\nthese rewards are conferred upon barbers, cooks, muleteers, and other\ndregs of the people. And, in the present day, scarcely any litigations\nmake more noise in the courts of justice than those respecting\nbenefices; so that they may be considered as a mere prey thrown out for\ndogs to hunt after. Is it tolerable even to hear the name of _pastors_\ngiven to men who have forced themselves into the possession of a Church,\nas into an enemy’s farm; who have obtained it by a legal process; who\nhave purchased it with money; who have gained it by dishonourable\nservices; who, while infants just beginning to lisp, succeeded to it as\nan inheritance transmitted by their uncles and cousins, and sometimes\neven by fathers to their illegitimate children?\nVII. Would the licentiousness of the people, however corrupt and\nlawless, ever have proceeded to such a length? But it is still more\nmonstrous that one man—I say nothing of his qualifications, only a man\nnot capable of governing himself—should preside over the government of\nfive or six Churches. We may now see, in the courts of princes, young\nmen who hold one archbishopric, two bishoprics, and three abbeys. It is\na common thing for canons to be loaded with five, six, or seven\nbenefices, of which they take not the least care, except in receiving\nthe revenues. I will not object that this is every where condemned by\nthe word of God, which has long ceased to have the least weight with\nthem. I will not object that various councils have made many very severe\ndecrees against such disorder; for these also, whenever they please,\nthey fearlessly treat with contempt. But I maintain, that both these\nthings are execrable enormities, utterly repugnant to God, to nature,\nand to the government of the Church—that one robber should engross\nseveral Churches at once, and that the name of _pastor_ should be given\nto one who could not be present with his flock, even if he would; and\nyet, such is their impudence, they cover these abominable impurities\nwith the name of the Church, in order to exempt them from all censure.\nAnd, moreover, that inviolable succession, to the merit of which they\nboast that the Church owes its perpetual preservation, is included in\nthese iniquities.\nVIII. Now, let us see how faithfully they exercise their office, which\nis the second mark by which we are to judge of a legitimate pastor. Of\nthe priests whom they create, some are _monks_, others are called\n_seculars_. The former of these classes was unknown to the ancient\nChurch, and to hold such a place in the Church was so incompatible with\nthe monastic profession, that anciently, when any one was chosen from a\nmonastery to be one of the clergy, he ceased to be a monk. And even\nGregory, in whose time there was much corruption, yet suffered not this\nconfusion to take place. For he enjoined, that they who became abbots\nshould be divested of their clerical character; for that no one could be\na monk and a clergyman at the same time, because the one would be an\nimpediment to the other. Now, if I inquire how that man can duly\ndischarge his office, whom the canons declare to be unfit for it, what\nanswer will they make? I suppose they will cite those abortive decrees\nof Innocent and Boniface, by which monks are admitted to the honour and\nauthority of the priesthood, so that they may still remain in their\nmonasteries. But what reason is there, that any illiterate ass, as soon\nas he has once occupied the see of Rome, should by one diminutive word\noverturn all the usages of antiquity? But of this we shall say more\nhereafter. Suffice it at present to remark, that during the purer times\nof the Church, it was deemed a great absurdity for a monk to hold the\noffice of a priest. For Jerome denies that he performed the office of a\npriest while he lived among the monks; but represents himself as one of\nthe people who ought to be governed by the priests. But if we grant them\nthis point, how do they execute their office? There are some of the\nmendicants, and a few of the others, who preach. All the rest of the\nmonks either chant or mutter over masses in their cloisters, as if it\nwere the design of Jesus Christ that presbyters should be appointed for\nthis purpose, or as if the nature of their office admitted of it. While\nthe Scripture clearly testifies that it is the duty of a presbyter to\ngovern his own Church,[855] is it not an impious profanation to transfer\nto another object, or rather to make a total change in, God’s sacred\ninstitution? For when they are ordained monks, they are expressly\nforbidden to do things which the Lord enjoins upon all presbyters. This\ndirection is given to them: Let a monk be content in his cloister, and\nnot presume to administer the sacraments, or to execute any other branch\nof public duty. Let them deny, if they can, that it is a glaring mockery\nof God, to create a presbyter in order that he may refrain from\ndischarging his true and genuine office, and to give a man the name, who\ncannot possess the thing.\nIX. I proceed to the seculars; of whom some are called _beneficiaries_,\nthat is, they have benefices by which they are maintained; others hire\nthemselves to labour by the day, in saying mass or singing, and live on\nthe wages which they gain from these employments. Benefices are either\nattended with cure of souls, as bishoprics and parishes; or they are the\nstipends of delicate men, who gain a livelihood by chanting, as\nprebends, canonries, dignities, chaplainships, and the like. But in the\nconfusion which has been introduced, abbeys and priories are conferred\nnot only on secular priests, but also on boys, by privilege, that is, by\ncommon and ordinary custom. As to the mercenaries, who seek their daily\nsustenance, how could they act otherwise than they do, that is, to offer\nthemselves to hire in a mean and shameful manner; especially among such\na vast multitude as now swarms in the world? Therefore, when they are\nashamed of open begging, or think they should gain but little by that\npractice, they run about like hungry dogs, and by their importunity, as\nby barking, extort from reluctant hands some morsels to put into their\nmouths. Here if I should endeavour to describe what a great disgrace it\nis to the Church, that the office and dignity of the presbytery has been\nso degraded, there would be no end. My readers, therefore, have no\nreason to expect from me a long discourse, corresponding to such a\nflagitious enormity. I only assert, in few words, that if it be the duty\nof a presbyter, as the word of God prescribes, and the ancient canons\nrequire, to feed the Church and administer the spiritual kingdom of\nChrist,[856] all those priests who have no work or wages, except in\nmaking merchandise of masses, not only fail of executing their office,\nbut have no legitimate office to execute. For there is no place assigned\nto them to teach; they have no people to govern. In short, nothing\nremains to them but the altar upon which to offer up Christ in\nsacrifice; and this is not sacrificing to God, but to demons, as we\nshall see in another place.\nX. Here I touch not on the external vices, but only on the intestine\nevil which is deeply rooted in their institution, and cannot be\nseparated from it. I shall add a remark, which will sound harshly in\ntheir ears, but because it is true, it must be expressed—that canons,\ndeans, chaplains, provosts, and all who are supported by sinecures, are\nto be considered in the same light. For what service can they perform\nfor the Church? They have discarded the preaching of the word, the\nsuperintendence of discipline, and the administration of the sacraments,\nas employments attended with too much labour and trouble. What have they\nremaining, then, to boast of as true presbyters? They have chanting and\nthe pomp of ceremonies. But what is all this to the purpose? If they\nplead custom, usage, prescription of long continuance, I will confront\nthem with the decision of Christ, where he has given us a description of\ntrue presbyters, and what qualifications ought to be possessed by those\nwho wish to be considered as such. If they cannot bear so hard a law as\nto submit themselves to the rule of Christ, let them at least allow this\ncause to be decided by the authority of the primitive Church. But their\ncondition will not be at all better, if we judge of their state by the\nancient canons. Those who have degenerated into canons, ought to be\npresbyters, as they were in former times, to govern the Church in common\nwith the bishop, and to be his colleagues in the pastoral office. These\n_chapter dignities_, as they call them, have nothing to do with the\ngovernment of the Church; much less have the chaplainships, and the\nother dregs of similar offices. In what estimation, then, shall we hold\nthem all? It is certain that the word of Christ and the practice of the\nancient Church agree in excluding them from the honour of the\npresbytery. They contend, however, that they are presbyters; but the\nmask must be torn off. Then we shall find, that their whole profession\nis most foreign and remote from the office of presbyters, which is\ndescribed to us by the apostles, and which was required in the primitive\nChurch. All such orders, therefore, by whatever titles they may be\ndistinguished, since they are of modern invention, or at least are not\nsupported by the institution of God, or the ancient usage of the Church,\nought to have no place in a description of the spiritual government,\nwhich the Church has received, consecrated by the mouth of the Lord\nhimself. Or, if they wish me to use plainer language, since chaplains,\ncanons, deans, provosts, and other idlers of this description, do not\neven with their little fingers touch a particle of that duty which is\nnecessarily required in presbyters, it is not to be endured that they\nshould falsely usurp the honour, and thus violate the sacred institution\nof Jesus Christ.\nXI. There remain the bishops and the rectors of parishes, who would\nafford me great pleasure if they exerted themselves to support their\noffice. For we would readily admit to them, that they have a pious and\nhonourable office, provided they discharged it. But when they wish to be\nconsidered as pastors, notwithstanding they desert the churches\ncommitted to them, and transfer the care of them to others, they act\njust as if the office of a pastor consisted in doing nothing. If a\nusurer, who never stirred his foot out of the city, should profess\nhimself a ploughman or vinedresser,—if a soldier, who had spent all his\ntime in the camp and in the field of battle, and had never seen a court\nof justice or books, should offer himself as a lawyer,—who could endure\nsuch gross absurdities? But these men act in a manner still more absurd,\nwho wish to be accounted and called legitimate pastors of the Church,\nand yet are not willing to be so in reality. For how few of them are\nthere, who execute the government of their Churches even in appearance!\nMany of them all their lifetime devour the revenues of Churches, which\nthey never approach even to look at them. Others either go themselves,\nor send an agent once every year, that nothing may be lost by farming\nthem out. When this abuse first intruded itself, they who wished to\nenjoy this kind of vacation from duty, exempted themselves by special\nprivileges. Now, it is a rare case for any one to reside in his own\nChurch; for they consider their Churches as no other than farms, over\nwhich they place their vicars, as bailiffs or stewards. But it is\nrepugnant to common sense, that a man should be pastor of a flock, who\nnever saw one of the sheep.\nXII. It appears that some seeds of this evil had sprung up in the time\nof Gregory, and that the rectors of Churches began to be negligent in\npreaching and teaching; for he heavily complains of it in the following\npassages: “The world is full of priests; but yet there are few labourers\nfound in the harvest; because we undertake the sacerdotal office, but\nperform not the work of the office.” Again: “Because they have no bowels\nof charity, they wish to be considered as lords; they do not acknowledge\nthemselves to be fathers. They change the place of humility into an\naggrandizement of dominion.” Again: “But, O ye pastors, what are we\ndoing, who receive the wages and are not labourers? We have fallen into\nextraneous employments; we undertake one thing, and perform another. We\nrelinquish the office of preaching; and it is our misfortune, I\nconceive, that we are called bishops, since we hold a title of honour,\nbut not of virtue.” Since he uses such severity of language against\nthose who were only chargeable with a want of sufficient assiduity, or\ndiligence, in their office, what would he have said, if he had seen\nscarcely any, or very few of the bishops, and among the rest hardly one\nin a hundred, ascend a pulpit once in their lives? For things are come\nto such a pitch of frenzy, that it is generally esteemed beneath the\ndignity of a bishop to deliver a sermon to a congregation. In the time\nof Bernard there had been some declension; but we see how sharply he\nreproves and inveighs against the whole body of the clergy, who, it is\nprobable, however, were far less corrupt in that age than they are in\nthe present.\nXIII. Now, if any one will closely observe and strictly examine this\nwhole form of ecclesiastical government, which exists at the present day\nunder the Papacy, he will find it a nest of the most lawless and\nferocious banditti in the world. Every thing in it is clearly so\ndissimilar and repugnant to the institution of Christ, so degenerated\nfrom the ancient regulations and usages of the Church, so at variance\nwith nature and reason, that no greater injury can be done to Christ,\nthan by pleading his name in defence of such a disorderly government. We\n(they say) are the pillars of the Church, the prelates of religion, the\nvicars of Christ, the heads of the faithful, because we have succeeded\nto the power and authority of the apostles. They are perpetually\nvaunting of these fooleries, as if they were talking to blocks of wood;\nbut whenever they repeat these boasts, I will ask them in return, what\nthey have in common with the apostles. For the question is not\nrespecting any hereditary honour, which may be given to men while they\nare asleep, but of the office of preaching, which they so carefully\navoid. So, when we assert that their kingdom is the tyranny of\nAntichrist, they immediately reply, that it is that venerable hierarchy,\nwhich has been so often commended by great and holy men. As though the\nholy fathers, when they praised the ecclesiastical hierarchy, or\nspiritual government, as it had been delivered to them by the hands of\nthe apostles, ever dreamed of this chaos of deformity and desolation,\nwhere the bishops for the most part are illiterate asses, unacquainted\nwith the first and plainest rudiments of the faith, or, in some\ninstances, are children just out of leading-strings; and if any be more\nlearned,—which, however, is a rare case,—they consider a bishopric to be\nnothing but a title of splendour and magnificence; where the rectors of\nChurches think no more of feeding the flock, than a shoemaker does of\nploughing; where all things are confounded with a dispersion worse than\nthat of Babel, so that there can no longer be seen any clear vestige of\nthe administration practised in the time of the fathers.\nXIV. What if we proceed to inquire into their manners? “Where is that\nlight of the world,” which Christ requires? where that “salt of the\nearth?”[857] where that sanctity, which might serve as a perpetual\nexample to others? There is no class of men in the present day more\ninfamous for profusion, delicacy, luxury, and profligacy of every kind;\nno class of men contains more apt or expert masters of every species of\nimposture, fraud, treachery, and perfidy; nowhere can be found equal\ncunning or audacity in the commission of crime. I say nothing of their\npride, haughtiness, rapacity, and cruelty; I say nothing of the\nabandoned licentiousness of every part of their lives;—enormities which\nthe world is so wearied with bearing, that there is no room for the\nleast apprehension lest I should be charged with excessive exaggeration.\nOne thing I assert, which it is not in their power to deny—that there is\nscarcely one of the bishops, and not one in a hundred of the parochial\nclergy, who, if sentence were to be passed upon his conduct according to\nthe ancient canons, would not be excommunicated, or, at the very least,\ndeposed from his office. That ancient discipline, which required a more\naccurate investigation to be made into the conduct of the clergy, has so\nlong been obsolete, that I may be considered as making an incredible\nassertion; but such is the fact. Now, let all, who fight under the\nstandards and auspices of the Roman see, go and boast of their\nsacerdotal order. It is evident that the order which they have is not\nderived from Christ, from his apostles, from the fathers, or from the\nancient Church.\nXV. Now, let the deacons come forward, with that most sacred\ndistribution which they have of the property of the Church. They do not\nat present, however, create their deacons for any such purpose; for they\nenjoin them nothing but to serve at the altar, to say or chant the\ngospel, and do I know not what trifles. Nothing of the alms, nothing of\nthe care of the poor, nothing of the whole function which they executed\nin primitive times. I speak of the institution itself. For if we advert\nto the fact, it is now become no office at all, but only a step towards\nthe priesthood. In one circumstance, those who act the part of a deacon\nat the mass, exhibit a useless and frivolous resemblance of antiquity,\nin receiving the offerings before the consecration. Now, it was the\nancient custom, that before the communion of the supper, the faithful\nkissed each other, and then offered their alms at the altar; thus they\nexpressed their charity, first by a sign, and then by active\nbeneficence. The deacon, who was steward for the poor, received what was\ngiven, in order to distribute it. Of the alms given at present, no more\nreaches the poor than if they were thrown into the sea. This false\nappearance of deaconship, therefore, is a mockery of the Church. It\ncontains nothing resembling the apostolic institution, or the ancient\nusage. Even the distribution of the property they have turned into\nanother channel; and have ordered it in such a way, that it is\nimpossible to imagine any thing more disorderly. For as robbers, after\nhaving murdered some ill-fated travellers, divide the plunder among\nthemselves, so these men, after having extinguished the light of God’s\nword, and, as it were, cut the throat of the Church, have concluded that\nwhatever had been dedicated to sacred uses, was abandoned to plunder and\nrapine. They have therefore made a division of it, and every one has\nseized as large a share as he could.\nXVI. Here, all the ancient usages which we have described, have not only\nbeen disturbed, but entirely expunged and abolished The principal part\nof this plunder was seized by the bishops and the presbyters of cities,\nwho, being enriched by it, were converted into canons. That the\npartition was made in confusion is evident from the contentions which\nprevail among them, even to this day, about their respective limits.\nBut, however it may be managed, they have taken care that not a penny of\nall the property of the Church should reach the poor, who were at least\nentitled to half of it. For the canons expressly allot them one fourth\npart, and assign another fourth part to the bishops, to be laid out in\nhospitality and other offices of charity. I say nothing of what the\nclergy ought to do with their portion, and to what use they ought to\napply it. The residue, which is appropriated to the reparation of\ntemples, edifices, and other expenses, it has been sufficiently shown,\nought to be at the service of the poor in time of necessity. If they had\na single spark of the fear of God in their hearts, could they bear this\nreflection of conscience, that every thing they eat, and drink, and\nwear, is the fruit of robbery, and even of sacrilege? But though they\nare little affected with the judgment of God, they should at least\nconsider that those, whom they wish to persuade into a belief of their\npossession of such an excellent and well regulated system in their\nChurch as they are accustomed to boast, are men endued with sense and\nreason. Let them answer me, in a word, whether deaconship be a license\nfor theft and robbery? If they deny this, they will also be obliged to\nconfess, that they have no such office left; seeing that among them the\nwhole administration of the revenues of the Church has been openly\nperverted into a system of sacrilegious depredation.\nXVII. But here they advance a most plausible plea. They allege that the\ndignity of the Church is becomingly sustained by this magnificence. And\nsuch is the impudence of some of their faction, that they dare to boast\nin express terms, that this princely state of the priesthood constitutes\nthe only fulfilment of those predictions in which the ancient prophets\ndescribe the splendour of the kingdom of Christ. It is not in vain, they\nsay, that God has made the following promises to his Church: “The kings\nof Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba\nand Seba shall offer gifts. Yea, all kings shall fall down before\nhim.”[858] “Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy\nbeautiful garments, O Jerusalem.”[859] “All they from Sheba shall come;\nthey shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises\nof the Lord. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto\nthee.”[860] If I should dwell long on a refutation of this presumption,\nI fear I should expose myself to the charge of folly. Therefore I am not\ninclined to spend my words in vain. But I ask, if any Jew were to abuse\nthese passages in the same manner, what reply would they make to him?\nThere is no doubt but they would reprove his stupidity, in transferring\nto the flesh and the world things which are spiritually spoken of the\nspiritual kingdom of the Messiah. For we know that, under the image of\nearthly things, the prophets have represented to us the heavenly glory\nof God, which ought to shine in the Church. For of those external\nblessings which their words express, the Church never had less abundance\nthan in the days of the apostles; and yet it is acknowledged by all that\nthe kingdom of Christ, then flourished in its greatest vigour. What,\nthen, it will be asked, is the meaning of these passages? I reply, that\nevery thing precious, high, and excellent, ought to be in subjection to\nthe Lord. In regard to the express declaration, that kings shall submit\ntheir sceptres to Christ, cast their crowns at his feet, and consecrate\ntheir wealth to the Church, when (they will say) was it more truly and\nfully exemplified, than when Theodosius, casting off the purple robes,\nand relinquishing the ensigns of imperial majesty, submitted himself,\nlike one of the common people, to do solemn penance before God and the\nChurch? than when he and other such pious princes devoted their cares\nand exertions to the preservation of pure doctrine in the Church, and to\nthe support and protection of sound teachers? But how far the priests of\nthat age were from rioting in superfluous riches, a single expression of\nthe Council of Aquileia, at which Ambrose presided, sufficiently\ndeclares. “Poverty is honourable in the priests of the Lord.” It is true\nthat the bishops at that time had some wealth, which they might have\nemployed to display the honour of the Church, if they had considered\nthem as the Church’s real ornaments. But knowing that there was nothing\nmore inconsistent with the office of pastors, than to display and to\npride themselves on the luxury of their tables, the splendour of their\napparel, a large retinue, and magnificent palaces, they followed and\nmaintained the humility and modesty, and even the poverty which Christ\nhas consecrated in all his ministers.\nXVIII. But not to dwell too long on this point, let us again collect\ninto a brief summary, how very much the present dispensation, or rather\ndissipation, of the property of the Church, differs from that true\noffice of deacons, which the word of God commends to us, and which the\nancient Church observed. That portion which is employed in the ornaments\nof temples, I assert, is grossly misapplied, if it be not regulated by\nthat moderation which the nature of sacred things requires, and which\nthe apostles and holy fathers have prescribed both by precept and by\nexamples. But what is there seen like this, in the temples at the\npresent day? Whatever is conformable, I do not say to that primitive\nfrugality, but to any honourable mediocrity, is rejected. Nothing\npleases, but what savours of the profusion and corruption of the present\ntimes. At the same time they are so far from feeling any just concern\nfor the living temples, that they would suffer thousands of the poor to\nperish with hunger, rather than convert the smallest chalice or silver\npitcher into money, to relieve their wants. And, not of myself to\npronounce any thing more severe, I would only request my pious readers\nto indulge this one reflection. If it could happen that Exuperius,—that\nbishop of Toulouse whom we have mentioned,—if Acacius, if Ambrose, or\nany other such,—should be raised from the dead, what would they say? In\nsuch extreme necessity of the poor, they surely would not approve of the\nriches of the Church being applied to another use, and that an\nunnecessary one. I forbear to remark, that these purposes for which they\nare employed, even if there were no poor, are in many respects\ninjurious, but of no utility whatever. But I will not appeal to the\nauthority of men. The property has been dedicated to Christ, and\ntherefore ought to be dispensed according to his will. It will be\nuseless for them to allege, that this portion has been employed for\nChrist, which they have squandered in a manner inconsistent with his\ncommand. To confess the truth, however, there is not much of the\nordinary revenue of the Church lost in these expenses. For there are no\nbishoprics so opulent, no abbeys so rich, in short, no benefices so\nnumerous or ample, as to satisfy the voraciousness of the priests.\nWishing to spare themselves, therefore, they induce the people, from\nsuperstitious motives, to take what ought to be bestowed upon the poor,\nand apply it to the building of temples, the erection of statues, the\npurchase of chalices and shrines for relics, and the provision of costly\nvestments. This is the gulf which swallows up all the daily alms.\nXIX. Of the revenue which they derive from lands and possessions, what\ncan I say more than I have already said, and which is evident to the\nobservation of all men? We see with what fidelity the principal portion\nis disposed of by those who are called bishops and abbots. What folly is\nit to seek here for any ecclesiastical order! Was it reasonable that\nthey, whose life ought to be an eminent example of frugality, modesty,\ntemperance, and humility, should emulate the pomp of princes, in the\nnumber of their attendants, the splendour of their palaces, the elegance\nof their apparel, and the luxury of their tables? And how very\ninconsistent it was with the office of those whom the eternal and\ninviolable decree of God forbids to be greedy of filthy lucre,[861] and\ncommands to be content with simple fare, not only to lay their hands\nupon towns and castles, but to seize on the largest provinces, and even\nto assume the reins of empire! If they despise the word of God, what\nreply will they make to those ancient decrees of councils, by which it\nis ordained that a bishop shall have a small house near the Church, a\nfrugal table, and humble furniture? What will they say to that sentence\nof the Council of Aquileia, which declares poverty to be honourable in\nthe priests of the Lord? For the direction given by Jerome to Nepotian,\nthat poor persons and strangers, and Christ among them, should be\nfamiliar guests at his table, they will perhaps reject as too austere.\nBut they will be ashamed to contradict what he immediately\nsubjoins—“that it is the glory of a bishop to provide for the poor, and\nthe disgrace of all priests to seek to enrich themselves.” Yet they\ncannot receive this, but they must all condemn themselves to ignominy.\nBut it is not necessary to pursue them with any further severity at\npresent, as it was only my intention to show, that the legitimate office\nof deacon has long been entirely abolished among them, to prevent their\ncontinuing to pride themselves on this title, for the purpose of\nrecommending their Church. And this design, I think, I have fully\naccomplished.\nFootnote 854:\n1 Tim. iii. 2-7.\nFootnote 855:\nActs xx. 28.\nFootnote 856:\n1 Cor. iv. 1.\nFootnote 857:\nMatt. v. 13, 14.\nFootnote 858:\nPsalm lxxii. 10, 11.\nFootnote 859:\nIsaiah iii. 1.\nFootnote 860:\nIsaiah lx. 6, 7.\nFootnote 861:\nTitus i. 7."

          "title": "CHAPTER VI.",
          "content": "THE PRIMACY OF THE ROMAN SEE.\nHitherto we have treated of those ecclesiastical orders which existed in\nthe government of the ancient Church, but which afterwards, in process\nof time, being corrupted and gradually more and more perverted, now in\nthe Papal Church merely retain their names, while in reality they are\nnothing but masks. And this we have done, that by the comparison the\npious reader might judge what sort of a Church the Romanists have, for\nthe sake of which they represent us as guilty of schism, because we have\nseparated from it. But the head and summit of the whole establishment,\nthat is, the primacy of the Roman see, by which they endeavour to prove\nthat the Catholic Church is exclusively theirs, we have not yet touched\non; because it originated neither in the institution of Christ nor in\nthe usage of the ancient Church, as did the other offices, which we have\nshown were handed down from antiquity, but since, through the corruption\nof the times, have degenerated, and even assumed altogether a new form.\nAnd yet they endeavour to persuade the world, that the principal and\nalmost only bond of the unity of the Church is adherence to the see of\nRome, and perseverance in obedience to it. This is the foundation on\nwhich they principally rest, when they wish to deny us all claim to the\nChurch, and to arrogate it to themselves; that they retain the head, on\nwhich the unity of the Church depends, and without which it must be torn\nasunder and crumble to pieces. For their notion is, that the Church is\nlike a mutilated and headless body, unless it be subject to the Roman\nsee as its head. Therefore, when they dispute respecting their\nhierarchy, they always commence with this axiom, that the Roman pontiff,\nas the vicar of Christ, who is Head of the Church, presides over the\nuniversal Church in his stead, and that the Church cannot be well\nconstituted, unless that see holds the primacy above all others.\nWherefore it is necessary to discuss this subject also, that nothing\nbelonging to the good government of the Church may be omitted.\nII. Let the question, therefore, be stated thus: Whether it be necessary\nto the true system of what they call the hierarchy or government of the\nChurch, that one see should have the preëminence above all the rest in\ndignity and power, so as to be the head of the whole body. Now, we\nsubject the Church to very unreasonable laws, if we impose this\nnecessity upon it without the word of God. Therefore, if our adversaries\nwish to gain their cause, it is necessary for them, in the first place,\nto show that this economy was instituted by Christ. For this purpose\nthey allege the high-priesthood ordained in the law, and the supreme\njurisdiction of the high-priest which God appointed at Jerusalem. But it\nis easy to give an answer to this, or, indeed, various answers, if they\nwould not be satisfied with one. In the first place, there is no reason\nfor extending to the whole world what was useful in a single nation; on\nthe contrary, the case of a single nation and that of the whole world\nare widely different. Because the Jews were surrounded on all sides with\nidolaters, God, in order to prevent their being distracted by a variety\nof religions, fixed the seat of his worship in the centre of the\ncountry, and there he set over them one principal priest, to whom they\nwere all to be subject, for the better preservation of unity among them.\nNow, when the true religion has been diffused over the whole world, who\ndoes not perceive it to be utterly absurd to assign the government of\nthe east and west to one man? It is just as if it were contended, that\nthe whole world ought to be governed by one magistrate, because there is\nonly one in a small district. But there is another reason why this ought\nnot to be made a precedent for imitation. Every one knows that the\nJewish high-priest was a type of Christ: now that the priesthood has\nbeen transferred, that right must also be transferred. To whom, then, is\nit transferred? Certainly not to the pope, as he impudently presumes to\nboast, when he assumes this title to himself; but to Christ, who\nexercises that office alone without vicar or successor, and resigns the\nhonour to no other. For this priesthood, which was prefigured in the\nlaw, consists not only in preaching or doctrine, but in the propitiation\nof God, which Christ effected in his death, and in that intercession\nwhich he is now making with the Father.\nIII. There is no reason, therefore, why they should confine us to this\nexample, as if it were a law perpetually binding, whereas we see it was\nonly of temporary duration. From the New Testament they have nothing to\nadduce in support of their opinion, but that it was said to one, “Thou\nart Peter; and upon this rock I will build my Church.”[862] Again:\n“Peter, lovest thou me? Feed my sheep.”[863] But to render these proofs\nsubstantial, it is necessary for them first to show that he who is\ncommanded to feed the flock of Christ, is invested with authority over\nall Churches, and that binding and loosing are no other than governing\nthe whole world. But as Peter had received the command from the Lord to\nfeed the Church, so he exhorts all other presbyters to do the same.[864]\nHence it is easy to infer, that this charge of Christ conferred nothing\npeculiar upon Peter beyond others, or that Peter communicated equally to\nothers the right which he had received. But, not to dispute to no\npurpose, we have in another place, from the mouth of Christ himself, a\nclear explanation of what he intends by _binding_ and _loosing_, namely,\n“remitting and retaining sins.”[865] The manner of _binding_ and\n_loosing_ is shown by the whole tenor of Scripture, and particularly by\nPaul, when he says that the ministers of the gospel have received a\ncommission to reconcile men to God,[866] and that they have authority to\ninflict punishment on those who shall reject this favour.[867]\nIV. How grossly they pervert those passages which make mention of\nbinding and loosing, I have hinted before, and shall hereafter have to\nstate more at large. At present it is worth while to see what they can\nextract from that celebrated answer of Christ to Peter. He promised him\n“the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” He said, “Whatsoever thou shalt\nbind on earth, shall be bound in heaven.”[868] If we can agree\nrespecting the word _keys_, and the manner of _binding_, all dispute\nwill immediately cease. For the pope himself will readily relinquish the\ncharge committed to the apostles, which, being full of labour and\ntrouble, would deprive him of his pleasures without yielding him any\nprofit. Since it is the doctrine of the gospel that opens heaven to us,\nit is beautifully expressed by the metaphorical appellation of\n_keys_.—There is no other way in which men are _bound_ and _loosed_,\nthan when some are reconciled to God by faith, and others are more\nfirmly bound by their unbelief. If the pope assumed nothing but this to\nhimself, I am persuaded there is no man who would either envy him or\ncontend with him.—But this succession being laborious, and by no means\nlucrative, and, therefore, not at all satisfactory to the pope, hence\narises a controversy on the meaning of Christ’s promise to Peter.\nTherefore I infer from the subject itself, that it only denotes the\ndignity of the apostolic office, which cannot be separated from the\nburden of it. For if the definition which I have given be admitted,—and\nit cannot without the greatest effrontery be rejected,—then here is\nnothing given to Peter that was not also common to his colleagues;\nbecause otherwise there would not only be a personal injury done to\nthem, but the majesty of the doctrine would be diminished. This our\nadversaries strenuously oppose. But what does it avail them to strike\nupon this rock? For they can never prove, but that as the preaching of\nthe same gospel was enjoined upon all the apostles, so they were all\nequally armed with the power of binding and loosing. They allege that\nChrist, when he promised to give the keys to Peter, constituted him head\nof the universal Church. But what he there promised to one, he in\nanother passage confers upon all the rest together, and delivers it, as\nit were, into their hands.[869] If the same power, which had been\npromised to one, was granted to all, in what respect is he superior to\nhis colleagues? His preëminence, they say, consists in this—that he\nreceives separately by himself, as well as in common with them, that\nwhich is only given to the others in common. What if I reply, with\nCyprian and Augustine, that Christ did this, not to prefer one man\nbefore others, but to display the unity of the Church? For this is the\nlanguage of Cyprian: “That in the person of one man God gave the keys to\nthem all, to signify the unity of them all; that, therefore, the rest\nwere, the same as Peter, endued with an equal participation both of\nhonour and of power; but that Christ commences with one, to show that\nthe Church is one.” Augustine says, “If there had not been in Peter a\nmysterious representation of the Church, the Lord would not have said to\nhim, I will give thee the keys; for if this was said to Peter alone, the\nChurch possesses them not; but if the Church has the keys, Peter, when\nhe received them, must have represented the whole Church.” And in\nanother place: “When a question was put to them all, Peter alone\nanswers, Thou art the Christ; and to him Christ says, I will give thee\nthe keys, as if the power of binding and loosing had been conferred upon\nhim alone; whereas he made that answer on behalf of all, and received\nthis power in common with all, as sustaining the character of unity. He\nis mentioned, therefore, one for all, because there is unity in all.”\nV. But this declaration, “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will\nbuild my Church,”[870] they say, is no where to be found addressed to\nany other. As if in this passage Christ affirmed any thing respecting\nPeter, different from what Paul, and even Peter himself, asserts,\nrespecting all Christians. For Paul makes “Christ the chief\ncorner-stone,” upon which they are built who “grow unto a holy temple in\nthe Lord.”[871] And Peter enjoins us to be “as lively stones,” who,\nbeing founded on that “corner-stone, elect and precious,”[872] are by\nthis connection at once united to our God and to each other. This\nbelongs to Peter, they say, above the rest, because it is expressly\nattributed to him in particular. I readily allow Peter the honour of\nbeing placed among the first in the structure of the Church, or, if they\ninsist upon it, the very first of all the faithful; but I will not\npermit them to infer from this that he possessed a primacy over the\nrest. For what kind of reasoning is this: he excels the rest in ardour\nof zeal, in doctrine, in magnanimity; therefore he possesses authority\nover them? As though we might not with greater plausibility conclude\nthat Andrew was superior to Peter, because he preceded him in time, and\nintroduced him to Christ;[873] but this I pass over. I am willing that\nPeter should have the precedence, but there is a great difference\nbetween the honour of preceding others, and authority over them. We see\nthat the apostles generally paid this deference to Peter, that he used\nto speak first in their assembly, and took the lead in proposing,\nexhorting, and admonishing; but we read not a word of his power.\nVI. We are not yet, however, come to that question; I only mean at\npresent to show, that they have no solid argument, when they wish to\nerect an empire over the universal church upon no other foundation than\nthe name of Peter. For those antiquated fooleries with which they\nendeavoured at first to impose on the world, are not worthy of a\nrelation, much less of a refutation—that the Church was founded on\nPeter, because it is said, “Upon this rock I will build my Church.”[874]\nThey allege in their defence, that it has been so explained by some of\nthe fathers. But when this is contradicted by the whole tenor of\nScripture, what avails it to set up their authority in opposition to\nGod? And why do we dispute about the meaning of those words, as though\nthey were ambiguous or obscure? whereas nothing can be expressed with\ngreater clearness or precision. Peter, in his own name and that of his\nbrethren, had confessed that Christ was “the Son of God.”[875] Upon this\nrock Christ builds his Church, because it is the only foundation, as\nPaul says, “other” than which “can no man lay.”[876] Nor do I reject the\nauthority of the fathers in this case, from a want of testimonies in\ntheir writings to support what I maintain, if I were inclined to adduce\nthem. But as I have observed, I am unwilling to be unnecessarily tedious\nto my readers in arguing so clear a subject; especially as it has been\nlong ago discussed with sufficient copiousness and care by other writers\non our side of the question.\nVII. Yet, in fact, we can obtain no better decision of this point than\nfrom the Scripture itself, if we compare all the places where it shows\nwhat office and power Peter held among the apostles, how he conducted\nhimself, and in what manner he was received by them. On an examination\nof the whole, we shall only find that he was one of the twelve, equal to\nthe rest, their companion, not their master. He proposes to the assembly\nindeed, if there be any thing to be done, and delivers his opinion on\nwhat is necessary to be done; but he hears the observations of others,\nand not only gives them the opportunity of speaking their sentiments,\nbut leaves them to decide, and when they have determined, he follows and\nobeys.[877] When he writes to pastors, he does not command them with\nauthority like a superior; but makes them his colleagues, and exhorts\nthem with a courteousness which is usual among equals.[878] When he is\naccused for having associated with the Gentiles, though this is an\nunjust accusation, yet he answers it, and vindicates himself.[879]\nCommanded by his colleagues to go with John to Samaria, he refuses\nnot.[880] The apostles, by sending him, declared that they did not\nconsider him as their superior. By his compliance and undertaking the\ncommission intrusted to him, he confessed that he was a colleague with\nthem, but had no authority over them. If none of these facts had\nremained upon record, yet the Epistle to the Galatians might alone\neasily remove every doubt; where Paul devotes nearly two whole chapters\nto the sole purpose of showing that he was equal to Peter in the dignity\nof the apostleship. Hence he relates that he went to Peter, not to\nprofess subjection to him, but to testify to all the harmony of their\ndoctrine; and that Peter required no such thing as submission, but gave\nhim the right hand of fellowship, that they might labour together in the\nvineyard of the Lord; that no less grace had been conferred upon him\namong the Gentiles, than upon Peter among the Jews; and lastly, that\nwhen Peter acted with some degree of unfaithfulness, he was reproved by\nhim, and stood corrected by the reproof.[881] All these things fully\nprove, either that there was an equality between Paul and Peter, or at\nleast that Peter had no more power over the rest than they had over him.\nAnd this, as I have already observed, is the professed object of Paul—to\nprevent his being considered as inferior in his apostolic character to\nPeter or John, who were his colleagues, not his masters.\nVIII. But though I grant them what they require respecting Peter, by\nadmitting that he was the chief of the apostles, and superior in dignity\nto all the others, yet there is no reason why they should convert a\nparticular instance into a universal rule, and make what was done but\nonce a perpetual precedent; for the cases are widely different. There\nwas one chief among the apostles; doubtless because they were few in\nnumber. If there be one president over twelve men, will it therefore\nfollow that there ought to be but one president over a hundred thousand\nmen? That twelve should have one among them to preside over the rest, is\nno wonder. For this is consistent with nature, and the common sense of\nmankind requires, that in every assembly, even though they are all equal\nin power, yet there should be one to act as moderator, by whom the\nothers should be regulated. There is no court, council, parliament, or\nassembly of any description, which has not its president or chairman. So\nthere would be no absurdity, if we acknowledged that the apostles gave\nthis preëminence to Peter. But that which obtains among a small company\nis not immediately to be applied to the whole world, to the government\nof which no one man is sufficient. But the whole economy of nature, they\nsay, teaches us, that there ought to be one supreme head over all. And\nin proof of this they adduce the example of cranes and bees, which\nalways choose for themselves one leader, and no more. I admit the\nexamples which they produce; but do bees collect together from all parts\nof the world to choose one king? Each king is content with his own hive.\nSo, among cranes, every flock has its own leader. What will they prove\nfrom this, but that every Church ought to have its own bishop? Next they\ncall us to consider examples from civil governments. They quote an\nobservation from Homer, that it is not good to have many governors, with\nsimilar passages of other profane writers in commendation of monarchy.\nThe answer is easy; for monarchy is not praised by Ulysses in Homer, or\nby any others, from an opinion that one king ought to govern the whole\nworld. Their meaning is, that one kingdom does not admit of two kings,\nand that no prince can bear a partner in his throne.\nIX. But supposing it to be, as they contend, good and useful that the\nwhole world should be comprehended in one monarchy, which, however, is a\nmonstrous absurdity; but if this were admitted, I should not, therefore,\ngrant the same system to be applicable to the government of the Church.\nFor the Church has Christ for its sole Head, under whose sovereignty we\nare all united together, according to that order and form of government\nwhich he himself has prescribed. They offer a gross insult to Christ,\ntherefore, when they assign the preëminence over the universal Church to\none man, under the pretence that it may not be destitute of a head. For\n“Christ is the head; from whom the whole body, fitly joined together,\nand compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the\neffectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the\nbody.”[882] We see how he places all men, without exception, in the\n_body_, reserving to Christ alone the honour and name of _head_. We see\nhow he assigns to all the members respectively a certain measure, and a\ndeterminate and limited function; so that the perfection of grace, as\nwell as the supreme power of government, resides in Christ alone. I am\naware of their usual cavil in evasion of this argument—that Christ is\nproperly styled the sole Head, because he alone governs by his own\nauthority and in his own name, but that this is no reason why there may\nnot be under him another _ministerial head_, as their phrase is, to act\nas his vicegerent on earth. But they gain nothing by this cavil, except\nthey first prove that this ministry was ordained by Christ. For the\napostle teaches, that all the subordinate ministration is distributed\namong the members, but that the power proceeds from that one heavenly\nHead.[883] Or, if they wish me to speak in plainer terms, since the\nScripture declares Christ to be the Head, and ascribes this honour to\nhim alone, it ought not to be transferred to any other, except to one\nwhom Christ himself has appointed his representative. But such an\nappointment is not only nowhere to be found, but may be abundantly\nrefuted by various passages.\nX. Paul gives us a lively description of the church on various\noccasions, but without making any mention of its having one head upon\nearth. On the contrary, from the description which he gives, we may\nrather infer that such a notion is foreign from the institution of\nChrist. Christ, at his ascension, withdrew from us his visible presence;\nnevertheless “he ascended that he might fill all things.”[884] He is\nstill, therefore, present, and will always continue present with the\nChurch. With a view to show us the manner in which he manifests himself,\nPaul calls our attention to the offices which he employs. There is “one\nLord,” he says, “in you all. But unto every one of us is given grace\naccording to the measure of the gift of Christ. And he gave some,\napostles; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.”[885]\nWhy does he not say, that he has appointed one to preside over all as\nhis vicegerent? For his subject absolutely required it, and it ought by\nno means to have been omitted, if it had been true. “Christ,” he says,\n“is present with us.” How? “By the ministry of men whom he has appointed\nto the government of the Church.” Why not rather, “By the ministerial\nhead, to whom he has delegated his authority?” He mentions a unity; but\nit is in God, and in the faith of Christ. He attributes nothing to men\nbut a common ministry, and to every individual his particular share. In\nthat commendation of unity, after having said, “There is one body, one\nSpirit, one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one\nbaptism,”[886] why has he not likewise immediately added, “one supreme\npontiff to preserve the Church in unity?” For if it had been true,\nnothing could have been more proper. Let that passage be duly\nconsidered. There is no doubt that he intends there a representation of\nthe sacred and spiritual government of the Church, which has since\nreceived the name of _hierarchy_. Monarchy among ministers, or the\ngovernment of one over all the rest, he not only does not mention, but\nindicates that there is no such thing. There is no doubt also that he\nmeant to express the nature of the union, by which the faithful are\nconnected with Christ their Head. Now, he not only makes no mention of\nany ministerial head, but attributes to every one of the members a\nparticular operation, according to the measure of grace distributed to\neach. Nor is there any foundation for their far-fetched argument from a\ncomparison of the heavenly and earthly hierarchy; for, in judging of the\nformer, it is not safe to go beyond the discoveries of the Scripture,\nand in constituting the latter, it is not right to follow any other\nmodel than that which the Lord himself has delineated in his word.\nXI. Now, though I should make them another concession, which they will\nnever obtain from judicious persons, that the primacy of the Church was\nestablished in Peter, and to be continued by a perpetual succession, how\nwill they prove that its seat was fixed at Rome, so that whoever is\nbishop of that city must preside over the whole world? By what right do\nthey restrict to one place this dignity, which was conferred without the\nmention of any place? Peter, they say, lived and died at Rome. What\nshall we say of Christ himself? Was it not at Jerusalem that he\nexercised the office of a bishop while he lived, and fulfilled the\npriestly office by his death? The Prince of pastors, the supreme Bishop,\nthe Head of the Church, could not obtain this honour for the place where\nhe lived and died; how then could Peter, who was far inferior to him?\nAre not these follies worse than puerile? Christ gave the honour of\nprimacy to Peter; Peter settled at Rome; therefore he fixed the seat of\nthe primacy in that city. For the same reason the ancient Israelites\nought to have fixed the seat of their primacy in the desert, because it\nwas there that Moses, their chief teacher, and the prince of their\nprophets, exercised his ministry, and died.\nXII. Let us see how wretchedly they reason. Peter, they say, had the\npreëminence among the apostles. Therefore, the Church in which he\nsettled ought to have this privilege. But where was he first stationed?\nThey reply, at Antioch. Then I infer that the Church of Antioch is\njustly entitled to the primacy. They confess that it was originally the\nfirst, but allege that Peter, on his removal from it, transferred the\nhonour which was attached to him to Rome. For there is an epistle of\nPope Marcellus to the presbyters of Antioch, in which he says, “The see\nof Peter was at first among you, but at the command of the Lord was\nafterwards removed to this city.” So the Church of Antioch, which was\noriginally the first, has given place to the see of Rome. But I ask, By\nwhat oracle did that wise pope know that the Lord had commanded this?\nFor if this cause is to be decided on the footing of right, it is\nnecessary for them to answer, whether this privilege be personal, or\nreal, or mixed. It must be one of these. If they affirm it to be\npersonal, then it has nothing to do with the place. If they allege it to\nbe real, then when it has once been given to a place, it cannot be taken\naway from it by the death or removal of the person. It remains,\ntherefore, for them to declare it to be mixed; and then it will not be\nsufficiently simple to consider the place, unless there be an agreement\nalso with respect to the person. Let them choose which they will, I\nshall immediately conclude, and will easily prove, that the assumption\nof the primacy by the see of Rome is without any foundation.\nXIII. Let us suppose the case, however, that the primacy was, as they\npretend, transferred from Antioch to Rome. Why did not Antioch retain\nthe second place? For, if Rome has the preëminence of all other sees,\nbecause Peter presided there till the close of his life, to what city\nshall the second place be assigned, but to that which was his first see?\nHow came Alexandria, then, to have the precedence of Antioch? Is it\nreasonable that the Church of a mere disciple should be superior to the\nsee of Peter? If honour be due to every Church according to the dignity\nof its founder, what shall we say of the other Churches? Paul mentions\nthree apostles, “who seemed to be pillars, James, Peter, and John.”[887]\nIf the first place be given to the see of Rome, in honour of Peter, are\nnot the second and third places due to Ephesus and Jerusalem, the sees\nof John and James? But among the patriarchates, Jerusalem had the last\nplace; Ephesus could not be allowed even the farthest corner. Other\nChurches also, as well those which were founded by Paul, as those over\nwhich the other apostles presided, were left without any distinction.\nThe see of Mark, who was only one of the disciples, obtained the honour.\nEither let them confess that this was a preposterous arrangement, or let\nthem concede to us, that it is not a perpetual rule, that every Church\nshould be entitled to the degree of honour which was enjoyed by its\nfounder.\nXIV. All that they say of the settlement of Peter in the Church of Rome\nappears to me of very questionable authority. The statement of Eusebius,\nthat he presided there twenty-five years, may be refuted without any\ndifficulty. For it appears, from the first and second chapter to the\nGalatians, that about twenty years after the death of Christ, he was at\nJerusalem, and that from thence he went to Antioch, where he remained\nfor some time, but it is not certain how long. Gregory says seven years,\nand Eusebius twenty-five. But from the death of Christ to the end of the\nreign of Nero, under whom they affirm Peter to have been slain, there\nwere only thirty-seven years. For our Lord suffered in the eighteenth\nyear of the reign of Tiberius. If we deduct twenty years, during which,\naccording to the testimony of Paul, Peter dwelt at Jerusalem, there will\nremain only seventeen years, which must now be divided between those two\nbishoprics. If he continued long at Antioch, he could not have resided\nat Rome, except for a very short time. This point is susceptible of\nstill clearer proof. Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans on a journey\nwhen he was going to Jerusalem,[888] where he was seized, and from\nwhence he was sent to Rome. It is probable, therefore, that this Epistle\nwas written four years before his arrival at Rome. Yet it contains no\nmention of Peter; which ought on no account to have been omitted, if he\nhad presided over that Church. And in the conclusion, where he recites a\nlong catalogue of pious persons to whom he sends his salutations, where,\nin short, he enumerates all that were known to him, he still says not a\nword of Peter.[889] It is unnecessary to use any long or laboured\narguments with persons of sound judgment; for the case itself, and the\nwhole argument of the Epistle proclaims, that if Peter had been at Rome,\nhe ought not to have been omitted.\nXV. Paul was afterwards brought as a prisoner to Rome. Luke says that he\nwas received by the brethren, but says nothing of Peter.[890] From that\ncity Paul wrote to several Churches. In some of these epistles he\nintroduces salutations, in the names of certain brethren who were with\nhim; but they contain not a single word implying that Peter was there at\nthat time. Who will think it credible that, if he had been there, Paul\ncould have passed him over in total silence? Moreover, in his Epistle to\nthe Philippians, after having said that he had no one who discovered\nsuch sincere concern respecting the work of the Lord as Timothy, he\ncomplains that “all seek their own.”[891] And to Timothy himself he\nmakes yet a heavier complaint: “At my first answer no man stood with me,\nbut all men forsook me.”[892] Where was Peter then? For if they say that\nhe was at Rome, how deep is the ignominy which Paul fixes upon him, that\nhe was a deserter of the gospel? For he is speaking of the faithful,\nbecause he adds his prayer, “that it may not be laid to their charge.”\nHow long, then, and at what time, did Peter hold that see? It will be\nsaid, it is the uniform opinion of ancient writers, that he governed\nthat Church till his death. But those writers themselves are not agreed\nwho was his successor. Some say it was Linus; and others, Clement. They\nlikewise relate many absurd and fabulous stories respecting the\ndisputation held between him and Simon Magus. And Augustine, when\ntreating of superstitions, acknowledges that the custom, which obtained\nat Rome, of not fasting on the day on which Peter gained the victory\nover Simon Magus, arose from an opinion entertained without any\nsufficient authority. In the last place, the transactions of that age\nare so perplexed by a variety of representations, that we must not give\nimplicit credit to every thing that is recorded. Yet, in consequence of\nthis agreement of the ancient writers, I will not dispute his having\ndied at Rome; but that he was bishop there, and especially for any\nconsiderable time, is what I cannot be persuaded to believe. Nor am I\nanxious respecting this point, because Paul testifies that the\napostleship of Peter particularly belonged to the Jews, and that his own\nwas directed to us. To add our confirmation, therefore, to the compact\nwhich they established between themselves, or rather to admit the\nvalidity of the ordinance of the Holy Spirit, it becomes us rather to\nlook up to the apostleship of Paul than to that of Peter. For their\ndifferent provinces were allotted to them by the Holy Spirit, who sent\nPeter to the Jews, and Paul to us. The Romanists, therefore, may seek\nfor their primacy elsewhere, but not in the word of God, which affords\nnot the least foundation for it.\nXVI. Let us now proceed to show, that our adversaries have no more\nreason for boasting of the authority of the ancient Church than of the\ntestimony of the word of God. For when they bring forward this\nprinciple, that the unity of the Church cannot be preserved, unless it\nhave one supreme head upon earth, to whom all the members should be\nsubject, and that, therefore, the Lord gave the primacy to Peter, and\nafterwards by right of succession, to the see of Rome, that it might\nremain there to the end of time,—they also assert that this has been the\nusage from the beginning. Now, as they grossly pervert various\ntestimonies, I would first make this preliminary remark. I do not deny\nthat the ancient writers uniformly give great honour to the Roman\nChurch, and speak of it in respectful terms. This I consider as arising\nprincipally from three causes. In the first place, that opinion which, I\nknow not how, had been received, that it had been founded and settled by\nthe ministry of Peter, operated very powerfully to gain it credit and\nauthority, and, therefore, among the Western churches it was called _the\nApostolic See_. In the second place, because it was the capital of the\nempire; and on this account it is probable that it contained men\nsuperior in learning and prudence, skill and experience, to those of any\nother place; due regard was paid to this circumstance, that the glory of\nthe city and other far more excellent gifts of God might not appear to\nbe undervalued. In the third place, while the Eastern and Greek\nChurches, and even those in Africa, were agitated by numerous\ndissensions of opinion among themselves, the Church of Rome was more\npeaceable and less disturbed. Hence it happened, that pious and holy\nbishops, on being expelled from their sees, frequently resorted thither,\nas to an asylum or port of safety. For as the people of Europe have less\nsubtlety and activity of mind than the inhabitants of Asia and Africa,\nso they are not so volatile or desirous of novelty. It considerably\nincreased the authority of the Church of Rome, therefore, that in those\nuncertain times it was not so much agitated as the other Churches, and\nwas more tenacious of the doctrine which it had once received than all\nthe rest, as we shall presently show more at large. On account of these\nthree causes, I say, it was held in more than common respect, and\nreceived many honourable testimonies from ancient writers.\nXVII. But when our adversaries wish to make this a reason for ascribing\nto that Church the primacy and sovereign power over other Churches, they\nrun, as I have already observed, into a gross error. To make this the\nmore evident, I will first briefly show what the ancient writers thought\nrespecting this unity, on which our opponents so urgently insist.\nJerome, writing to Nepotian, after having enumerated many examples of\nunity, at length descends to the hierarchy of the Church. “Every\nChurch,” he says, “has its distinct bishop, archpresbyter, and\narchdeacon, and all the order of the Church depends upon its governors.”\nThis is the language of a Roman priest, recommending unity in the order\nof the Church. Why does he not mention that all Churches are connected\ntogether under one head, as by a common bond? Nothing would have been\nmore in favour of his argument; nor can it be pretended that he omitted\nit for want of recollection; he would most readily have mentioned it, if\nthe fact had permitted him. It is beyond all doubt, therefore, that he\nsaw this to be the true kind of unity, which is most excellently\ndescribed by Cyprian in the following passage: “There is only one\nbishopric, of which every bishop holds an integral part; and there is\nbut one Church, which is widely extended into a multitude by the\noffspring of its fertility. As the sun has many rays, but only one\nlight; as a tree has many branches, but only one trunk, fixed on a firm\nroot; and as many rivers issue from one spring, and notwithstanding the\nnumber of the streams in which its overflowing abundance is diffused,\nyet the unity of the source remains the same;—so also the Church,\nilluminated with the light of the Lord, extends its rays over the whole\nearth, yet it is one and the same light which is universally diffused,\nnor is the unity of the body destroyed. It stretches its branches, it\npours out its ample streams, all over the world; yet there is but one\nroot, and one source.” Again: “The spouse of Christ cannot be corrupted;\nshe acknowledges one Master, and preserves her fidelity to him\ninviolate.” We see how he attributes the universal bishopric, which\ncomprehends the whole Church, to Christ alone, and says that integral\nportions of it are confided to all those who discharge the episcopal\noffice under this head. Where is the primacy of the see of Rome, if the\nuniversal bishopric be vested in Christ alone, and every bishop hold an\nintegral portion of it? My object, in these quotations, has been, to\nconvince the reader, by the way, that this principle, which the\nRomanists assume as an admitted and indubitable maxim, namely, that the\nunity of the Church requires the supremacy of some earthly head, was\naltogether unknown to the ancients.\nFootnote 862:\nMatt. xvi. 18.\nFootnote 863:\nJohn xxi. 16.\nFootnote 864:\n1 Peter v. 2.\nFootnote 865:\nJohn xx. 23.\nFootnote 866:\n2 Cor. v. 18.\nFootnote 867:\n2 Cor. x. 6.\nFootnote 868:\nMatt. xvi. 19.\nFootnote 869:\nMatt. xviii. 18.

          "content": "THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE PAPAL POWER TO ITS PRESENT EMINENCE,\nATTENDED WITH THE LOSS OF LIBERTY TO THE CHURCH, AND THE RUIN OF ALL\nMODERATION.\nIn support of the antiquity of the primacy of the see of Rome, there is\nnothing to be found anterior to the decree of the Council of Nice, by\nwhich the bishop of Rome is allotted the first place among the\npatriarchs, and is directed to superintend the neighbouring Churches.\nWhen the council makes a distinction between him and the other\npatriarchs, so as to assign to all their respective limits, it clearly\ndoes not constitute him the head of them all, but only makes him one of\nthe principal. Vitus and Vincentius attended the council on the behalf\nof Julius, who at that time presided over the Church of Rome. They were\nseated in the fourth place. If Julius had been acknowledged as the head\nof the Church, would his representatives have been degraded to the\nfourth seat? Would Athanasius have presided in a general council, where\nthe form of the hierarchical system ought most particularly to have been\nobserved? In the council of Ephesus, it appears that Celestine, who was\nthen bishop of Rome, made use of a disingenuous artifice to secure the\ndignity of his see. For when he sent his legates thither, he requested\nCyril, patriarch of Alexandria, who was otherwise to preside, to act on\nhis behalf. For what purpose could this request be made, but that his\nname might, at any rate, occupy the first place? For his legates sat in\na lower station, were asked their sentiments among others, and\nsubscribed in their order; at the same time the patriarch of Alexandria\nunited Celestine’s name with his own. What shall I say of the second\nCouncil of Ephesus, where, though the legates of Leo were present, yet\nDioscorus, patriarch of Alexandria, presided as in his own right? They\nwill object, that this was not an orthodox council, because it condemned\nFlavianus, a holy man, bishop of Constantinople, and acquitted Eutyches,\nand sanctioned his heresy. But when the council was assembled, and the\nbishops took their respective seats, it is certain that the legates of\nthe Roman Church were present among the others, as in a holy and\nlegitimate council. Yet they contended not for the first place, but\nyielded it to another, which they would not have done if they had\nconsidered it as belonging to them. For the bishops of Rome have never\nbeen ashamed of raising the greatest contentions for their dignity, and\nthey have not hesitated, on this account alone, to harass and agitate\nthe Church with various and pernicious controversies. But because Leo\nsaw that it would be too presumptuous a demand to require the first\nplace for his legates, therefore he waived it.\nII. Next follows the Council of Chalcedon, in which, by the permission\nof the emperor, the legates of the Roman Church occupied the first\nplace. But Leo himself confessed that this was an extraordinary\nprivilege. For when he requested it from Marcian the emperor, and\nPulcheria the empress, he did not pretend it to be his right, but only\nalleged, in support of his claim, that the Eastern bishops who presided\nin the Council of Ephesus had thrown every thing into confusion, and\nabused their power. Since it was necessary, therefore, to have a\ndiscreet moderator, and it was improbable that those who had once been\nso unsteady and disorderly would be fit for the office, he requested\nthat, on account of the misconduct and incompetence of the others, the\ntask of presiding should be transferred to him. That which is sought as\na special privilege and an exception to a common custom, certainly does\nnot arise from a general rule. Where the only pretext is, that it was\nnecessary to have a new president, because the former ones had violated\ntheir duty, it is evident that this had not been the case before, and it\nought not to be perpetual, but was merely done in the contemplation of\npresent danger. The bishop of Rome, therefore, had the first place in\nthe Council of Chalcedon, not because it was the right of his see, but\nbecause the council was in want of a discreet and suitable president, in\nconsequence of those to whom that honour belonged having excluded\nthemselves from it by their own intemperance and violence. And what I\nsay was proved, in fact, by Leo’s successor. For when he sent his\nlegates to the fifth Council of Constantinople, which was held a\nconsiderable time after, he contended not for the first seat, but\nwithout any difficulty suffered it to be taken by Menna, patriarch of\nConstantinople. So in the Council of Carthage, at which Augustine was\npresent, the place of president was filled by Aurelius, archbishop of\nthat city, and not by the legates of the Roman see, though the express\nobject of their attendance was to support the authority of the Roman\npontiff. And, moreover, there was a general council held in Italy, at\nwhich the bishop of Rome was not present. This was the Council of\nAquileia, at which Ambrose presided, who was then in high credit with\nthe emperor. There was no mention made of the bishop of Rome. We see,\ntherefore, that the dignity of Ambrose caused the see of Milan at that\ntime to have the precedence above that of Rome.\nIII. With respect to the title of primacy, and other titles of pride, of\nwhich the pope now strangely boasts, it is not difficult to judge when\nand in what manner they were introduced. Cyprian, bishop of Carthage,\nmakes frequent mention of Cornelius, who was bishop of Rome. He\ndistinguishes him by no other appellation than that of _brother_, or\n_fellow bishop_, or _colleague_. But when he writes to Stephen, the\nsuccessor of Cornelius, he not only treats him as equal to himself and\nothers, but even addresses him with considerable severity, charging him\nat one time with arrogance, and at another with ignorance. Since the\ntime of Cyprian, we know what was the decision of the whole African\nChurch on this subject. For the Council of Carthage prohibited that any\none should be called “the prince of priests,” or “the first bishop,” but\nonly “the bishop of the first see.” But any one who examines the more\nancient records, will find that at that time the bishop of Rome was\ncontent with the common appellation of _brother_. It is certain that as\nlong as the Church retained its true and uncorrupted form, all those\nnames of pride, which in succeeding times have been insolently usurped\nby the Roman see, were altogether unknown: nothing was heard of a\nsupreme pontiff or a sole head of the Church upon earth. And if the\nbishop of Rome had been presumptuous enough to make any such assumption,\nthere were judicious men who would immediately have repressed his folly.\nJerome, being a Roman presbyter, was not reluctant to assert the dignity\nof his Church as far as matter of fact and the state of the times\nadmitted; yet we see how he also reduces it to an equality with others.\n“If it be a question of authority,” he says, “the world is greater than\na city. Why do you allege to me the custom of a single city? Why do you\nset up a few instances, which have given rise to pride, against the laws\nof the Church? Wherever there is a bishop, whether at Rome, at Eugubium,\nat Constantinople, or at Rhegium, he is of the same dignity and of the\nsame priesthood. The power of riches, or the abasement of poverty, makes\nno bishop superior or inferior to another.”\nIV. Respecting the title of _universal bishop_, the first contention\narose in the time of Gregory, and was occasioned by the ambition of\nJohn, bishop of Constantinople. For he wanted to make himself universal\nbishop—an attempt which had never been made by any one before. In that\ncontroversy Gregory does not plead against this as the assumption of a\nright which belonged to himself, but resolutely protests against it\naltogether, as a profane and sacrilegious application, and even as the\nforerunner of Antichrist. He says, “If he who is called _universal_\nfalls, the foundation of the whole Church sinks at once.” In another\nplace: “It is a most melancholy thing to hear with any patience, that\nour brother and companion in the episcopal office should look down with\ncontempt on all others, and be called _sole bishop_. But what does this\npride of his indicate, but that the times of Antichrist are already at\nhand? For indeed he imitates him, who, despising the society of angels,\nendeavoured to usurp supreme power to himself.” In another place,\nwriting to Eulogius, bishop of Alexandria, and Anastasius, bishop of\nAntioch, he says, “None of my predecessors would ever use this profane\nword. For if one patriarch be called _universal_, the name of patriarch\nis taken away from all the rest. But far be it from any Christian heart\nto wish to arrogate to himself any thing that would in the least degree\ndiminish the honour of his brethren. To consent to that execrable term\nis no other than to destroy the faith. Our obligation to preserve the\nunity of the faith is one thing, and to repress the haughtiness of pride\nis another. But I confidently assert, that whoever calls himself\n_universal bishop_, or desires to be so called, in such aggrandizement\nis the precursor of Antichrist, because he proudly sets up himself above\nall others.” Again, to Anastasius, bishop of Antioch: “I have said that\nthe bishop of Constantinople can have no peace with us, unless he would\ncorrect the haughtiness of that superstitious and proud title which has\nbeen invented by the first apostate; and to say nothing of the injury\ndone to your dignity, if one bishop be called _universal_, when he\nfalls, the whole Church sinks at once.” But his assertion that this\nhonour was offered to Leo in the Council of Chalcedon has not the least\nappearance of truth. For there is not a word of this in the acts of that\ncouncil. And Leo himself, who in many of his epistles censures the\ndecree passed there in favour of the see of Constantinople, would\ncertainly not have passed over this argument, which would have been the\nmost plausible of all, if that honour had really been offered to him,\nand he had refused it; and, having otherwise an immoderate thirst for\nhonour, he would not readily have omitted a circumstance so much to his\npraise. Gregory was mistaken, therefore, in supposing that title to have\nbeen given to the see of Rome by the Council of Chalcedon. I forbear to\nremark how ridiculous it is for him to assert that the holy council\nconferred such a title, which he at the same time declares was profane,\nexecrable, abominable, proud, and sacrilegious, and even invented by the\ndevil, and published by the herald of Antichrist. And yet he adds that\nhis predecessor refused it, lest, by the dignity given to one\nindividual, all other bishops should be deprived of the honour due to\nthem. In another place he says, “No one has ever wished to be called by\nsuch a name; no one has arrogated to himself this presumptuous title;\nlest, by assuming to himself the exclusive dignity of supreme bishop, he\nmight seem to deny the episcopal honour to all his brethren.”\nV. I come now to the jurisdiction which the Roman pontiff asserts that\nhe indisputably holds over all churches. I know what violent contentions\nthere were in ancient times on this subject. For there has never been a\nperiod when the Roman see did not aspire to some authority over other\nChurches. And it will not be unsuitable to the present occasion to\ninvestigate the means by which it gradually rose to some power. I am not\nyet speaking of that unbounded empire which it has more recently\nusurped; that I shall defer to its proper place. But here it will be\nnecessary to point out in a few words in what manner and by what methods\nit formerly exalted itself, so as to assume any jurisdiction over other\nChurches. When the Eastern Churches were disturbed and divided by the\nfactions of the Arians, in the reign of Constantius and Constans, sons\nof Constantine the Great, and Athanasius, the principal defender of the\northodox faith, was driven from his see, that calamity constrained him\nto go to Rome, in order that, by the authority of the Roman see, he\nmight in some degree repress the rage of his enemies, and confirm the\nfaithful, who were in extreme distress. He was honourably received by\nJulius, then bishop of Rome, and prevailed on the bishops of the West to\nundertake the defence of his cause. Thus the pious in the Eastern\nChurches, finding themselves in great want of foreign aid, and seeing\nthat their principal succour was to be obtained from the Church of Rome,\nreadily ascribed to it all the authority that they possibly could. But\nall this amounted to nothing more than that communion with it was held\nin high estimation, and it was accounted ignominious to be\nexcommunicated from it. This dignity was afterwards considerably\naugmented by men of wicked and abandoned lives; for to escape the\npunishments which they deserved, they resorted thither as to a common\nasylum. Therefore, if a priest was condemned by his bishop, or a bishop\nby the synod of his province, they immediately appealed to Rome. And the\nbishops of Rome received such appeals with culpable eagerness,\nconsidering it as a kind of extraordinary power to interfere in the\nconcerns of distant Churches. Thus when Eutyches was condemned by\nFlavianus, patriarch of Constantinople, he complained to Leo that he had\nbeen treated with injustice. Leo, without any delay, but with equal\ntemerity and expedition, undertook the patronage of a bad cause, issued\nbitter invectives against Flavianus, as if he had condemned an innocent\nman without hearing his defence, and by this ambitious conduct he for\nsome time afforded considerable support to the impiety of Eutyches. It\nappears that similar circumstances frequently happened in Africa. For as\nsoon as any wicked man was convicted before the ordinary tribunal, he\nflew to Rome, and brought various false accusations against his\nsuperiors; and the see of Rome was always ready to interpose. This\npresumption constrained the African bishops to pass a decree that no one\nshould appeal beyond the sea on pain of excommunication.\nVI. But however this might be, let us examine what jurisdiction or power\nthe Roman see then possessed. Now, ecclesiastical power consists in\nthese four things—the ordination of bishops, the calling of councils,\nthe hearing of appeals, or jurisdiction, and corrective admonitions, or\ncensures. All the ancient councils command bishops to be ordained by\ntheir own metropolitans; and they never direct the bishop of Rome to be\ncalled to this office except in his own province. By degrees, however, a\ncustom was introduced for all the bishops of Italy to go to Rome to be\nconsecrated, except the metropolitans, who did not suffer themselves to\nbe subjected to this bondage. But when any metropolitan was to be\nordained, the bishop of Rome sent one of his priests to assist at the\nceremony, but not to preside. There is an example of this in an epistle\nof Gregory, respecting the consecration of Constantius, archbishop of\nMilan, after the death of Laurentius. I do not suppose, however, that\nthis was a very ancient practice. It is probable that at first they sent\nlegates to each other, from a principle of respect and affection, to\nwitness the ordination, and testify their mutual communion; and that\nwhat was originally voluntary, was afterwards considered as necessary.\nHowever this may be, it is evident that in ancient times the bishop of\nRome did not possess the power of consecrating bishops, except in his\nown province, that is, in the Churches dependent upon his see; as is\ndeclared by one of the canons of the Council of Nice. Consecration was\nfollowed by the sending of a synodical epistle; and in this the bishop\nof Rome had no superiority over others. It was the custom of the\npatriarchs, immediately after their consecration, to make a solemn\ndeclaration of their faith in a written communication to their brethren,\nprofessing their adherence to the doctrine of the holy and orthodox\ncouncils. Thus, by making a confession of their faith, they mutually\napproved themselves to each other. If the bishop of Rome had received\nsuch a confession from others, and not given it to other bishops in his\nturn, this would have been an instance of acknowledged superiority; but,\nas he was under the same obligation to give it as to require it, and was\nsubject to the common law, it was certainly a token of equality, and not\nof dominion. We have examples of this in the epistles of Gregory to\nAnastasius and Cyriacus of Constantinople, and to all the patriarchs\ntogether.\nVII. Next follow admonitions or censures, which, as the bishops of Rome\nformerly employed them towards others, they also received from others in\ntheir turn. Irenæus, bishop of Lyons, sharply reproved Victor, bishop of\nRome, for having raised a pernicious dissension in the Church on\nsubjects of no importance. Victor submitted to the reproof without any\nopposition. It was a liberty at that time commonly used by the holy\nbishops to exercise the privilege of brethren towards the bishop of\nRome, by admonishing and reproving him whenever he committed any fault.\nHe, in like manner, when occasion required, admonished others of their\nduty, and reproved them for their faults. For Cyprian, when he exhorts\nStephen, bishop of Rome, to admonish the bishops of France, argues not\nfrom any superior authority, but from the common rights which priests\nenjoy among each other. If Stephen had then possessed any authority over\nFrance, would not Cyprian have said, You should chastise them, because\nthey are subject to you? But he expresses himself in a very different\nmanner. “This fraternal union,” says he, “by which we are connected\ntogether, requires us to administer to each other mutual admonition.”\nAnd we see with what severity of language, though otherwise a man of a\nmild disposition, he censures even Stephen himself, when he considered\nhim assuming too much consequence. In this respect, also, there is yet\nno appearance of the bishop of Rome having been invested with any\njurisdiction over those who were not of his province.\nVIII. With respect to the calling of councils, it was the duty of every\nmetropolitan, at stated seasons, to summon a provincial synod. There the\nbishop of Rome had no authority. But a universal council could only be\ncalled by the emperor. For if any one of the bishops had attempted this,\nnot only he would not have been obeyed by those who were out of his\nprovince, but such an attempt would have led to immediate confusion.\nTherefore the emperor sent a summons to attend to all of them alike.\nSocrates, indeed, in his Ecclesiastical History, states that Julius,\nbishop of Rome, expostulated with the Eastern bishops, for not having\ninvited him to the Council of Antioch; whereas the canons had forbidden\nthat any thing should be decreed without the knowledge of the bishop of\nRome. But who does not see that this is to be understood of those\ndecrees which bind the universal Church? Now, it is no wonder if there\nwas so much respect paid to the antiquity and eminence of the city, and\nto the dignity of the see, as to determine that no general decree\nrespecting religion should be passed in the absence of the bishop of\nRome, unless he refused to be present. But what is this towards dominion\nover the whole Church? For we do not deny that the bishop of Rome was\none of the principal, but we will not admit, what the Romanists now\ncontend, that he had the authority over all.\nIX. There remains the fourth kind of ecclesiastical power, which\nconsists in appeals. It is evident that he possesses supreme authority,\nto whose tribunal appeals are made. Many often appealed to the bishop of\nRome; and he also attempted to assume the cognizance of causes; but he\nalways became an object of derision whenever he exceeded his proper\nlimits. I shall say nothing of the East, or of Greece; but it appears\nthat the bishops of France strenuously resisted him, when he discovered\nan inclination to usurp authority over them. In Africa, this subject\noccasioned a long controversy. For when the Council of Milevum, at which\nAugustine was present, had denounced excommunication against all who\nshould appeal beyond the sea, the bishop of Rome endeavoured to get this\ndecree rescinded. He sent legates to state that this privilege had been\ngiven to him by the Council of Nice. The legates produced certain acts\nwhich they alleged to be the acts of the Council of Nice, and which they\nhad brought from the archives of their Church. They were resisted by the\nAfricans, who denied that the bishop of Rome ought to be credited in his\nown cause. They therefore determined to send to Constantinople, and\nother cities of Greece, to obtain copies liable to less suspicion. It\nwas found that these copies contained no such passages as the Roman\nlegates had pretended. So the decree was confirmed, which had taken the\nsupreme cognizance of appeals from the bishop of Rome. This transaction\ndiscovered the scandalous impudence of the Roman pontiff. For when he\nhad fraudulently substituted the council of Sardis for that of Nice, he\nwas disgracefully detected in a manifest falsehood. But still greater\nwickedness and effrontery were betrayed by those who added to the acts\nof the council a forged epistle, in which a bishop of Carthage condemns\nthe arrogance of his predecessor, Aurelius, for having dared to withdraw\nhimself from obedience to the apostolic see, presents the submission of\nhimself and his Church, and humbly supplicates for pardon. These are the\nglorious monuments of antiquity upon which the majesty of the Roman see\nis founded; while, under the pretext of antiquity, they advance such\npuerile falsehoods, as require not the least penetration to detect.\n“Aurelius,” says this famous epistle, “elated with diabolical audacity\nand obstinacy, was a rebel against Christ and St. Peter, and therefore\ndeserved to be anathematized.” But what said Augustine? What said all\nthe fathers who were present at the Council of Milevum? But what\nnecessity is there for spending many words to refute that stupid\nfabrication, which even the Romanists themselves, if they have any\nmodesty left, cannot look at without being exceedingly ashamed? So\nGratian, the compiler of the decretal,—whether from wickedness or\nignorance I know not,—after having recited that canon, that those who\nappealed beyond the sea should be excommunicated, adds this exception,\nunless they appeal to the see of Rome. What can be done with such men,\nwho are so destitute of common sense as to make that one case an\nexception to a law, to guard against which every one sees that the law\nwas made? For the council, in condemning appeals beyond the sea, only\nprohibited any one from appealing to Rome; and this admirable expositor\nexcepts Rome from the general prohibition!\nX. But to put an end at once to this question, a single transaction,\nrelated by Augustine, will be sufficient to show what kind of\njurisdiction was anciently possessed by the bishop of Rome. Donatus,\nbishop of Casæ Nigræ, had accused Cæcilianus, bishop of Carthage. The\naccused was condemned without a hearing; for, knowing that the bishops\nhad conspired against him, he would not appear. The matter was then\nbrought before the Emperor Constantine. With a view to have the cause\ndecided by an ecclesiastical judgment, he referred the cognizance of it\nto Melchiades, bishop of Rome, with whom he associated some other\nbishops from Italy, France, and Spain. If it was part of the ordinary\njurisdiction of the see of Rome to hear an appeal in an ecclesiastical\ncause, why did Melchiades suffer any colleagues to be appointed with him\nat the pleasure of the Emperor? and, moreover, why did he himself\nundertake the business rather at the command of the Emperor than from\nhis own authority? But let us hear what took place afterwards.\nCæcilianus was victorious. Donatus of Casæ Nigræ was convicted of\ncalumny. He appealed. Constantine referred the appeal to the bishop of\nArles. He sat in judgment on the decision of the bishop of Rome. If the\nRoman see possessed the supreme jurisdiction, subject to no appeal, how\ndid Melchiades submit to such an insult, as for the bishop of Arles to\nbe preferred before him? And who was the Emperor that did this? It was\nConstantine the Great, of whom they boast that he not only devoted all\nhis attention, but employed almost all the power of his empire, to exalt\nthe dignity of their see. We see, then, how very far the bishop of Rome\nwas at that time from that supreme dominion which he pretends to have\nbeen given him by Christ over all Churches, and which he falsely boasts\nof having exercised in all ages with the consent of the whole world.\nXI. I know what numerous epistles, and rescripts, and edicts, there are,\nin which the pontiffs have confidently advanced the most extravagant\nclaims respecting this power. But it is also known to every person,\npossessed of the least sense or learning, that most things contained in\nthem are so extremely absurd, that it is easy to discover at the first\nglance from what source they have proceeded. For what man of sound\njudgment, and in his sober senses, can suppose that Anacletus was the\nauthor of that curious interpretation, which Gratian quotes under his\nname—that Cephas means a head? There are many such fooleries collected\ntogether by Gratian without any judgment, which the Romanists in the\npresent day employ against us in defence of their see; and such phantoms\nwith which they used to delude the ignorant in the darkest times, they\nstill persist in bringing forward amidst all the light of the present\nage. But I have no intention to devote much labour to the refutation of\nsuch things, which manifestly refute themselves by their extreme\nabsurdity. I confess that there are also genuine epistles of the ancient\npontiffs, in which they extol the majesty of their see by the most\nmagnificent titles. Such are some epistles of Leo; who, though he was a\nman of learning and eloquence, had likewise an immoderate thirst for\nglory and dominion; but whether the Churches at that time gave credit to\nhis testimony when he thus exalted himself, is a subject of inquiry.\nNow, it appears that many were offended at his ambition, and resisted\nhis claims. In one epistle he deputes the bishop of Thessalonica to act\nas his representative in Greece and other adjacent countries; in another\nhe delegates the bishop of Arles, or some other bishop, to be his vicar\nin France. So he appoints Hormisdas, bishop of Seville, his vicar in\nSpain. But in all cases he mentions, by way of exception, that he makes\nsuch appointments on condition that they shall in no respect infringe\nthe ancient privileges of the metropolitans. But Leo himself declares\nthis to be one of their privileges, that if any difficulty should arise,\nthe metropolitan was to be consulted in the first place. These\ndelegations, therefore, were accompanied with this condition—that there\nwas to be no interference with any bishop in his ordinary jurisdiction,\nwith any metropolitan in hearing appeals, or with any provincial synod\nin the regulation of the Churches. Now, what was this but to abstain\nfrom all jurisdiction, and only to interpose for the settlement of\ndisputes, as far as was consistent with the law and nature of\necclesiastical communion?\nXII. In the time of Gregory, this ancient custom had already undergone a\nconsiderable change. For when the empire was convulsed and torn asunder,\nwhen France and Spain were afflicted with repeated and numerous wars and\ndistresses, Illyricum laid waste, Italy harassed, and Africa almost\nruined with incessant calamities,—in order to preserve the unity of the\nfaith amidst such a violent convulsion of civil affairs, or at least to\nprevent its total destruction, all the bishops round about connected\nthemselves more closely with the bishop of Rome. The consequence was,\nthat the power as well as the dignity of that see was greatly increased.\nI am not much concerned, however, respecting the methods by which this\nwas effected. It is at least evident, that it was greater at that period\nthan in the preceding ages. And even then it was very far from an\nunlimited dominion, for one man to govern all others according to his\nown pleasure. But the see of Rome was held in such reverence, that its\nauthority would repress and correct the refractory and obstinate, who\ncould not be confined to their duty by the other bishops. For Gregory\nembraces every opportunity of protesting, that he as faithfully\nmaintained the rights of others, as he required them to maintain his.\n“Nor under the influence of ambition,” says he, “do I withhold from any\none that which is his right; but I desire to honour my brethren in all\nthings.”—There is not a sentence in his writings which contains a\nprouder boast of the majesty of his primacy than the following: “I know\nno bishop who is not subject to the apostolic see, when he is found in\nfault.” But he immediately adds, “Where there is no fault to require\nsubjection, all are equal by right of humility.” He attributes to\nhimself the authority to correct those who have transgressed; if all do\ntheir duty, he places himself on an equality with them. But he assumed\nthis authority to himself, and they who were willing consented to it,\nwhile others, who disapproved of it, were at liberty to oppose it with\nimpunity; and this, it is notorious, was the conduct of the majority.\nBesides, it is to be remarked, that he is there speaking of the primate\nof Constantinople, who had been condemned by a provincial synod, and had\ndisregarded the united judgment of the assembly. His colleagues\ncomplained to the emperor of his obstinacy. The emperor appointed\nGregory to decide the cause. We see, then, that he made no attempt to\ninterfere with the ordinary jurisdiction; and that the very thing which\nhe does for the assistance of others, he does only at the command of the\nemperor.\nXIII. This, therefore, was all the power which was then possessed by the\nbishop of Rome,—to oppose rebellious and refractory persons, in cases\nwhich required some extraordinary remedy, and that in order to assist,\nnot to hinder, other bishops. Therefore he assumes to himself no more\npower over others than he grants to all others over himself, when he\nprofesses that he is ready to be reproved by all, and to be corrected by\nall. So in another epistle he commands the bishop of Aquileia to come to\nRome to plead his cause in a controversy which had arisen between him\nand his neighbours, respecting an article of faith; nevertheless he\ngives this command, not from his own authority, but in consequence of\nthe mandate of the emperor. Nor does he announce himself as the sole\njudge, but promises to assemble a synod to judge of the whole affair.\nBut though there was still such moderation, that the power of the Roman\nsee had its certain limits, which it was not permitted to exceed, and\nthe bishop of Rome himself no more presided over others than he was\nsubject to them, yet it appears how very displeasing this situation was\nto Gregory. For he frequently complains, that under the name of being a\nbishop, he was forced back to the world, and that he was more involved\nin secular cares than ever he had been while he was a layman; so that in\nthat honour he was oppressed with the tumult of worldly business. In\nanother passage he says, “Such a vast burden of occupations presses me\ndown, that my mind is incapacitated for any elevation towards things\nabove. I am tossed about with numerous causes, like so many waves; and\nafter my former seasons of retirement and tranquillity, I am disquieted\nwith the tempests of a tumultuous life; so that I may truly say, I am\ncome into the depth of the sea, and the tempest has drowned me.” Judge,\nthen, what he would have said, if he had fallen upon these times. If he\ndid not fulfil the office of a pastor, yet he was employed in it. He\nrefrained from all interference in the civil government, and\nacknowledged himself to be subject to the emperor in common with others.\nHe never intruded into the care of other Churches, except when he was\nconstrained by necessity. And yet he considered himself to be in a\nlabyrinth, because he could not wholly devote himself to the exclusive\nduties of a bishop.\nXIV. The bishop of Constantinople, as we have already stated, was at\nthat time engaged in a contest with the bishop of Rome, respecting the\nprimacy. For after the seat of the empire was fixed at Constantinople,\nthe majesty of the government seemed to require that Church to be the\nnext in dignity to the Church of Rome. And indeed at the beginning\nnothing contributed more to establish the primacy in the Church of Rome\nthan the circumstance of that city being then the capital of the empire.\nGratian recites a rescript under the name of Pope Lucinus, in which he\nsays that the distinction of cities appointed to be the residence of\nmetropolitans and primates, was regulated by no other rule than the\nnature of the civil government previously established in them. There is\nanother similar rescript, also, under the name of Pope Clement, in which\nhe says, that patriarchs had been appointed in those cities which had\nanciently been the stations of arch-flamens. This statement, though\nerroneous, approaches to the truth. For it is certain, that in order to\nmake as little change as possible, the provinces were divided according\nto the existing state of things, and that primates and metropolitans\nwere placed in those cities which had precedence of the rest in dignity\nand power. Therefore, in the Council of Turin, it was decreed, that\nthose which were the chief cities of the respective provinces in the\ncivil government, should be the principal sees of bishops; and that if\nthe honour of the civil government should happen to be transferred from\none city to another, the seat of the metropolitan should be removed to\nthe same place. But Innocent, the Roman pontiff, seeing the ancient\ndignity of his city beginning to decline, after the translation of the\nseat of the empire to Constantinople, and trembling for the honour of\nhis see, enacted a contrary law; in which he denies the necessity of a\nchange of the ecclesiastical capitals, in consequence of a change of the\nimperial capitals. But the authority of a council ought to be preferred\nto the sentence of an individual, and we may justly suspect Innocent\nhimself in his own cause. He proves by his decree, however, that the\noriginal regulation had been for the seats of metropolitans to be\ndisposed according to the civil rank of the respective cities.\nXV. According to this ancient ordinance, it was decreed in the first\nCouncil of Constantinople, that the bishop of that city should have the\nnext rank and dignity to the bishop of Rome, because that was a new\nRome. But when a similar decree was passed long after in the Council of\nChalcedon, Leo strenuously opposed it. And he not only took the liberty\nof pouring contempt on what had been decided by upwards of six hundred\nbishops, but likewise heavily reproached them with having taken from\nother sees the honour which they had ventured to confer on the Church of\nConstantinople. Now, what could incite him to disturb the world for so\ninsignificant a cause, but mere ambition? He says, that what had once\nbeen determined by the Council of Nice, ought to have been maintained\ninviolable. As if the Christian faith were endangered by the preference\nof one Church to another, or as if the patriarchates had been\ndistributed by the Council of Nice with any other view than the\npreservation of external order. Now, we know that external order admits,\nand even requires, various changes, according to the various\ncircumstances of different periods. It is a futile pretence, therefore,\nof Leo, that the honour, which the authority of the Nicene council had\ngiven to the see of Alexandria, ought not to be conferred on that of\nConstantinople. For common sense dictates, that this was such a decree\nas might be abolished according to the state of the times. And besides,\nthe repeal met with no opposition from the bishops of the East, who were\nmost interested in the matter. Proterius, who had been appointed bishop\nof Alexandria instead of Dioscorus, was present; as were other\npatriarchs, whose dignity was lessened by this measure. It was for them\nto oppose it, and not Leo, who retained his original station unaltered.\nWhen they all suffered it to pass without any objection, and even\nassented to it, and the bishop of Rome was the only one who resisted it,\nit is easy to judge by what motive he was influenced. He foresaw, what\nactually came to pass not long after, that as the glory of Rome was\ndeclining, Constantinople would not be content with the second place,\nbut would contend for the primacy. Yet all his clamour was unavailing;\nthe decree of the council was confirmed. Therefore his successors,\nseeing themselves vanquished, peaceably refrained from such obstinacy;\nfor they decreed that he should be accounted the second patriarch.\nXVI. But a little while after, John, who presided over the Church of\nConstantinople while Gregory was bishop of Rome, had the arrogance to\nassume the title of universal patriarch. Gregory, not afraid of\ndefending his see in a good cause, resolutely opposed this assumption.\nAnd certainly it betrayed intolerable pride and folly in John to wish to\nmake the limits of his bishopric the same with those of the empire. Now,\nGregory did not claim to himself what he denied to another; but\nexecrated the title, by whomsoever it might be usurped, as wicked and\nimpious. In one of his epistles he expresses his displeasure with\nEulogius, bishop of Alexandria, for having complimented him with such a\ntitle. “Behold,” says he, “in the preface of the epistle which you have\ndirected to myself, who have forbidden it, you have taken care to\nintroduce that appellation of pride, by calling me universal pope. Which\nI entreat that your holiness will not do any more; because all that you\ngive to another beyond what is reasonable, is deducted from yourself. I\nconsider nothing an honour to me, by which I see the honour of my\nbrethren diminished. For my honour is the honour of the universal\nChurch, and the perfect vigour of my brethren. If your holiness calls me\nuniversal pope, this is denying that you have any share in that which is\nwholly attributed to me.” Gregory’s was a good and honourable cause; but\nJohn, being supported by the favour of Mauritius the emperor, could not\nbe diverted from his purpose; and Cyriacus, his successor, was equally\ninflexible.\nXVII. At length Phocas, who ascended the throne after the murder of\nMauritius, being more favourable to the Romans,—for what reason I know\nnot, unless because he had been crowned at Rome without any\ndifficulty,—granted to Boniface the Third what Gregory had never\ndemanded,—that Rome should be the head of all Churches. Thus the\ncontroversy was decided. Yet this grant of the emperor could not have\nbeen so much to the advantage of the see of Rome, if it had not been\nfollowed by other things. For Greece and all Asia soon after separated\nfrom its communion. France reverenced it only so far as not to carry its\nobedience beyond its inclinations; nor was it reduced to entire\nsubjection, till Pepin had usurped the crown. For after Zachary, the\nRoman pontiff, had assisted Pepin in the commission of treason and\nrobbery, in deposing his lawful sovereign, and taking possession of the\nthrone, he was rewarded by having the see of Rome invested with\njurisdiction over the Gallican Churches. As robbers are accustomed to\ndivide their common booty, so those worthy persons concerted together,\nthat Pepin should have the temporal and civil sovereignty after the\ndeposition of the rightful monarch, and that Zachary should be made the\nhead over all bishops, and enjoy the spiritual power. At first this was\nfeeble, as is generally the case with new establishments; but it was\nafterwards confirmed by the authority of Charlemagne, and almost from a\nsimilar cause; for he also was indebted to the Roman pontiff, for his\nexertions in raising him to the dignity of emperor. Now, though it is\nprobable that the Churches, before that time, had in general been\ngreatly disfigured, it is evident that in France and Germany the ancient\nform of the Church was then entirely obliterated. The archives of the\nparliament of Paris still contain brief registers of those times, which,\nin relating ecclesiastical events, make frequent mention of the treaties\nboth of Pepin and Charlemagne with the Roman pontiff; from which it may\nbe concluded that an alteration was then made in the ancient state of\nthe Church.\nXVIII. From that time, as things daily became worse and worse, the\ntyranny of the Roman see was gradually established and increased, and\nthat partly through the ignorance, and partly through the indolence, of\nthe bishops. For while the Roman pontiff was usurping every thing to\nhimself, and proceeding from one assumption to another, without any\nlimits, in defiance of law and justice, the bishops did not exert\nthemselves with the zeal which became them to repress his cupidity, and\nwhere there was no want of inclination, they were destitute of real\nlearning and knowledge, so that they were not at all equal to such an\nimportant undertaking. We see, therefore, what a horrible profanation of\nevery thing sacred, and what a total disorganization of the Church there\nwas at Rome in the days of Bernard. He complains that the ambitious, the\navaricious, the simoniacal, the sacrilegious, the adulterous, the\nincestuous, and all who were chargeable with the most atrocious crimes,\nfrom every part of the world, resorted to Rome, in order to procure or\nto retain ecclesiastical honours by the apostolical authority; and that\nfraud, circumvention, and violence, were generally practised. He says,\nthat the judicial process which was then pursued was execrable, and not\nonly unbecoming of the Church, but disgraceful to any civil court. He\nexclaims, that the Church is full of ambitious men, and that there is\nnot one who is any more afraid of perpetrating the most flagitious\ncrimes, than robbers in their den when they are distributing the plunder\nwhich they have seized on the highway. “Few,” he says, “regard the mouth\nof the legislator; they all look at his hands, and that not without\ncause, for those hands transact all that is done by the pope. What a\nbusiness it is, that they are bought with the spoils of the Church, who\nsay to you, Well done, well done! The life of the poor is sown in the\nstreets of the rich; silver glitters in the mire; people run to it from\nall parts; it is borne away, not by the poorest, but by the strongest,\nor perhaps by him who runs fastest. This custom, or rather this mortal\ncorruption, commenced not with you; I wish it may end with you. In these\ncircumstances you, a pastor, are proceeding, covered with abundant and\ncostly attire. If I might dare to use the expression, these are rather\nthe pastors of devils than of sheep. Did Peter act in this manner? Was\nPaul guilty of such trifling? Your court has been accustomed to receive\nmen good, more than to make them so. For the wicked are not improved in\nit, but the good are corrupted.” The abuses of appeals which he relates,\nno pious person can read without the greatest horror. At length,\nrespecting the insatiable cupidity of the see of Rome in the usurpation\nof jurisdiction, he concludes in the following manner: “I speak the\nmurmur and common complaint of the Churches. They exclaim that they are\ndivided and dismembered. There are few or none of them who do not either\nbewail or dread this plague. Do you inquire what plague? Abbots are torn\naway from their bishops, bishops from their archbishops. It is wonderful\nif this can be excused. By such conduct you prove that you have a\nplenitude of power, but not of justice. You act thus because you can,\nbut the question is whether you ought. You are appointed to preserve to\nall their respective honour and rank, and not to envy them.” These few\npassages I have thought proper to recite, out of a great many, partly\nthat the readers may see how sadly the Church had then declined, and\npartly that they may know into what sorrow and lamentation all good men\nwere plunged by this calamity.\nXIX. But though we should grant to the Roman pontiff in the present day\nthe same eminence and extent of jurisdiction which this see possessed in\nthe middle ages, as in the times of Leo and Gregory, what is that to the\nPapacy in its present state? I am not yet referring to the temporal and\nsecular power, which we shall afterwards examine in its proper place;\nbut the spiritual government itself of which they boast, what\nresemblance has it to the condition of those times? For the Romanists\ndesignate the pope no otherwise than as the supreme head of the Church\non earth, and universal bishop of the whole world. And the pontiffs\nthemselves, when they speak of their authority, pronounce with great\nsuperciliousness, that they have the power to command, and that to\nothers is only left the necessity to obey; that all their decrees are to\nbe received as if they were confirmed by the voice of St. Peter; that\nfor want of their presence, provincial synods have no authority; that\nthey have the power to ordain priests and deacons for all the Churches,\nand to summon to their see those who have been elsewhere ordained. In\nthe Decretal of Gratian there are innumerable pretensions of this kind,\nwhich I forbear to recite, lest I should be too tedious to my readers.\nBut the sum of them all comes to this; that the Roman pontiff alone has\nthe supreme cognizance of all ecclesiastical causes, whether in judging\nand determining doctrines, in enacting laws, in regulating discipline,\nor in exercising jurisdiction. It would also be tedious and superfluous\nto enumerate the privileges which they assume to themselves in\nreservations, as they call them. But what is the most intolerable of\nall, they leave no judgment on earth to curb or restrain their cupidity,\nif they abuse such unlimited power. “It cannot be lawful,” they say,\n“for any one to reject the judgment of this see, on account of the\nprimacy of the Roman Church.” Again: “The judge shall not be judged,\neither by the emperor or by kings, or by all the clergy, or by the\npeople.” This is arrogance beyond all bounds, for one man to constitute\nhimself judge of all, and to refuse to submit to the judgment of any.\nBut what if he exercise tyranny over the people of God, if he divide and\ndesolate the kingdom of Christ, if he disturb and overturn the whole\nChurch, if he pervert the pastoral office into a system of robbery? Even\nthough he should go to the greatest extremes of profligacy and mischief,\nhe denies that he is at all accountable for his conduct. For these are\nthe very words of the pontiffs: “God has been pleased to decide the\ncauses of other men by the judgment of men, but the prelate of this see\nhe has, without all question, reserved to his own judgment.” Again, “The\nactions of our subjects are judged by us; but ours by God alone.”\nXX. And that such edicts might have the more weight, they have falsely\nsubstituted the names of ancient pontiffs, as if things had been so\nregulated from the beginning; whereas it is very certain, that every\nthing, which attributes to the Roman pontiff more than we have stated to\nhave been given him by the ancient councils, is a novel and recent\nfabrication. They have even gone to such a pitch of impudence as to\npublish a rescript, under the name of Anastasius, patriarch of\nConstantinople, which declares that it had been ordained by the ancient\ncanons, that nothing should be done even in the remotest provinces,\nwithout being first reported to the Roman see. Beside the notorious\nfalsehood of this, what man will think it credible, that such a eulogium\nof the Roman see proceeded from the adversary and rival of its honour\nand dignity? But it was necessary that these Antichrists should be\ncarried to such an extreme of madness and blindness, that their iniquity\nmay be evident to all men of sound understanding, who only choose to\nopen their eyes. But the Decretal Epistles, complied by Gregory the\nNinth, as well as the Constitutions of Clement the Fifth, and the\nDecrees of Martin, still more openly and expressly betray, in every\npage, the inhuman ferocity and tyranny of barbarous kings. But these are\nthe oracles from which the Romanists wish their Papacy to be\nappreciated. Hence proceeded those famous axioms, which at the present\nday are universally received by them as oracles: That the pope cannot\nerr; that the pope is superior to all councils; that the pope is the\nuniversal bishop of all Churches, and supreme head of the Church upon\nearth. I pass over the far greater absurdities, which foolish canonists\nmaintain in their schools; which, however, the Roman theologians not\nonly assent to, but even applaud, in order to flatter their idol.\nXXI. I shall not treat them with all the severity which they deserve. To\nthis consummate insolence, another person would oppose the declaration\nof Cyprian among the bishops at the Council of Carthage, of which he was\npresident: “No one of us calls himself bishop of bishops, or, by\ntyrannical fear, constrains his colleagues to the necessity of obeying\nhim.” He would object what was decreed at Carthage some time after,\n“That no one should be called _prince of priests, or first bishop_.” He\nwould collect many testimonies from histories, many canons of councils,\nand various passages from the writings of the fathers, by which the\nRoman pontiff would be reduced to the rank of other bishops. I pass over\nthese things, however, that I may not appear to lay too much stress upon\nthem. But let the most able advocates of the Roman see answer me, with\nwhat face they can dare to defend the title of _universal bishop_, which\nthey find to have been so often anathematized by Gregory. If the\ntestimony of Gregory be entitled to any credit, they cannot make their\npontiff universal bishop without thereby declaring him to be Antichrist.\nNor was the title of _head_ any more in use at that time; for in one of\nhis epistles he says, “Peter is the principal member in the body; John,\nAndrew, and James, were heads of particular people. Yet they are all\nmembers of the Church under one head. Even the saints before the law,\nthe saints under the law, the saints under grace, are all placed among\nthe members, and no one ever wished himself to be called _universal_.”\nThe arrogant pretensions of the pontiff to the power of commanding are\nvery inconsistent with an observation made by Gregory in another\npassage. For when Eulogius, bishop of Alexandria, had represented\nhimself as commanded by him, he replies in the following manner:—“I\nbeseech you, let me not hear the word _command_ mentioned again; for I\nknow what I am, and what you are. In station, you are my brethren; in\nholiness, you are my fathers. Therefore I gave no command, but intended\nto suggest to you such things as appeared to be useful.” By extending\nhis jurisdiction, as he does, without any limits, the pope does a\ngrievous and atrocious injury, not only to other bishops, but to all\nother Churches, which he distracts and divides by such conduct, in order\nto establish his own see upon their ruins. But when he exempts himself\nfrom all the judgments of others, and determines to reign in such a\ntyrannical manner as to have no law but his own pleasure, this is\ncertainly so unbecoming, and foreign from the order of the Church, that\nit is altogether intolerable, and incapable of any defence. For it is\nutterly repugnant, not only to every sentiment of piety, but even of\nhumanity.\nXXII. But that I may not be obliged to pursue and discuss every\nparticular point, I again appeal to those of my contemporaries, who\nwould be considered as the most able and faithful advocates of the Roman\nsee, whether they are not ashamed to defend the present state of the\nPapacy, which is evidently a hundred times more corrupt than it was in\nthe times of Gregory and Bernard, but which even then so exceedingly\ndispleased those holy men. Gregory every where complains, that he was\nexcessively distracted with occupations unsuitable to his office; that\nunder the name of being a bishop, he was carried back to the world; that\nhe was involved in secular cares, to a greater extent than he could\nremember to have been while he was a layman; that he was oppressed with\nthe tumult of worldly business, so that his mind was incapacitated for\nany elevation towards things above; that he was tossed about with\nnumerous causes like so many waves, and disquieted with the tempests of\na tumultuous life, so that he might justly say, “I am come into the\ndepth of the sea.” Amidst these worldly avocations, however, he could\nstill instruct the people by public preaching, give private admonition\nand reproof to those who required it, regulate his Church, give advice\nto his colleagues, and exhort them to their duty; beside these things,\nhe had some time left for writing; yet he deplores his calamity, in\nbeing plunged into the depth of the sea. If the administration of that\nage was a sea, what must be said of the Papacy in its present state? For\nwhat resemblance is there between them? Here we find no sermons\npreached, no attention to discipline, no concern for the Churches, no\nspiritual function performed; in a word, nothing but the world. Yet this\nlabyrinth is praised, as though nothing could be found better\nconstituted, or better administered. What complaints are poured out by\nBernard, what lamentations does he utter, when he beholds the vices of\nhis times? What would he say, then, if he could behold this our iron,\nor, if possible, worse than iron age? What impudence is it, not only\npertinaciously to defend as sacred and Divine what all the holy fathers\nhave reprobated with one voice, but also to abuse their testimony in\nvindication of the Papacy, which it is evident was utterly unknown to\nthem! In the time of Bernard, however, I confess the corruption was so\ngreat that there was no great difference between that age and the\npresent; but those who adduce any plea for the existing state of things\nfrom the time of Leo, Gregory, and others in that middle period, must be\ndestitute of all shame. This conduct resembles that of any one, who, to\nvindicate the monarchy of the Roman emperors, should commend the ancient\nstate of the Roman government; which would be no other than borrowing\nthe praises of liberty to adorn a system of tyranny.\nXXIII. Lastly, though all these things were conceded to them, they would\nbe called to a new controversy, when we deny that there exists at Rome a\nChurch in which such privileges can reside, or a bishop capable of\nexercising these dignified prerogatives. Supposing, therefore, all these\nthings to be true, which, however, we have already refuted,—that, by the\nvoice of Christ, Peter had been constituted head of the universal\nChurch; that the honour vested in him he had committed to the Roman see;\nthat this had been established by the authority of the ancient Church,\nand confirmed by long usage; that all men, with one consent, had\ninvariably acknowledged the supreme power of the Roman pontiff; that he\nhad been the judge in all causes and of all men, and had been subject to\nthe judgment of none;—though they should have all these concessions, and\nany more that they wished, yet I reply in one word, that none of them\nwould be of any avail, unless there be at Rome a Church and a bishop.\nThey must of necessity allow, that Rome cannot be the mother of\nChurches, unless it be itself a Church, and that he cannot be the prince\nof bishops, who is not a bishop himself. Do they wish, then, to make\nRome the apostolic see? Let them show me a true and legitimate\napostleship. Do they wish to have the supreme pontiff? Let them show me\na bishop. But where will they show us any form or appearance of a\nChurch? They mention it, indeed, and have it frequently in their mouths.\nBut the Church is known by certain marks, and a bishopric is a name of\noffice. I am not now speaking of the people, but of the government\nitself, which ought always to appear in the Church. Where is the\nministry, such as Christ’s institution requires? Let us remember what\nhas already been said of the office of presbyters and bishops. If we\nbring the office of cardinals to that rule, we shall confess that they\nhave no resemblance to presbyters. And I should wish to know what\nresemblance the pontiff himself bears to a bishop. The first duty of the\nepiscopal office is to instruct the people from the word of God; the\nsecond duty, closely connected with the first, is to administer the\nsacraments; the third is to admonish, exhort, and reprove those who\noffend, and to regulate the people by holy discipline. Which of these\nduties does he perform? Which of them does he even pretend to perform?\nLet them tell me, then, upon what principle they require him to be\nconsidered as a bishop, who never, even in appearance, with his little\nfinger touches the least portion of the duty.\nXXIV. The case of a bishop is different from that of a king, who still\nretains the honour and title of a king, though he execute none of the\nroyal functions. But in judging of a bishop, regard is to be paid to the\ncommission of Christ, which ought always to continue in force in the\nChurch. Let the Romanists, therefore, furnish me with a solution of this\ndifficulty. I deny that their pontiff is the chief of bishops, because\nhe is not a bishop himself. Now, they must prove this second member of\nmy position to be false, if they will obtain the victory in the first.\nBut what must be the conclusion, if he not only has no characteristic of\na bishop, but every thing contrary to it? But here where shall I begin?\nwith his doctrine, or his conduct? What shall I say? What shall I omit?\nWhere shall I stop? I will make this assertion—that as the world is at\npresent filled with so many corrupt and impious doctrines, loaded with\nsuch various kinds of superstitions, blinded with such numerous errors,\nand immerged in such profound idolatry,—there is not one of these evils\nwhich has not originated from the see of Rome, or at least been\nconfirmed by it. Nor is there any other cause for the violent rage of\nthe pontiffs against the revived doctrine of the gospel, and for their\nexertion of all their power to crush it, and their instigation of all\nkings and princes to persecute it, but that they see that their whole\nkingdom will decline and fall to the ground, where the primitive gospel\nof Christ shall be received. Leo was cruel; Clement was sanguinary; Paul\nis ferocious. But it is not so much that nature has impelled them to\nimpugn the truth, as that this was the only way to defend their power.\nAs they cannot be safe, therefore, without ruining Christ, they labour\nin this cause as if it were in the defence of their religion, their\nhabitations, their lives. What, then, shall we consider that as the\napostolic see, where we behold nothing but a horrible apostasy? Shall he\nbe regarded as the vicar of Christ, who, by his furious exertions in\npersecuting the gospel, unequivocally declares himself to be Antichrist?\nShall he be deemed Peter’s successor, who rages with fire and sword to\ndemolish all that Peter built? Shall we acknowledge him to be head of\nthe Church, who, after severing the Church from Christ, its only true\nHead, divides and tears it in pieces? Though it be admitted that Rome\nwas once the mother of all Churches, yet from the time when it began to\nbe the seat of Antichrist, it has ceased to be what it was before.\nXXV. Some persons think us too severe and censorious, when we call the\nRoman pontiff Antichrist. But those who are of this opinion do not\nconsider that they bring the same charge of presumption against Paul\nhimself, after whom we speak, and whose language we adopt. And lest any\none should object, that we improperly pervert to the Roman pontiff those\nwords of Paul, which belong to a different subject, I shall briefly show\nthat they are not capable of any other interpretation than that which\napplies them to the Papacy. Paul says, that Antichrist “sitteth in the\ntemple of God.”[893] In another place, also, the Holy Spirit, describing\nhis image in the person of Antiochus, declares that his kingdom will\nconsist in “speaking great words,” or blasphemies, “against the Most\nHigh.”[894] Hence we conclude, that it is rather a tyranny over the\nsouls of men, than over their bodies, which is erected in opposition to\nthe spiritual kingdom of Christ. And in the next place, that this\ntyranny is one which does not abolish the name of Christ or of his\nChurch, but rather abuses the authority of Christ, and conceals itself\nunder the character of the Church, as under a mask. Now, though all the\nheresies and schisms which have existed from the beginning belong to the\nkingdom of Antichrist, yet when Paul predicts an approaching apostasy,\nhe signifies by this description that that seat of abomination shall\nthen be erected, when a universal defection shall have seized the\nChurch, notwithstanding many members, dispersed in different places,\npersevere in the unity of the faith. But when he adds, that even in his\ndays “the mystery of iniquity” did “already work”[895] in secret what it\nwas afterwards to effect in a more public manner, he gives us to\nunderstand that this calamity was neither to be introduced by one man,\nnor to terminate with one man. Now, when he designates Antichrist by\nthis character,—that he would rob God of his honour in order to assume\nit to himself,—this is the principal indication which we ought to follow\nin our inquiries after Antichrist, especially where such pride proceeds\nto a public desolation of the Church. As it is evident therefore that\nthe Roman pontiff has impudently transferred to himself some of the\npeculiar and exclusive prerogatives of God and Christ, it cannot be\ndoubted that he is the captain and leader of this impious and abominable\nkingdom.\nXXVI. Now, let the Romanists go and object antiquity against us; as if,\nin such a subversion of every thing, the honour of the see could remain,\nwhere no see exists. Eusebius relates that God, in order to make way for\nhis vengeance, removed the Church from Jerusalem to Pella. What we are\ninformed did happen once, may have happened oftener. Therefore to attach\nthe honour of the primacy to any particular place, so that he who is in\nfact the most inveterate enemy of Christ, the greatest adversary of the\ngospel, the desolater and destroyer of the Church, the most cruel\nmurderer and butcher of all the saints, must nevertheless be accounted\nthe vicar of Christ, the successor of Peter, the chief prelate of the\nChurch, merely because he occupies what was anciently the first see, is\na thing extremely ridiculous and absurd. I forbear to remark the immense\ndifference between the pope’s chancery, and a well regulated\nadministration of the Church; though this one thing is sufficient to\nremove every difficulty on this subject. For no man in his sound senses\nwill include the episcopal office in lead and in bulls, much less in\nthat school of frauds and chicaneries, in which the pope’s spiritual\ngovernment consists. It has justly been remarked, therefore, that the\nRoman Church which is boasted of, has long ago been converted into a\nsecular court, which is all that is now to be seen at Rome. Nor am I\nhere accusing the vices of individuals, but proving that the Papacy\nitself is diametrically opposite to the legitimate order of the Church.\nXXVII. But if we proceed to persons, it is well known what kind of men\nwe shall find sustaining the character of vicars of Christ. Julius, and\nLeo, and Clement, and Paul, will be pillars of the Christian faith, and\nthe principal oracles of religion, who never knew any thing of Christ,\nexcept what they had learned in the school of Lucian. But why do I\nenumerate three or four pontiffs, as though it were doubtful what kind\nof religion the pontiffs and the whole college of cardinals have\nprofessed long ago, and profess in the present day? For of the secret\ntheology which prevails among them, the first article is, that there is\nno God; the second, that all that is written and preached concerning\nJesus Christ is falsehood and imposture; the third, that the doctrine of\na future life, and that of the final resurrection, are mere fables. This\nopinion, I confess, is not entertained by all, and is expressed by few\nof them; yet it long ago began to be the ordinary religion of the\npontiffs. Though this is notorious to all who are acquainted with Rome,\nyet the Roman theologians persist in boasting that the possibility of\nerror in the pope has been prevented by the privilege of Christ, because\nhe said to Peter, “I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail\nnot.”[896] What can they gain by such impudent mockery, except it be to\nconvince the whole world of their having arrived at such an extreme of\npresumption, that they neither fear God nor regard men?\nXXVIII. But let us suppose the impiety of those pontiffs, whom I have\nmentioned, to be concealed, because they have not published it by\nsermons or by writings, but only betrayed it in their chambers and at\ntheir tables, or at least within the walls of their palaces. But if they\nwish to establish this privilege to which they pretend, they must\nexpunge from the number of the pontiffs John the Twenty-second, who\npublicly maintained that souls are mortal, and that they perish together\nwith the bodies till the day of resurrection. And to show that the whole\nsee, with its principal pillars, was then entirely overturned, not one\nof the cardinals resisted this capital error; but the university of\nParis urged the king of France to compel the pope to a retraction. The\nking interdicted his subjects from all communion with him, unless he\nshould speedily repent; and he caused this to be proclaimed, in the\nusual manner, by a herald. Compelled by necessity, the pontiff abjured\nhis error. This example renders it unnecessary for me to dispute any\nlonger against the assertion of our adversaries, that the see of Rome\nand its pontiffs cannot err respecting the faith, because Christ said to\nPeter, “I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.” John certainly\nfell from the true faith in so disgraceful a manner, that he might\nfurnish to posterity a signal proof, that those who succeed Peter in his\nbishopric are not all Peters. The argument itself, however, is too\npuerile to need any answer. For if they are determined to apply to\nPeter’s successors every thing that was said to Peter, it will follow\nthat they are all Satans, because the Lord also said to Peter, “Get thee\nbehind me, Satan; thou art an offence unto me.”[897] It will be as easy\nfor us to retort this passage against them, as it is for them to object\nthe other against us.\nXXIX. But it affords me no pleasure to contend with them in such\nfooleries, and therefore I return from the digression. To confine\nChrist, and the Holy Spirit, and the Church, to one particular place, so\nthat whoever presides there, even though he be a devil, must,\nnevertheless, be deemed the vicar of Christ, and the head of the Church,\nbecause that place was formerly the see of Peter, I maintain to be not\nonly impious and dishonourable to Christ, but altogether absurd and\nrepugnant to common sense. The Roman pontiffs for a long time have\neither been totally indifferent to religion, or have shown themselves\nits greatest enemies. They are no more made the vicars of Christ,\ntherefore, by the see which they occupy, than an idol is to be taken for\nGod, because it is placed in his temple. Now, if a judgment is to be\nformed on their conduct, let the pontiffs answer for themselves in what\npart of it they can at all be recognized as bishops. In the first place,\nthe mode of life generally pursued at Rome, not only without any\nopposition from them, but with their connivance, and even tacit\napprobation, is altogether disgraceful to bishops, whose duty it is to\nrestrain the licentiousness of the people by a rigid discipline. I will\nnot, however, be so severe against them as to charge them with the\nfaults of other persons. But while both themselves and their families,\nwith almost the whole college of cardinals, and the whole host of their\nclergy, are so abandoned to all kinds of debauchery, impurity, and\nobscenity, and to every species of enormity and crime, that they\nresemble monsters rather than men, they prove themselves to have no just\nclaim to the character of bishops. They need not be afraid, however,\nthat I shall proceed to a further disclosure of their turpitude. For it\nis unpleasant to meddle with such abominable pollution, and it is\nnecessary to spare chaste ears. Besides, I conceive, I have more than\nsufficiently proved what I intended, that even if Rome had anciently\nbeen the head of all Churches, yet at the present day she is not worthy\nof being accounted one of the smallest toes of the Church’s feet.\nXXX. With respect to the cardinals, as they are called, I know not how\nit has come to pass that they have so suddenly risen to such high\ndignity. In the time of Gregory, this title was exclusively applied to\nbishops; for whenever he mentions cardinals, he speaks of them not only\nas belonging to the Church of Rome, but to any other Churches; so that,\nin short, a cardinal priest is no other than a bishop. I find no such\ntitle at all in the writers of any preceding age; and at that time, I\nobserve, they were far inferior to bishops, to whom they are now so far\nsuperior. This passage of Augustine is well known: “Though, according to\nthe titles of honour which have long been used in the Church, a bishop\nis superior to a presbyter, yet Augustine is in many things inferior to\nJerome.” He clearly makes not the least distinction between a presbyter\nof the Roman Church and those of other Churches, but places them all\nalike below the bishops. And this order was so long observed, that in\nthe Council of Carthage, when two legates attended from the Roman see,\none a bishop, the other a presbyter, the presbyter was obliged to take\nthe lowest seat. But not to go too far into antiquity for examples, we\nhave the acts of a council held under Gregory at Rome, at which the\npresbyters sat in the lowest place, and subscribed separately; and the\ndeacons were not allowed to subscribe at all. And, indeed, the priests\nhad no other office at that time, than to attend and assist the bishop\nin the ministry of the word and the administration of the sacraments.\nNow, their condition is so changed, that they are become the cousins of\nkings and emperors. And there is no doubt but they rose by degrees,\ntogether with their head, till they reached their present high dignity.\nThis also I have thought proper to suggest by the way in a few words,\nthat the reader may more fully understand, that the Roman see, in its\npresent circumstances, is widely different from its ancient state, under\nthe pretext of which it is now maintained and defended. But whatever\nthey may have been in former times, since they have now no true and\nlegitimate office in the Church, and only retain a mere name and useless\nmask of one, and since every thing belonging to them is quite contrary\nto it, it was necessary that what Gregory often forebodes should\nactually befall them: “I say it with tears, I denounce it with groans,\nthat since the sacerdotal order is fallen within, it will not long be\nable to stand without.” Or rather it was necessary that what Malachi\ndeclares of similar characters should be fulfilled in them: “Ye are\ndeparted out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye\nhave corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore\nhave I also made you contemptible and base before all the people.”[898]\nI now leave it to all pious persons to consider the nature of the lofty\nfabric of the Roman hierarchy, to which the Papists, with nefarious\nimpudence, and without any hesitation, sacrifice even the word of God\nitself, which ought to have been held venerable and sacred by heaven and\nearth, by men and angels.\nFootnote 893:\n2 Thess. ii. 4.\nFootnote 894:\nDan. vii. 25.\nFootnote 895:\n2 Thess. ii. 7.\nFootnote 896:\nLuke xxii. 32.\nFootnote 897:\nMatt. xvi. 23.\nFootnote 898:\nMal. ii. 8, 9."

          "content": "THE POWER OF THE CHURCH RESPECTING ARTICLES OF FAITH, AND ITS LICENTIOUS\nPERVERSION, UNDER THE PAPACY, TO THE CORRUPTION OF ALL PURITY OF\nDOCTRINE.\nThe next subject is the power of the Church, which is to be considered\nas residing, partly in the respective bishops, partly in councils, and\nthose either provincial or general. I speak only of the spiritual power\nwhich belongs to the Church. Now, it consists either in doctrine, in\nlegislation, or jurisdiction. The subject of doctrine contains two\nparts—the authority to establish doctrines, and the explication of them.\nBefore we enter on the particular discussion of each of these points, we\nwould apprize the pious readers, that whatever is asserted respecting\nthe power of the Church, they should be mindful to refer to the end for\nwhich Paul declares it to have been given, namely, “to edification, and\nnot to destruction;”[899] and all who make a legitimate use of it,\nconsider themselves as nothing more than “servants of Christ,”[900] and\nthe people’s “servants for Jesus’ sake.”[901] Now, the only way to edify\nthe Church is, for the ministers themselves to study to preserve to\nJesus Christ his rightful authority, which can no longer be secure than\nwhile he is left in possession of what he has received from the Father,\nthat is, to be the sole Master in the Church.[902] For of him alone, and\nof no other, is it said, “Hear ye him.”[903] The power of the Church,\ntherefore, is not to be depreciated, yet it must be circumscribed by\ncertain limits, that it may not be extended in every direction,\naccording to the caprice of men. It will, therefore, be highly useful to\nobserve how it is described by the prophets and apostles. For if we\nsimply grant to men the power which they may be pleased to assume, it\nmust be obvious to every one, what a door will be opened for tyranny,\nwhich ought never to be seen in the Church of Christ.\nII. Here, therefore, it is necessary to remember, that whatever\nauthority and dignity is attributed by the Holy Spirit, in the\nScripture, either to the priests and prophets under the law, or to the\napostles and their successors, it is all given, not in a strict sense to\nthe persons themselves, but to the ministry over which they were\nappointed, or, to speak more correctly, to the word, the ministration of\nwhich was committed to them. For if we examine them all in succession,\nwe shall not find that they were invested with any authority to teach or\nto answer inquiries, but in the name and word of the Lord. For when they\nwere called to their office, it was at the same time enjoined that they\nshould bring forward nothing of themselves, but should speak from the\nmouth of the Lord. Nor did he send them forth in public to address the\npeople, before he had instructed them what they should say, that they\nmight speak nothing beside his word. Moses himself, the prince of all\nthe prophets, was to be heard above all others; but he was first\nfurnished with his commission, that he might not be able to announce any\nthing except from the Lord. Therefore the people, when they received his\ndoctrine, were said to “believe the Lord and his servant Moses.”[904]\nThe authority of the priests also, that it might not fall into contempt,\nwas confirmed by the severest punishments.[905] But, on the other hand,\nthe Lord shows on what condition they were to be heard, when he says,\n“My covenant was with Levi. The law of truth was in his mouth.” And just\nafterwards, “The priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should\nseek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of\nhosts.”[906] Therefore, if a priest would be heard, it was necessary for\nhim to prove himself the messenger of God, by faithfully communicating\nthe commands which he had received from his master; and where attention\nto the priests is enjoined, it is expressly stated, that “they shall\nteach the sentence of the law”[907] of God.\nIII. The power of the prophets is fully and beautifully described in\nEzekiel. “Son of man,” says the Lord, “I have made thee a watchman unto\nthe house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them\nwarning from me.”[908] When he is commanded to hear from the mouth of\nthe Lord, is he not prohibited to invent any thing of himself? And what\nis it to give warning from the Lord, but, to speak in such a manner as\nto be able to declare with confidence that the message he has brought is\nnot his own, but the Lord’s? The Lord expresses the same thing in other\nwords in the prophecy of Jeremiah: “The prophet that hath a dream, let\nhim tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word\nfaithfully.”[909] He clearly delivers a law for them all; its import is,\nthat he permits no one to teach more than he has been commanded; and he\nafterwards gives the appellation of “chaff” to every thing that has not\nproceeded from himself alone. Not one of the prophets opened his mouth,\ntherefore, without having first received the words from the Lord. Hence\ntheir frequent use of these expressions: “The word of the Lord,” “The\nburden of the Lord,” “Thus saith the Lord,” “The mouth of the Lord hath\nspoken;” and this was highly necessary; for Isaiah exclaimed, “I am a\nman of unclean lips;”[910] and Jeremiah said, “Behold, I cannot speak,\nfor I am a child.”[911] What could proceed from the pollution of the\none, and the folly of the other, but impure and foolish speeches, if\nthey had spoken their own words? But their lips were holy and pure, when\nthey began to be the organs of the Holy Spirit. While the prophets were\nbound by this law to deliver nothing but what they had received, they\nwere likewise adorned with eminent power and splendid titles. For when\nthe Lord declares, “See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and\nover the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to\nthrow down, and to build, and to plant,” he at the same time assigns the\nreason—“Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.”[912]\nIV. If we advert to the apostles, they are certainly honoured with many\nextraordinary characters. It is said that they are “the light of the\nworld,” and “the salt of the earth;”[913] that “he that heareth” them\n“heareth Christ;”[914] that “whatsoever” they “shall bind on earth shall\nbe bound in heaven, and whatsoever” they “shall loose on earth shall be\nloosed in heaven.”[915] But their very name shows what degree of liberty\nthey were allowed in their office; that if they were apostles, they were\nnot to declaim according to their own pleasure, but to deliver with\nstrict fidelity the commands of him who had sent them. And the language\nof Christ is sufficiently clear, in which he has defined their message\nby the following commission: “Go ye, and teach all nations whatsoever I\nhave commanded you.”[916] He had even received and imposed on himself\nthe same law, in order that no one might refuse to submit to it. “My\ndoctrine,” says he, “is not mine, but his that sent me.”[917] He who was\nalways the eternal and only counsellor of the Father, and was\nconstituted by the Father the Lord and Master of all, yet because he\nsustained the office of a teacher, prescribed, by his own example, the\nrule which all ministers ought to follow in their teaching. The power of\nthe Church, therefore, is not unlimited, but subject to the word of the\nLord, and, as it were, included in it.\nV. But whereas it has been a principle received in the Church from the\nbeginning, and ought to be admitted in the present day, that the\nservants of God should teach nothing which they have not learned from\nhim, yet they have had different modes of receiving instruction from\nhim, according to the variety of different periods; and the present mode\ndiffers from those which have preceded it. In the first place, if the\nassertion of Christ be true, that “no man knoweth the Father except the\nSon, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him,”[918] it must always\nhave been necessary for those who would arrive at the knowledge of God,\nto be directed by that eternal wisdom. For how could they have\ncomprehended the mysteries of God, or how could they have declared them,\nexcept by the teaching of him, to whom alone the secrets of the Father\nare intimately known? The saints in former ages, therefore, had no other\nknowledge of God than what they obtained by beholding him in the Son, as\nin a mirror. By this observation I mean that God never manifested\nhimself to man in any other way than by his Son, his only wisdom, light,\nand truth. From this fountain Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and\nothers, drew all the knowledge which they possessed of heavenly\ndoctrine; from this fountain the prophets themselves drew all the\ncelestial oracles which they spoke and wrote. But this wisdom has not\nalways manifested itself in the same way. With the patriarchs God\nemployed secret revelations; for the confirmation of which, however, he\nat the same time added such signs that they could not entertain the\nleast doubt that it was God who spake to them. What the patriarchs had\nreceived, they transmitted from hand to hand to their posterity; for the\nLord had committed it to them on the express condition that they should\nso propagate it. Succeeding generations, from the testimony of God in\ntheir hearts, knew that what they heard was from heaven, and not from\nthe earth.\nVI. But when it pleased God to raise up a more visible form of a church,\nit was his will that his word should be committed to writing, in order\nthat the priests might derive from it whatever they would communicate to\nthe people, and that all the doctrine which should be delivered might be\nexamined by that rule. Therefore, after the promulgation of the law,\nwhen the priests were commanded to teach “out of the mouth of the Lord,”\nthe meaning is, that they should teach nothing extraneous, or different\nfrom that system of doctrine which the Lord had comprised in the law; it\nwas not lawful for them to add to it or to diminish from it. Afterwards\nfollowed the prophets, by whom God published new oracles, which were to\nbe added to the law; yet they were not so new but that they proceeded\nfrom the law, and bore a relation to it. For in regard to doctrine, the\nprophets were merely interpreters of the law, and added nothing to it\nexcept prophecies of things to come. Except these, they brought forward\nnothing but pure explication of the law. But because it pleased God that\nthere should be a more evident and copious doctrine, for the better\nsatisfaction of weak consciences, he directed the prophecies also to be\ncommitted to writing, and to be accounted a part of his word. To these\nlikewise were added the histories, which were the productions of the\nprophets, but composed under the dictation of the Holy Spirit. I class\nthe Psalms with the prophecies, because what we attribute to the\nprophecies is common to the Psalms. That whole body of Scripture,\ntherefore, consisting of the Law, the Prophets, the Psalms, and the\nHistories, was the word of God to the ancient Church; and to this\nstandard the priests and teachers, even to the coming of Christ, were\nbound to conform their doctrine; nor was it lawful for them to deviate\neither to the right hand or to the left, because their office was wholly\nconfined within these limits, that they should answer the people from\nthe mouth of God. And this may be inferred from that remarkable passage\nof Malachi, where he commands the Jews to remember the law, and to be\nattentive to it, even till the publication of the gospel.[919] For in\nthat injunction he drives them off from all adventitious doctrines, and\nprohibits even the smallest deviation from the path which Moses had\nfaithfully showed them. And it is for this reason that David so\nmagnifies the excellence of the law, and recounts so many of its\npraises; to prevent the Jews from desiring any addition to it, since it\ncontained every thing necessary for them to know.\nVII. But when, at length, the Wisdom of God was manifested in the flesh,\nit openly declared to us all that the human mind is capable of\ncomprehending, or ought to think, concerning the heavenly Father. Now,\ntherefore, since Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, has shone upon us, we\nenjoy the full splendour of Divine truth, resembling the brightness of\nnoonday, whereas the light enjoyed before was a kind of twilight. For\ncertainly the apostle intended to state no unimportant fact when he\nsaid, that “God, who, at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in\ntime past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days\nspoken unto us by his Son;”[920] for he here suggests, and even plainly\ndeclares, that God will not in future, as in ages past, speak from time\nto time by one and another, that he will not add prophecies to\nprophecies, or revelations to revelations, but that he has completed all\nthe branches of instruction in his Son, so that this is the last and\neternal testimony that we shall have from him; for which reason this\nwhole period of the New Testament, from the appearance of Christ to us\nin the first promulgation of his gospel, even to the day of judgment, is\ndesignated as “the last time,” “the last times,” “the last days;” in\norder that, being content with the perfection of the doctrine of Christ,\nwe may learn neither to invent any thing new or beyond it ourselves, nor\nto receive any such thing from the invention of others. It is not\nwithout cause, therefore, that the Father has given us his Son by a\npeculiar privilege, and appointed him to be our teacher, commanding\nattention to be paid to him, and not to any mere man. He has recommended\nhis tuition to us in few words, when he says, “Hear ye him;”[921] but\nthere is more weight and energy in them than is commonly imagined; for\nthey call us away from all the instructions of men, and place us before\nhim alone; they command us to learn from him alone all the doctrine of\nsalvation, to depend upon him, to adhere to him, in short, as the words\nexpress, to listen solely to his voice. And, indeed, what ought now to\nbe either expected or desired from man, when the Word of Life himself\nhas familiarly presented himself before us? It is rather necessary that\nthe mouths of all men should be shut, since he has once spoken, in whom\nit has pleased the heavenly Father that all the treasures of wisdom and\nknowledge should be hidden,[922] and has spoken in a manner becoming the\nwisdom of God, in which there is no imperfection, and the Messiah, who\nwas expected to reveal all things;[923] that is, has spoken in such a\nmanner as to leave nothing to be said by others after him.\nVIII. Let us lay down this, then, as an undoubted axiom, that nothing\nought to be admitted in the Church as the word of God, but what is\ncontained first in the law and the prophets, and secondly in the\nwritings of the apostles, and that there is no other method of teaching\naright in the Church than according to the direction and standard of\nthat word. Hence we conclude, also, that the apostles were allowed no\nmore discretion than the prophets before them—namely, to expound the\nancient Scripture, and to show that the things delivered in it were\naccomplished in Christ; but this they were only to do from the Lord,\nthat is to say, under the guidance and dictation of the Spirit of\nChrist. For Christ limited their mission by this condition, when he\nordered them to go and teach, not the fabrications of their own\npresumption, but whatsoever he had commanded them.[924] And nothing\ncould be more explicit than what he said on another occasion: “Be not ye\ncalled Rabbi; for one is your Master, even Christ.”[925] To fix this\nmore deeply in their minds, he repeats it twice in the same place. And\nbecause their weakness was such that they were unable to comprehend the\nthings which they had heard and learned from the lips of their Master,\nthe Spirit of truth was promised to them, to lead them into the true\nunderstanding of all things.[926] For that restriction is to be\nattentively remarked, which assigns to the Holy Spirit the office of\nsuggesting to their minds all that Christ had before taught them with\nhis mouth.\nIX. Therefore Peter, who had been fully taught by his Master how far his\noffice extended, represents nothing as left for himself or others, but\nto dispense the doctrine committed to them by God. “If any man speak,”\nsays he, “let him speak as the oracles of God;”[927] that is, not with\nhesitation or uncertainty, like persons conscious of no sufficient\nauthority, but with the noble confidence which becomes a servant of God\nfurnished with his certain commission. What is this but rejecting all\nthe inventions of the human mind, from whatever head they may proceed,\nin order that the pure word of God may be taught and learned in the\nChurch of believers? What is this but removing all the decrees, or\nrather inventions of men, whatever be their station, that the ordinances\nof God alone may be observed? These are the spiritual “weapons, mighty\nthrough God to the pulling down of strong-holds,” by which the faithful\nsoldiers of God “cast down imaginations, and every high thing that\nexalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bring into captivity\nevery thought to the obedience of Christ.”[928] This is the extent of\nthe power with which the pastors of the Church, by whatever name they\nmay be distinguished, ought to be invested;—that by the word of God they\nmay venture to do all things with confidence; may constrain all the\nstrength, glory, wisdom, and pride of the world to obey and submit to\nhis majesty; supported by his power, may govern all mankind, from the\nhighest to the lowest; may build up the house of Christ, and subvert the\nhouse of Satan; may feed the sheep, and drive away the wolves; may\ninstruct and exhort the docile; may reprove, rebuke, and restrain the\nrebellious and obstinate; may bind and loose; may discharge their\nlightnings and thunders, if necessary; but all in the word of God.\nBetween the apostles and their successors, however, there is, as I have\nstated, this difference—that the apostles were the certain and authentic\namanuenses of the Holy Spirit, and therefore their writings are to be\nreceived as the oracles of God; but succeeding ministers have no other\noffice than to teach what is revealed and recorded in the sacred\nScriptures. We conclude, then, that it is not now left to faithful\nministers to frame any new doctrine, but that it behoves them simply to\nadhere to the doctrine to which God has made all subject, without any\nexception. In making this observation, my design is to show, not only\nwhat is lawful to individuals, but also to the universal Church. With\nrespect to particular persons, Paul had certainly been appointed by the\nLord an apostle to the Corinthians; yet he denies that he had any\ndominion over their faith.[929] Who can now dare to arrogate to himself\na dominion which Paul testifies did not belong to him? If he had\nsanctioned such a license of teaching, that whatever the pastor\ndelivered, he might require, as a matter of right, that the same should\nbe implicitly believed, he would never have recommended to the same\nCorinthians such a regulation as this: “Let the prophets speak two or\nthree, and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that\nsitteth by, let the first hold his peace.”[930] For here he exempted\nnone, but made the authority of every one subject to the control of the\nword of God. But the case of the universal Church, it will be said, is\ndifferent. I reply—Paul has obviated this objection in another place,\nwhen he says that “faith cometh by hearing, and hearing, by the word of\nGod.”[931] But if it be the word of God alone upon which faith is\nsuspended, towards which it looks, and on which it relies, I ask what is\nthere left for the word of the whole world? Here it will be impossible\nfor any man to hesitate who has really known what faith is. For it ought\nto rest on such firm ground as to stand invincible and undismayed in\nopposition to Satan, to all the machinations of hell, and to all the\nassaults of the world. This stability we shall find in the word of God\nalone. Besides the reason which we are here required to consider is of\nuniversal application—that God denies to man the right of promulgating\nany new article of faith, in order that he alone may be our Master in\nspiritual doctrine, as he alone is true beyond all possibility of\ndeceiving or being deceived. This reason is no less applicable to the\nwhole Church than to every individual believer.\nX. But if this power, which we have shown to belong to the Church, be\ncompared with that which has now for some ages past been claimed over\nthe people of God by the spiritual tyrants who have falsely called\nthemselves bishops and prelates of religion, there will be no more\nresemblance than there is between Christ and Belial. It is not my\nintention here to expose the shameful methods in which they have\nexercised their tyranny: I shall only state the doctrine, which they\ndefend in the present age, not only by their writings, but also by fire\nand sword. As they take it for granted that a universal council is the\ntrue representative of the Church, having assumed this principle, they\nat once determine, as beyond all doubt, that such councils are under the\nimmediate direction of the Holy Spirit, and therefore cannot err. Now,\nas they themselves influence the councils, and even constitute them, the\nfact is, that they assume to themselves all that they contend for as\nbelonging to the councils. They wish our faith, therefore, to stand or\nfall at their pleasure, that whatever they may have determined on one\nside or the other, may be implicitly received by our minds as fully\ndecided; so that if they approve of any thing, we must approve of the\nsame without any hesitation; and if they condemn any thing, we must\nunite in the condemnation of it. At the same time, according to their\nown caprice, and in contempt of the word of God, they fabricate\ndoctrines which, for no other reason than this, they require to be\nbelieved. For they acknowledge no man as a Christian, who does not fully\nassent to all their dogmas, affirmative as well as negative, if not with\nan explicit, at least with an implicit faith, because they pretend that\nthe Church has authority to make new articles of faith.\nXI. First, let us hear by what arguments they prove this authority to\nhave been given to the Church; and then we shall see how far their\nallegations respecting the Church contribute to support their cause. The\nChurch, they say, has excellent promises, that she is never to be\nforsaken by Christ, her spouse, but will be led by his Spirit into all\ntruth.[932] But of the promises which they are accustomed to allege,\nmany are given no less to each believer in particular, than collectively\nto the whole Church. For though the Lord was addressing the twelve\napostles when he said, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of\nthe world;”[933] and “I will pray the Father, and he shall give you\nanother comforter, even the Spirit of truth;”[934] he made these\npromises not only to the apostles considered as a body, but to every one\nof the number, and even to the other disciples whom he had already\nreceived, or who were afterwards to be added to them. Now, when they\ninterpret these promises, replete with peculiar consolation, in such a\nsense as if they were given to no individual Christian, but only to the\nwhole Church collectively, what is this but depriving all Christians of\nthe confidence with which such promises ought to animate them? Here I do\nnot deny that the whole society of believers, being adorned with a\nmanifold variety of gifts, possesses a more ample and precious treasure\nof heavenly wisdom, than each particular individual; nor do I intend\nthat these things are spoken of believers in common, as if they were all\nequally endued with the spirit of understanding and doctrine; but we\nmust not allow the adversaries of Christ, in defence of a bad cause, to\nwrest the Scripture to a sense which it was not intended to convey.\nLeaving this remark, I freely acknowledge that the Lord is continually\npresent with his servants, and that he guides them by his Spirit; that\nthis is not a spirit of error, ignorance, falsehood, or darkness, but\n“the spirit of wisdom, and revelation, and truth,” from whom they may\ncertainly learn “the things that are given to” them “of God,” or, in\nother words, “may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the\nriches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.”[935] But as it is\nnothing more than the first fruits, a kind of foretaste of that Spirit\nthat is enjoyed by believers in the present state, even by those of them\nwho are favoured with more excellent graces than others, there remains\nnothing for them, but that, conscious of their imbecility, they\nsolicitously confine themselves within the limits of the word of God;\nlest, if they proceed far by their own sense, they should wander from\nthe right way, in consequence of being not yet fully enlightened by that\nSpirit, by whose teaching alone truth is distinguished from falsehood.\nFor all confess with Paul, that they have not yet attained the mark;\ntherefore they rather press on towards daily improvement, than boast of\nperfection.[936]\nXII. But they will object, that whatever is partially attributed to\nevery one of the saints, completely and perfectly belongs to the whole\nChurch. Notwithstanding the plausibility of this position, yet I deny it\nto be true. I admit that God distributes the gifts of his Spirit by\nmeasure to every member of his Church, in such a manner that nothing\nnecessary is wanting to the whole body, when those gifts are bestowed in\ncommon. But the riches of the Church are always such as to be very far\nfrom that consummate perfection boasted by our adversaries. Yet the\nChurch is not left destitute in any respect, but that it always has what\nis sufficient; for the Lord knows what its necessity requires. But to\nrestrain it within the bounds of humility and pious modesty, he bestows\nno more than he sees to be expedient. Here, I know, they are accustomed\nto object, that the Church has been “cleansed by the washing of water by\nthe word, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not\nhaving spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy\nand without blemish;”[937] and that for this reason it is called “the\npillar and ground of the truth.”[938] But the former of these passages\nrather indicates what Christ is daily performing in his Church, than any\nthing that he has already accomplished. For if he is daily sanctifying,\npurifying, polishing, and cleansing his people, it must be evident that\nthey still have some spots and wrinkles, and that something is still\nwanting to their sanctification. How vain and visionary is it to imagine\nthe Church already perfectly holy and immaculate, while all its members\nare the subjects of corruption and impurity! It is true that the Church\nis sanctified by Christ, but it is only the commencement of their\nsanctification that is seen in the present state; the end and perfect\ncompletion of it will be when Christ, the Holy of Holies, shall fill it\ntruly and entirely with his holiness. It is likewise true that its spots\nand wrinkles are effaced, but in such a manner that they are in a daily\ncourse of obliteration, till Christ at his coming shall entirely efface\nall that remains. For, unless we admit this, we must of necessity\nassert, with the Pelagians, that the righteousness of believers is\nperfect in the present life, and with the Cathari and Donatists, must\nallow no infirmity in the Church. The other passage, as we have already\nseen, has a meaning totally different from what they pretend. For after\nPaul had instructed Timothy in the true nature of the office of a\nbishop, he says, “These things I write unto thee, that thou mayest know\nhow thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God;” and to enforce\nhis conscientious attention to this object, he adds, that the Church\nitself is “the pillar and ground of the truth.”[939] Now, what is the\nmeaning of this expression, but that the truth of God is preserved in\nthe Church, and that by the ministry of preaching? As in another place\nhe states, that Christ “gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some\nevangelists, and some pastors and teachers, that we be no more carried\nabout with every wind of doctrine,” or deluded by men, but that, being\nenlightened with the true knowledge of the Son of God, we may “all come\ninto the unity of the faith.”[940] The preservation of the truth,\ntherefore, from being extinguished in the world, is in consequence of\nthe Church being its faithful guardian, by whose efforts and ministry it\nis maintained. But if this guardianship consists in the ministry of the\nprophets and apostles, it follows that it wholly depends on the faithful\npreservation of the purity of the word of God.\nXIII. And that the readers may better understand upon what point this\nquestion principally turns, I will briefly state what our adversaries\nrequire, and wherein we oppose them. When they assert that the Church\ncannot err, their meaning is, as they themselves explain it, that as it\nis governed by the Spirit of God, it may safely proceed without the\nword; that whithersoever it goes, it can neither think nor speak any\nthing that is not true; and, therefore, that if it determine any thing\nbeyond or beside the Divine word, the same is to be considered in no\nother light than as a certain oracle of God. If we grant the first\npoint, that the Church cannot err in things essential to salvation, our\nmeaning is, that its security from error is owing to its renouncing all\nits own wisdom, and submitting itself to the Holy Spirit, to be taught\nby means of the word of God. This, then, is the difference between us.\nThey ascribe to the Church an authority independent of the word; we\nmaintain it to be annexed to the word, and inseparable from it. And what\nis there surprising that the spouse and disciple of Christ is subject to\nher Lord and Master, so as to be assiduously and sedulously awaiting his\ncommands and instructions? For it is the order of a well regulated\nfamily, for the wife to obey the command of the husband; it is the order\nof a well disciplined school, that nothing be heard there but the\ninstructions of the master. Wherefore let not the Church be wise of\nitself, nor think any thing of itself, but let it fix the boundary of\nits wisdom where Christ has made an end of speaking. In this manner it\nwill distrust all the inventions of its own reason; but in those things\nin which it is supported by the word of God, it will not waver with any\ndistrust or hesitation, but will rest upon it with strong certainty and\nunshaken constancy. Thus confiding in the amplitude of the promises it\nhas received, it will have an excellent support for its faith, so that\nit cannot doubt that the Holy Spirit, the best guide in the right way,\nis always present with it; but, at the same time, it will remember what\nadvantage the Lord intends should be received from his Spirit. “The\nSpirit,” says he, “whom I will send from the Father, will guide you into\nall truth.” But how will this be done? Christ says, “He shall bring all\nthings to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”[941] He\nannounces, therefore, that nothing more is to be expected from his\nSpirit, than that he will enlighten our minds to discover the truth of\nhis doctrine. Wherefore it is very judiciously observed by Chrysostom,\nthat “many boast of the Holy Spirit; but in those who speak from\nthemselves this is a false pretence. As Christ testified that he spake\nnot of himself, because he spake from the law and the prophets, so, if,\nunder the name of the Spirit, any thing be obtruded that is not\ncontained in the gospel, let us not believe it. For as Christ is the\naccomplishment of the law and the prophets, so is the Spirit, of the\ngospel.” These are the words of Chrysostom. Now, it is easy to infer how\ngreat is the error of our adversaries, who boast of the Holy Spirit for\nno other purpose than to recommend, under his name, doctrines strange\nand inconsistent with the word of God, whereas it is his determination\nto be connected with the word by an indissoluble bond; and this was\ndeclared by Christ when he promised him to his Church. And so he is, in\npoint of fact. The sobriety which the Lord has once prescribed to his\nChurch, he will have to be perpetually observed; and he has forbidden\nthe Church to add any thing to his word, or to diminish any thing from\nit. This is the inviolable decree of God and of the Holy Spirit, which\nour adversaries endeavour to abrogate, when they pretend that the Church\nis governed by the Spirit without the word.\nXIV. Here, again, they cavil, that it was necessary for the Church to\nadd some things to the writings of the apostles, or at least for the\napostles themselves afterwards to supply in their discourses what they\nhad not so explicitly delivered in their writings, because Christ\ndeclared to them, “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot\nbear them now;”[942] and that these are the ordinances which have been\nreceived by usage and custom without the Scripture. But what effrontery\nis here betrayed! I confess that the disciples were ignorant, and not\nvery docile, when the Lord made this declaration to them; but they were\nnot so stupid, when they committed their doctrine to writing, as to\nrender it necessary for them afterwards to supply in their discourses\nwhat they had from ignorance omitted in their writings. But if, when\nthey published their writings, they had already been led by the Spirit\ninto all truth, what hindered them from comprising and leaving on record\nin those writings a perfect system of evangelical doctrine? Let us grant\nour opponents, however, what they ask: only let them enumerate those\nthings which required to be revealed, and are not contained in the\napostolical writings. If they dare to attempt this, I will reply in the\nwords of Augustine, “Where the Lord has been silent, which of us can\nsay, These things or those are intended; and if he dare to say so, how\nwill he prove it?” But why do I contend a point that is unnecessary? For\neven children know that the apostolic writings, which these men\nrepresent as incomplete and essentially deficient, contain the fruit of\nthat revelation which the Lord then promised them.\nXV. What, say they, did not Christ place the doctrines and decrees of\nthe Church beyond all controversy, when he commanded him who should dare\nto contradict it, to be regarded “as a heathen man and a publican?”[943]\nIn the first place, Christ in that text makes no mention of doctrine,\nbut only asserts the authority of the Church in pronouncing censures for\nthe correction of vices, in order that its judgment may not be opposed\nby any who are admonished or reproved. But leaving this remark, it is\nastonishing, that they have no more modesty than to presume to boast of\nthat passage. For what will they extort from it, but that it is unlawful\nto despise the consent of the Church, which never consents to any thing\nexcept the truth of the word of God? The Church is to be heard, they\nsay. Who denies it? For it pronounces nothing but from the word of the\nLord. If they require any thing further, let them know that these words\nof Christ afford them no support. Nor ought it to be esteemed too\ncontentious in me to insist so strenuously on this point—That it is not\nlawful for the Church to invent any new doctrine, or to teach and\ndeliver, as of Divine authority, any thing more than the Lord has\nrevealed in his word. All persons of sound judgment perceive how\nexceedingly dangerous it would be if so much power were once granted to\nany man. For they see how wide a door is opened to the scoffs and cavils\nof the impious, if we assert that the decisions of men are to be\nreceived by Christians as articles of faith. It is also to be remarked,\nthat Christ spoke according to the established order of his own time,\nand gave this name to the Sanhedrim, that his disciples might learn\nafterwards to reverence the solemn assemblies of the Church. And thus,\non the principle of our adversaries, every city and village would have\nan equal liberty to frame new articles of faith.\nXVI. The examples which they allege are nothing to the purpose. They say\nthat the baptism of infants arose, not so much from any express command\nof Scripture, as from the decree of the Church. It would be a most\nmiserable asylum, if, in defence of infant baptism, we were compelled to\nhave recourse to the mere authority of the Church; but it will be shown\nin another place, that the fact is very different. So when they object,\nthat the Scriptures nowhere affirm what was pronounced in the Council of\nNice, that the Son is of the same substance with the Father, they do\ngreat injury to the fathers of that council, as if they had\npresumptuously condemned Arius for having refused to subscribe to their\nlanguage, while he professed all the doctrine which is contained in the\nwritings of the prophets and apostles. The word _consubstantial_,\n(ὁμοουσιος,) I confess, is not to be found in the Scripture; but while,\non the one hand, it is so often affirmed that there is but one God, and,\non the other, Christ is so frequently called the true and eternal God,\none with the Father, what have the Nicene fathers done, but simply\nexpressed the natural sense of the Scripture, in declaring the Father\nand the Son to be of one and the same substance? And Theodoret the\nhistorian states, that Constantine the emperor opened that council with\nthe following preliminary address: “In disputes on Divine subjects, we\nare to adhere to the doctrine of the Holy Spirit; the books of the\nevangelists and apostles, with the oracles of the prophets, fully reveal\nto us the will of God. Wherefore, laying aside all discord, let us take\nthe decision of all questions in debate from the words of the Spirit.”\nThere was no one at that time who opposed these holy admonitions. No one\nobjected, that the Church might add something of its own, that the\nSpirit had not revealed every thing to the apostles, or, at least, that\nthey had not transmitted the whole to posterity in writing, or any thing\nof the like nature. If what our adversaries contend for be true, in the\nfirst place, Constantine acted unjustly in depriving the Church of its\npower; and in the next place, when none of the bishops rose to vindicate\nthat power, their silence was not to be excused from treachery, for on\nthat occasion they must have betrayed the rights of the Church. But from\nthe statement of Theodoret, that they readily received what was said by\nthe emperor, it is evident that this novel dogma of our adversaries was\nat that time altogether unknown.\nFootnote 899:\n2 Cor. x. 8; xiii. 10.\nFootnote 900:\nPhil. i. 1.\nFootnote 901:\n2 Cor. iv. 5.\nFootnote 902:\nMatt. xxiii. 8.\nFootnote 903:\nMatt. xvii. 5.\nFootnote 904:\nExod. xiv. 31.\nFootnote 905:\nDeut. xvii. 8-12.\nFootnote 906:\nMal. ii. 4-7.\nFootnote 907:\nDeut. xvii. 11.\nFootnote 908:\nEzek. iii. 17.\nFootnote 909:\nJer. xxiii. 28.\nFootnote 910:\nIsaiah vi. 5.\nFootnote 911:\nJer. i. 6.\nFootnote 912:\nJer. i. 9, 10.\nFootnote 913:\nMatt. v. 13, 14.\nFootnote 914:\nLuke x. 16.\nFootnote 915:\nMatt. xviii. 18.\nFootnote 916:\nMatt. xxviii. 19, 20.\nFootnote 917:\nJohn vii. 16.\nFootnote 918:\nMatt. xi. 27.\nFootnote 919:\nMal. iv. 4.\nFootnote 920:\nHeb. i. 1, 2.\nFootnote 921:\nMatt. xvii. 5.\nFootnote 922:\nCol. i. 19; ii. 3.\nFootnote 923:\nJohn iv. 25.\nFootnote 924:\nMatt. xxviii. 19, 20.\nFootnote 925:\nMatt. xxiii. 8, 10.\nFootnote 926:\nJohn xiv. 26; xvi. 13.\nFootnote 927:\n1 Peter iv. 11.\nFootnote 928:\n2 Cor. x. 4, 5.\nFootnote 929:\n2 Cor. i. 24.\nFootnote 930:\n1 Cor. xiv. 29, 30.\nFootnote 931:\nRom. x. 17.\nFootnote 932:\nJohn xvi. 13.\nFootnote 933:\nMatt. xxviii. 20.\nFootnote 934:\nJohn xiv. 16, 17.\nFootnote 935:\nEphes. i. 17, 18.

          "title": "CHAPTER IX.",
          "content": "COUNCILS; THEIR AUTHORITY.\nThough I should concede to our adversaries all the claims which they set\nup on behalf of the Church, yet this would effect but little towards the\nattainment of their object. For whatever is said respecting the Church,\nthey immediately transfer to the councils, which they consider as\nrepresenting the Church; and it may further be affirmed, that their\nviolent contentions for the power of the Church, are with no other view\nthan to ascribe all that they can extort, to the Roman pontiff and his\nsatellites. Before I enter on the discussion of this question, it is\nnecessary for me to premise two brief observations. First, if in this\nchapter I am rather severe on our opponents, it is not that I would show\nthe ancient councils less honour than they deserve. I venerate them from\nmy heart, and wish them to receive from all men the honour to which they\nare entitled; but here some limits must be observed, that we may\nderogate nothing from Christ. Now, it is the prerogative of Christ to\npreside over all councils, and to have no mortal man associated with him\nin that dignity. But I maintain, that he really presides only where he\ngoverns the whole assembly by his word and Spirit. Secondly, when I\nattribute to the councils less than our adversaries require, I am not\ninduced to do this from any fear that the councils would favour their\ncause and oppose ours. For as we are sufficiently armed by the word of\nthe Lord, and need not seek any further assistance for the complete\nestablishment of our doctrine, and the total subversion of Popery, so,\non the other hand, if it were necessary, the ancient councils would\nfurnish us in a great measure with sufficient arguments for both these\nobjects.\nII. Let us now come to the subject itself. If it be inquired what is the\nauthority of councils according to the Scriptures, there is no promise\nmore ample or explicit than this declaration of Christ: “Where two or\nthree are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of\nthem.”[944] But this belongs no less to every particular congregation\nthan to a general council. The main stress of the question, however,\ndoes not lie in this, but in the annexed condition,—that Christ will be\nin the midst of a council, then, and then only, when it is assembled in\nhis name. Wherefore, though our adversaries mention councils of bishops\na thousand times, they will gain but little ground; nor will they\nprevail upon us to believe what they pretend,—that such councils are\ndirected by the Holy Spirit,—till it shall have been proved, that they\nare assembled in the name of Christ. For it is equally as possible for\nimpious and unfaithful bishops to conspire against Christ, as for pious\nand upright bishops to assemble together in his name. Of this we have\nample proof in numerous decrees which have been issued by such councils;\nas will be seen in the course of this discussion. At present I only\nreply in one word, that the promise of Christ is exclusively restricted\nto those who “are gathered together in his name.” Let us, therefore,\ndefine wherein this consists. I deny that they are assembled in the name\nof Christ, who, rejecting the command of God, which prohibits any\ndiminution of his word, or the smallest addition to it,[945] determine\nevery thing according to their own pleasure; who, not content with the\noracles of the Scripture, which constitute the only rule of perfect\nwisdom, invent something new out of their own heads. Since Christ has\nnot promised to be present in all councils, but has added a particular\nmark to discriminate true and legitimate councils from others, it\ncertainly behoves us by no means to neglect this distinction. This was\nthe covenant which God anciently made with the Levitical priests, that\nthey should teach their people from his mouth;[946] he always required\nthe same of the prophets; and we see that a similar law was imposed upon\nthe apostles. Those who violate this covenant, God neither dignifies\nwith the honour of the priesthood, nor invests with any authority. Let\nour adversaries solve this difficulty, if they wish me to submit my\nfaith to the decrees of men, independently of the word of God.\nIII. For their supposition, that no truth remains in the Church, unless\nit be found among the pastors, and that the Church itself stands, no\nlonger than it appears in general councils, is very far from having been\nalways correct, if the prophets have left us any authentic records of\ntheir times. In the days of Isaiah, there was a Church at Jerusalem,\nwhich God had not yet forsaken: nevertheless he speaks of the priests in\nthe following manner: “His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant;\nthey are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving\nto slumber: they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to\ntheir own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.”[947]—Hosea\nspeaks in a similar manner: “The watchman of Ephraim was with my God;\nbut the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in\nthe house of his God.”[948] By thus ironically connecting them with God,\nhe shows that their priesthood was a vain pretence. The Church continued\nalso to the time of Jeremiah. Let us hear what he says of the pastors.\n“From the prophet even unto the priest, every one dealeth falsely.”[949]\nAgain: “the prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither\nhave I commanded them.”[950] And to avoid too much prolixity in reciting\nhis words, I would recommend my readers to peruse the whole of the\ntwenty-third and fortieth chapters. Nor were the same persons treated\nwith less severity by Ezekiel: “There is a conspiracy of her prophets in\nthe midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have\ndevoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they\nhave made her many widows in the midst thereof. Her priests have\nviolated my law, and have profaned mine holy things; they have put no\ndifference between the holy and profane. Her prophets have daubed them\nwith untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them,\nsaying, Thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord hath not spoken.”[951]\nSimilar complaints abound in all the prophets, so that there is nothing\nof more frequent recurrence.\nIV. But it will be said, though such may have been the case among the\nJews, our age is exempt from so great a calamity. I sincerely wish that\nit were so; but the Holy Spirit has denounced that the event would be\nvery different. The language of Peter is clear: “There were false\nprophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers\namong you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies.”[952] Observe\nhow he declares that danger will arise, not from the common people, but\nfrom those who will assume to themselves the name of pastors and\nteachers. Besides, how often is it predicted by Christ and his apostles,\nthat the greatest dangers would be brought upon the Church by its\npastors![953] Paul expressly denounces that Antichrist will “sit in the\ntemple of God;”[954] by which he signifies, that the dreadful calamity\nof which he speaks, will arise from the very persons who will sit as\npastors in the Church. And in another place, he shows that the\ncommencement of the mischief was then near at hand. For addressing the\nbishops of the Church of Ephesus, he says, “I know this, that after my\ndeparting shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the\nflock; also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse\nthings, to draw away disciples after them.”[955] If the pastors could so\ndegenerate in a very short space of time, what enormous corruption might\nbe introduced among them in a long series of years! And not to occupy\nmuch room with an enumeration, we are taught by the examples of almost\nall ages, that neither is the truth always maintained in the bosom of\nthe pastors, nor the safety of the Church dependent on their stability.\nThey ought, indeed, to be the guardians and defenders of the peace and\nsafety of the Church, for the preservation of which they are appointed;\nbut it is one thing to perform a duty which we owe, and another, to owe\na duty which we do not perform.\nV. Let no person conclude from what I have said, that I am inclined on\nall occasions, and without any discrimination, to weaken the authority\nof pastors, and bring it into contempt. I only mean to suggest the\nnecessity of discriminating between some pastors and others, that we may\nnot immediately consider persons as pastors because they bear that\ntitle. But the pope and all his bishops, for no other reason but because\nthey are called pastors, casting off all obedience to the word of God,\ndisturb and confound every thing at their own pleasure; while they\nlabour to persuade us that it is impossible for them to be destitute of\nthe light of truth, that the Spirit of God perpetually resides in them,\nand that with them the Church lives and dies. As though the Lord had now\nno judgments, to inflict upon the world, in the present day, the same\nkind of punishment, with which he once visited the ingratitude of his\nancient people;[956] namely, to smite the pastors with astonishment,\nmadness, and blindness. And such is their extreme stupidity, they are\nnot aware that they are acting the same part which was acted by those\nwho resisted the word of the Lord in ancient times. For thus the enemies\nof Jeremiah fortified themselves in opposition to the truth: “Come, and\nlet us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish\nfrom the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the\nprophet.”[957]\nVI. Hence it is easy to reply to another plea in behalf of general\ncouncils. That a true Church existed among the Jews in the time of the\nprophets, cannot be denied. But if a general council of the priests had\nbeen convened, what appearance of a Church would such a council have\ndisplayed? We hear what God denounces, not against two or three of them,\nbut against the whole body: “The priests shall be astonished, and the\nprophets shall wonder.”[958] Again: “The law shall perish from the\npriest, and counsel from the ancients.”[959] Again: “Night shall be unto\nyou, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you,\nthat ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets,\nand the day shall be dark over them.”[960] Now, if these priests and\nprophets had all been collected together, what spirit would have\npresided in their assembly? This is remarkably exemplified in the\ncouncil convoked by Ahab. Four hundred prophets were present. But\nbecause they were assembled with no other intention than to flatter that\nimpious monarch, Satan was sent by the Lord to be a lying spirit in all\ntheir mouths.[961] There the truth was rejected with one consent;\nMicaiah was condemned as a heretic, beaten, and cast into prison.\nJeremiah received the same treatment, and other prophets experienced\nsimilar injustice.\nVII. But one example, which is more memorable than the rest, may suffice\nas a specimen of all. In the council which the chief priests and\nPharisees convened at Jerusalem against Christ, what was there wanting\nin point of external form? For if there had then been no Church at\nJerusalem, Christ would never have united in their sacrifices and other\nceremonies. A solemn summons was issued; the high priest presided; all\nthe priests attended; yet there Christ was condemned, and his doctrine\nrejected. This act proves that the Church was not contained in that\ncouncil. But, it will be said, there is no danger of such a circumstance\nhappening to us. Who has assured us of this? For to be too confident in\na matter of such great importance, is culpable stupidity. But while the\nSpirit has expressly predicted, by the mouth of Paul, that there shall\ncome an apostasy, which cannot take place without the pastors being the\nfirst to revolt from God,[962] why do we wilfully shut our eyes to our\nown ruin? Wherefore it is by no means to be conceded, that the Church\nconsists in the assembly of the pastors, respecting whom God has nowhere\npromised that they should always be good, but, on the contrary, has\ndenounced that they would sometimes be wicked. Now, when he warns us of\na danger, his design is to make us more cautious.\nVIII. What, then, it will be said, shall the decisions of councils have\nno authority? Yes, certainly; for I am not contending that all councils\nought to be condemned, or that all their acts ought to be rescinded and\ncancelled at once. Still I shall be told, that I degrade their\nauthority, so as to leave it to the option of every individual to\nreceive or reject whatever a council shall have determined. By no means;\nbut whenever a decree of any council is brought forward, I would wish,\nfirst, that a diligent inquiry should be made, at what time, for what\ncause, and with what design it was held, and what kind of persons were\npresent; secondly, that the subject discussed in it should be examined\nby the standard of the Scripture; and this in such a manner that the\ndetermination should have its weight, and be considered as a precedent\nor case formerly decided, but that it should not preclude the\nexamination which I have mentioned. I sincerely wish that every person\nwould observe the method recommended by Augustine in his third book\nagainst Maximinus. For, with a view to silence the contentions of that\nheretic respecting the decrees of councils, he says, “I ought not to\nobject to you the Council of Nice, nor ought you to object to me the\nCouncil of Ariminum, to preclude each other’s judgment by a previous\ndecision. I am not bound by the authority of the latter, nor you by that\nof the former. Let cause contend with cause, and argument with argument,\non the ground of scriptural authorities, which exclusively belong to\nneither party, but are common to both.” The consequence of such a mode\nof proceeding would be, that councils would retain all the majesty which\nis due to them, while at the same time the Scripture would hold the\npreëminence, so that every thing would be subject to its standard. Upon\nthis principle, those ancient councils, such as the Council of Nice, of\nConstantinople, the first of Ephesus, that of Chalcedon, and others like\nthem, which were held for the condemnation of errors, we cheerfully\nreceive and reverence as sacred, as far as respects the articles of\nfaith which they have defended; for they contain nothing but the pure\nand natural interpretation of the Scripture, which the holy fathers,\nwith spiritual prudence, applied to the discomfiture of the enemies of\nreligion who arose in those days. In some of the succeeding councils,\nlikewise, we discover a true zeal for piety, and evident proofs of\nsense, learning, and prudence. But as the progress of the world is\ngenerally from worse to worse, it is easy to see, from the more recent\ncouncils, how much the Church has gradually degenerated from the purity\nof that golden age. Even in these more corrupt ages, I doubt not, the\ncouncils have been partly composed of some bishops of a better\ncharacter; but the same observation may be applied to their acts, which\nwas formerly made in a way of complaint against the decrees of the Roman\nsenate, by the senators themselves. Where opinions prevail according to\ntheir number, and not according to the weight of argument by which they\nare supported, the better part of the assembly must of necessity be\nfrequently overcome by the majority. And councils have certainly issued\nmany impious decrees. It is unnecessary here to produce particular\nexamples, as well because this would carry us to too great a length, as\nbecause it has already been done by others with a diligence which\nscarcely admits of any addition.\nIX. Now, what need is there to enumerate the repugnances between\ncouncils and councils, and how decrees passed by one have been rescinded\nby another? Here it must not be alleged, that where there is such\nvariance between two councils, one or the other is not legitimate. For\nhow shall we determine this? The only way I know, is to ascertain from\nthe Scriptures that its decrees are not orthodox; for there is no other\ncertain rule of decision. It is now about nine hundred years ago, that\nthe Council of Constantinople, assembled under the emperor Leo, decreed\nthat all images placed in churches should be thrown down and broken in\npieces. Soon after, the Council of Nice, which the empress Irene\nconvened in opposition to the former, decreed that they should be\nrestored. Which of these two shall we acknowledge as a legitimate\ncouncil? This character has generally been attributed to the latter,\nwhich gave images a place in the Churches. But Augustine declares that\nthis cannot be done without imminent danger of idolatry. Epiphanius, a\nmore ancient writer, expresses himself in terms of much greater\nseverity; he says that it is abominable wickedness for images to be seen\nin the temples of Christians. Would the fathers who speak in this manner\napprove of that council, if they were now living? But if the accounts of\nhistorians be true, and credit be given to the acts themselves, that\ncouncil not only admitted of images, but determined that they were to be\nworshipped. Now, it is evident that such a decree must have originated\nfrom Satan. What shall we say to their perversions and mutilations of\nthe Scripture, which demonstrate that they held it all in contempt, as I\nhave already proved? We shall never be able to discriminate between the\nnumerous councils, which dissent from and contradict each other, unless\nwe examine them all by the word of God, which is the universal standard\nfor men and angels. On this ground, we reject the second Council of\nEphesus, and receive the Council of Chalcedon, because the latter\ncouncil condemned the impiety of Eutyches, which the former had\nsanctioned. This judgment of the Council of Chalcedon was formed from\nthe Scriptures by holy men, whom we imitate in forming our judgment, as\nthe word of God which enlightened them continues to give light to us.\nNow, let the Romanists go and boast, as they are accustomed to do, that\nthe Holy Spirit is inseparably attached to their councils.\nX. Even in the earliest and purest councils, however, there is something\nto complain of—either that the bishops who composed them, though men of\nlearning and prudence, being perplexed with the subjects immediately\nbefore them, did not extend their views to many other things; or that\nwhile they were occupied with more weighty and serious concerns, things\nof inferior moment escaped their notice; or merely that, being men, they\nwere liable to ignorance and error; or that they were sometimes hurried\ninto precipitancy by the violence of their passions. Of the truth of the\nlast observation, which seems the severest of all, there is a remarkable\nexample in the Council of Nice; the dignity of which has been\nuniversally and justly held in the highest veneration. For though the\nprincipal article of our faith was endangered, and they had to contend\nwith Arius, the enemy of it, who was there in readiness for the\ncontest,—though it was of the greatest importance that harmony should be\nmaintained among those who came with a design to confute the error of\nArius,—notwithstanding that, careless of such great dangers, forgetful\nof gravity, modesty, and every thing like good manners, dropping the\ncontroversy between them, as if they had assembled with an express view\nto the gratification of Arius, they began to counteract themselves with\nintestine dissensions, and to direct against each other the pen which\nought to have been employed against Arius. The foulest accusations were\nheard, defamatory libels were circulated, and there would have been no\nend of the contentions till they had murdered one another, if it had not\nbeen for the interference of the emperor Constantine, who protested that\na scrutiny into their lives was a thing beyond his cognizance, and\nrepressed this intemperate conduct with praise rather than with censure.\nIn how many instances is it probable that errors were committed by other\nsucceeding councils? Nor does this require any long proof; for whoever\nperuses their acts, will discover many infirmities, not to mention any\nthing worse.\nXI. And Leo, the Roman pontiff, hesitates not to bring a charge of\nambition and inconsiderate temerity against the Council of Chalcedon,\nwhich he at the same time acknowledges to have been orthodox in points\nof doctrine. He does not deny it to have been a legitimate council, but\nhe unequivocally asserts that it was possible for it to err. It may be\nthought, perhaps, that I betray a want of judgment in taking pains to\npoint out such errors; since our adversaries confess that councils might\nerr in things not essential to salvation. This labour, however, is not\nunnecessary. For though they find themselves obliged to confess this in\nwords, yet when they obtrude upon us the decision of every council on\nevery subject, without any discrimination, as an oracle of the Holy\nSpirit, they require of us, in fact, more than they had first assumed.\nWhat is the language of such conduct, but that councils cannot err, or\nthat, if they do err, it is unlawful for us to discover the truth, or to\nrefuse assent to errors? And I intend to draw no other conclusion from\nthese facts, than that the Holy Spirit governed pious and Christian\ncouncils in such a manner, as at the same time to permit them to betray\nsomething of human infirmity, that we might not place too much\nconfidence in men. This sentiment is far more favourable than that of\nGregory of Nazianzum, “that he never saw a good end of any council.” For\nhe who affirms that all without exception terminated ill, leaves them\nbut little authority. It is unnecessary here to take distinct notice of\nprovincial councils, since it is easy to judge from the general\ncouncils, what authority they ought to possess in framing articles of\nfaith, and receiving whatever kind of doctrine they pleased.\nXII. But our Romanists, when they find all the supports of reason fail\nthem in the defence of their cause, have recourse to that last and\nwretched subterfuge—That although the persons themselves betray the\ngreatest stupidity in their understandings and pleas, and act from the\nmost iniquitous motives and designs, still the word of God remains,\nwhich commands us to obey our governors.[963] But what if I deny that\nsuch persons are our governors? For they ought not to arrogate to\nthemselves more than belonged to Joshua, who was a prophet of the Lord\nand an excellent pastor. Now, let us hear with what language he was\ninaugurated into his office by the Lord: “This book of the law shall not\ndepart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night:\nturn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest\nprosper whithersoever thou goest.”[964] We shall consider them as our\nspiritual governors, therefore, who deviate not from the word of God,\neither to the right hand or to the left. If the doctrine of all pastors\nought to be received without any hesitation, why have we such frequent\nand earnest admonitions from the mouth of the Lord himself, not to\nlisten to the speeches of false prophets? “Hearken not,” says he by\nJeremiah, “unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you; they\nmake you vain; they speak a vision of their own hearts, and not out of\nthe mouth of the Lord.”[965] Again: “Beware of false prophets, which\ncome to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening\nwolves.”[966] The exhortation given us by John would also have been\nuseless: “Try the spirits, whether they are of God;”[967] though from\nthis examination the very angels are not exempted, much less Satan with\nall his falsehoods. How are we to understand this caution of our Lord?\n“If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”[968] Does\nit not sufficiently declare, that it is of the highest importance what\nkind of pastors are heard, and that they are not all entitled to the\nsame attention? Wherefore there is no reason why they should overawe us\nwith their titles, to make us partakers of their blindness, while we\nsee, on the contrary, that the Lord has taken peculiar care to deter us\nfrom suffering ourselves to be seduced by the error of other men, under\nwhatever mask or name it may be concealed. For if the answer of Christ\nbe true, all blind guides, whether they are denominated priests,\nprelates, or pontiffs, can do nothing but precipitate their followers\ninto the same ruin with themselves. Impressed, therefore, by these\nwarnings, both of precepts and of examples, no names of pastors,\nbishops, or councils, which are as capable of being falsely claimed as\nrightly assumed, ought ever to prevent us from examining all the spirits\nby the rule of the Divine word, in order to “try whether they are of\nGod.”\nXIII. Having proved that the Church has received no power to frame any\nnew doctrine, let us now speak of the power which our opponents\nattribute to it in the interpretation of the Scripture. We have not the\nleast objection to admit, that if a controversy arise respecting any\ndoctrine, there is no better or more certain remedy than to assemble a\ncouncil of true bishops, in which the controverted doctrine may be\ndiscussed. For such a decision, formed by the common consent of the\npastors of the Churches, after an invocation of the Spirit of Christ,\nwill have far greater weight, than if every one of them separately were\nto maintain it in preaching to his people, or if it were the result of a\nprivate conference between a few individuals. Besides, when bishops are\ncollected in one assembly, they deliberate together with greater\nadvantage on what they ought to teach, and the manner in which their\ninstructions should be conveyed, so as to guard against offence arising\nfrom diversity. In the third place, Paul prescribes this method of\ndetermining respecting doctrines. For while he attributes to every\ndistinct Church a power “to judge,”[969] he shows what ought to be the\norder of proceeding in more important cases; namely, that the Churches\nshould undertake the common cognizance of them. And so the dictate of\npiety itself teaches us, that if any one disturb the Church with a new\ndoctrine, and the matter be carried so far as to cause danger of a more\ngrievous dissension, the Churches should first assemble, should examine\nthe question proposed to them, and after a sufficient discussion of it,\nshould announce a decision taken from the Scriptures, which would put an\nend to all doubt among the people, and shut the mouths of refractory and\nambitious persons, so as to check their further presumption. Thus, when\nArius arose, the Council of Nice was assembled, and by its authority\ndefeated the pernicious attempts of that impious man, restored peace to\nthe Churches which he had disturbed, and asserted the eternal deity of\nChrist in opposition to his sacrilegious dogma. Some time after, when\nEunomius and Macedonius raised new contentions, their frenzy was opposed\nwith a similar remedy by the Council of Constantinople. The impiety of\nNestorius was condemned in the first Council of Ephesus. In short, this\nhas been the ordinary method of the Church from the beginning, for the\npreservation of unity, whenever Satan has begun to make any attempt\nagainst it. But let it be remembered, that neither every age, nor every\nplace, can produce an Athanasius, a Basil, a Cyril, and other such\nchampions of the true doctrine, as the Lord raised up at those periods.\nLet it also be recollected what happened at the second Council of\nEphesus, in which the heresy of Eutyches prevailed. Flavianus, a bishop\nof irreproachable memory, was banished, together with other pious men,\nand many similar enormities were committed, because it was Dioscorus, a\nfactious and ill-disposed man, and not the Spirit of the Lord, that\npresided in that council. But that council, it will be said, was not the\nChurch. I admit it: for I am firmly persuaded of this, that the truth is\nnot extinct in the Church, though it may be oppressed by one council,\nbut that it is wonderfully preserved by the Lord, to arise and triumph\nagain in his own time. But I deny it to be an invariable rule, that\nevery interpretation which may have been approved by a council is the\ntrue and certain sense of the Scripture.\nXIV. But the Romanists have a further design in maintaining that\ncouncils possess the power of interpreting the Scripture, and that\nwithout appeal. For it is a false pretence, when every thing that has\nbeen determined in councils is called an interpretation of the\nScripture. Of purgatory, the intercession of saints, auricular\nconfession, and similar fooleries, the Scriptures contain not a single\nsyllable. But, because all these things have been sanctioned by the\nauthority of councils, or, to speak more correctly, have been admitted\ninto the general belief and practice, therefore every one of them is to\nbe taken for an interpretation of Scripture. And not only so; but if a\ncouncil determine in direct opposition to the Scripture, it will still\nbe called an interpretation of it. Christ commands all to drink of the\ncup which he presents to them in the sacred supper.[970] The Council of\nConstance prohibited it to be given to the laity, and determined that\nnone but the priest should drink of it. Yet this, which is so\ndiametrically repugnant to the institution of Christ, they wish us to\nreceive as an interpretation of it. Paul calls “forbidding to marry” a\n“doctrine of devils;”[971] and the Holy Spirit, in another place,\npronounces that “marriage is honourable in all, and the bed\nundefiled.”[972] The prohibition, which they have since denounced, of\nthe marriage of priests, they wish us to consider as the true and\nnatural interpretation of the Scriptures, though nothing can be imagined\nmore repugnant to it. If any one dare to open his mouth to the contrary,\nhe is condemned as a heretic, because the determination of the Church is\nwithout appeal, and the truth of its interpretation cannot be doubted\nwithout impiety. What further requires to be urged against such\nconsummate effrontery? The mere exhibition of it is a sufficient\nrefutation. Their pretensions to confirm the Scripture by the authority\nof the Church, I purposely pass over. To subject the oracles of God to\nthe authority of men, so as to make their validity dependent on human\napprobation, is a blasphemy unworthy of being mentioned; beside which, I\nhave touched on this subject already. I will only ask them one question:\nIf the authority of the Scripture be founded on the approbation of the\nChurch, what decree of any council can they allege to this point? I\nbelieve, none at all. Why, then, did Arius suffer himself to be\nvanquished at Nice by testimonies adduced from the Gospel of John?\nAccording to the argument of our opponents, he was at liberty to reject\nthem, as not having yet received the approbation of any general council.\nThey allege an ancient catalogue, which is called the Canon of\nScripture, and which they say proceeded from the decision of the Church.\nI ask them again, in what council that canon was composed. To this they\ncan make no reply. Yet I would wish to be further informed, what kind of\na canon they suppose it to be. For I see that the ancient writers were\nnot fully agreed respecting it. And if any weight be attached to the\ntestimony of Jerome, the two books of the Maccabees, the history of\nTobit, Ecclesiasticus, and other books, will be considered as\napocryphal; to which our opponents will by no means consent.\nFootnote 944:\nMatt. xviii. 20.\nFootnote 945:\nDeut. iv. 2.

          "title": "CHAPTER X.",
          "content": "THE POWER OF LEGISLATION, IN WHICH THE POPE AND HIS ADHERENTS HAVE MOST\nCRUELLY TYRANNIZED OVER THE MINDS, AND TORTURED THE BODIES, OF MEN.\nWe now proceed to the second branch of the power of the Church, which\nthe Romanists represent as consisting in legislation—a source from which\nhave issued innumerable human traditions, the most pestilent and fatal\nto wretched souls. For they have made no more scruple than the scribes\nand Pharisees to “lay on other men’s shoulders burdens which they\nthemselves would not touch with one of their fingers.”[973] I have shown\nin another place the extreme cruelty of their injunctions concerning\nauricular confession. None of their other laws discover such enormous\nviolence; but those which appear the most tolerable of them all, are\ntyrannically oppressive to the conscience. I forbear to remark how they\nadulterate the worship of God, and despoil God himself, who is the sole\nLegislator, of the right which belongs to him. This power is now to be\nexamined—whether the Church has authority to make laws which shall bind\nthe consciences of men. This question has nothing to do with political\norder; the only objects of our present attention are, that God may be\nrightly worshipped according to the rule he has prescribed, and that our\nspiritual liberty which relates to God may be preserved entire. Whatever\nedicts have been issued by men respecting the worship of God,\nindependently of his word, it has been customary to call _human\ntraditions_. Against such laws we contend, and not against the holy and\nuseful constitutions of the Church, which contribute to the preservation\nof discipline, or integrity, or peace. The object for which we contend,\nis, to restrain that overgrown and barbarous empire, which is usurped\nover men’s souls by those who wish to be accounted the pastors of the\nChurch, but who in reality are its most savage butchers. For they say\nthat the laws which they make are spiritual, pertaining to the soul, and\nthey affirm them to be necessary to eternal life. Thus, as I have lately\nhinted, the kingdom of Christ is invaded; thus the liberty given by him\nto the consciences of believers is altogether subverted and destroyed. I\nforbear to remark at present with what great impiety they enforce the\nobservance of their laws, while they teach men to seek the pardon of\ntheir sins and righteousness and salvation from it, and while they make\nthe whole of religion and piety to consist in it. I only contend for\nthis one point, that no necessity ought to be imposed upon consciences\nin things in which they have been set at liberty by Christ; and without\nthis liberty, as I have before observed, they can have no peace with\nGod. They must acknowledge Christ their Deliverer as their only King,\nand must be governed by one law of liberty, even the sacred word of the\ngospel, if they wish to retain the grace which they have once obtained\nin Christ; they must submit to no slavery; they must be fettered by no\nbonds.\nII. These sapient legislators, indeed, pretend that their constitutions\nare laws of liberty, an easy yoke, a light burden. But who does not see\nthat these are gross falsehoods? The hardship of their laws is not at\nall felt by themselves, who have rejected the fear of God, and securely\nand boldly disregard all laws, human and divine. But persons who are\nimpressed with any concern for their salvation, are far from considering\nthemselves at liberty as long as they are entangled in these snares. We\nsee what great caution Paul used in this respect, to avoid “casting a\nsnare upon” men in a single instance;[974] and that not without cause;\nfor he saw what a deep wound would be made in their consciences, by the\nimposition of any necessity upon them in those things in which the Lord\nhad left them at liberty. On the contrary, it is scarcely possible to\nenumerate the constitutions, which these men have most rigorously\nenforced with the denunciation of eternal death, and which they require\nto be most minutely observed as necessary to salvation. Among these,\nthere are many exceedingly difficult to be fulfilled; but when they are\nall collected together in one body, so immense is the accumulation, the\nobservance of the whole is utterly impracticable. How, then, can it be\npossible for those who are loaded with such a vast weight of difficulty,\nnot to be perplexed and tortured with extreme anxiety and terror? My\ndesign at present, then, is, to oppose constitutions of this kind, which\ntend to bind souls internally before God, and to fill them with\nscruples, as if they enjoined things necessary to salvation.\nIII. The generality of men, therefore, are embarrassed with this\nquestion, for want of distinguishing with sufficient exactness between\nthe outward judgment of men and the court of conscience. The difficulty\nis increased by the injunction of Paul, that the magistrate is to be\nobeyed, “not only for wrath, but also for conscience’ sake;”[975] whence\nit follows, that consciences are bound by political laws. If this were\nthe case, all that we said in the last chapter, and are about to say in\nthis, on the subject of spiritual government, would fall to the ground.\nTo solve this difficulty, it is first of all necessary to understand\nwhat is conscience. The definition may be derived from the etymology of\nthe word. _Science_, or _knowledge_, is the apprehension which men have\nof things in their mind and understanding. So, when they have an\napprehension of the judgment of God, as a witness that suffers them not\nto conceal their sins, but forces them as criminals before the tribunal\nof the judge, this apprehension is called _conscience_. For it is\nsomething between God and man, which permits not a man to suppress what\nhe knows within himself, but pursues him till it brings him to a sense\nof his guilt. This is what Paul means, when he speaks of men’s\n“conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while\naccusing, or else excusing, one another”[976] before God. A simple\nknowledge might remain in man, as it were, in a state of concealment.\nTherefore this sentiment, which places men before the tribunal of God,\nis like a keeper appointed over man to watch and observe all his\nsecrets, that nothing may remain buried in darkness. Hence that old\nproverb, that conscience is equal to a thousand witnesses. For the same\nreason, Peter speaks of “the answer of a good conscience towards\nGod,”[977] to denote our tranquillity of mind, when, persuaded of the\ngrace of Christ, we present ourselves before God without fear. And the\nauthor of the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of persons “having no more\nconscience of sins,”[978] to signify their being liberated, or absolved,\nso as to feel no more remorse or compunction for sin.\nIV. Therefore, as works have respect to man, so the conscience is\nreferred to God. A good conscience is no other than an internal purity\nof heart. In this sense Paul says that “the end of the commandment is\ncharity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith\nunfeigned.”[979] In a subsequent part of the same chapter, he shows how\nwidely it differs from simple knowledge, when he says, that “some having\nput away a good conscience, concerning faith have made shipwreck.”[980]\nFor in these words he implies that it is a lively zeal for the worship\nof God, and a sincere desire and endeavour to live a pious and holy\nlife. Sometimes, indeed, it is likewise extended to men, as when Luke\nstates Paul to have made this declaration—“I exercise myself, to have\nalways a conscience void of offence toward God and toward men.”[981] The\napostle expressed himself in this manner, because the benefits\nproceeding from a good conscience do reach even to man. But strictly\nspeaking, the conscience has respect to God alone, as I have already\nobserved. Hence it is, that a law is said to bind the conscience, which\nsimply binds a man without any observation or consideration of other\nmen. For example, God not only commands the heart to be preserved chaste\nand pure from every libidinous desire, but prohibits all obscenity of\nlanguage and external lasciviousness. My conscience is bound to observe\nthis law, even though not another man existed in the world. The person,\ntherefore, who commits any breach of chastity, not only sins by setting\na bad example to his brethren, but brings his conscience into a state of\nguilt before God. The case of things, in themselves indifferent, stands\nnot on the same ground; for we ought to abstain from whatever is likely\nto give offence, but with a free conscience. Thus Paul speaks of meat\nconsecrated to idols: “If any man say unto you, This is offered in\nsacrifice to idols, eat not for his sake, and for conscience’ sake.\nConscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other.”[982] A faithful\nman, who, after previous admonition, should eat such meat, would be\nguilty of sin. But though such abstinence is enjoined on him by God as\nnecessary on account of his brother, he still retains his liberty of\nconscience. We see how this law, while it binds the external act, leaves\nthe conscience free.\nV. Let us now return to human laws. If they are designed to introduce\nany scruple into our minds, as though the observance of them were\nessentially necessary, we assert, that they are unreasonable impositions\non the conscience. For our consciences have to do, not with men, but\nwith God alone. And this is the meaning of the well known distinction,\nmaintained in the schools, between a human tribunal and the court of\nconscience. When the whole world was enveloped in the thickest shades of\nignorance, this little spark of light still remained unextinguished, so\nthat they acknowledged the conscience of man to be superior to all human\njudgments. It is true that what they confessed in one word, they\nafterwards overturned in fact; yet it was the will of God that even at\nthat time there should remain some testimony in favour of Christian\nliberty, to rescue the conscience from the tyranny of men. But we have\nnot yet solved the difficulty which arises from the language of Paul.\nFor if princes are to be obeyed, “not only for wrath, but also for\nconscience’ sake,”[983] it seems to follow, that the laws of princes\nhave dominion over the conscience. If this be true, the same must be\naffirmed of the laws of the Church. I reply, In the first place, it is\nnecessary to distinguish between the _genus_ and the _species_. For the\nconscience is not affected by every particular law; yet we are bound by\nthe general command of God, which establishes the authority of\nmagistrates. And this is the hinge upon which Paul’s argument turns,\nthat magistrates are to be honoured because they are “ordained of\nGod.”[984] At the same time he is far from insinuating that the laws\nenacted by them have any thing to do with the internal government of the\nsoul; for he every where extols the service of God and the spiritual\nrule of a holy life, above all the statutes and decrees of men. A second\nconsideration worthy of notice, which is a consequence of the first, is,\nthat human laws,—I mean such as are good and just, whether enacted by\nmagistrates or by the Church,—though they are necessary to be observed,\nare not on this account binding on the conscience; because all the\nnecessity of observing them has reference to the general object of laws,\nbut does not consist in the particular things which are commanded. There\nis an immense distance between laws of this description, and those which\nprescribe any new form for the worship of God, and impose a necessity in\nthings that were left free and indifferent.\nVI. Such are the _Ecclesiastical Constitutions_, as they are now called,\nin the Papacy, which are obtruded as necessary to the true worship of\nGod; and as they are innumerable, they are so many bonds to entrap and\ninsnare souls. Though we have touched on them a little in the exposition\nof the law, yet as this is a more suitable place to discuss them at\nlarge, I shall now endeavour to collect a summary of the whole, in the\nbest order I can. And as we have already said what appeared sufficient\nrespecting the tyrannical power, which the false bishops arrogate to\nthemselves, of teaching whatever doctrines they please, I shall at\npresent pass over all that subject, and confine myself to a discussion\nof the power which they say they have, to make laws. Our false bishops,\ntherefore, burden men’s consciences with new laws under this\npretext—that the Lord has constituted them spiritual legislators, by\ncommitting to them the government of the Church. Wherefore they contend,\nthat all the commands and ordinances ought of necessity to be observed\nby all Christian people, and that whoever violates them is guilty of\ndouble disobedience, because he is a rebel both against God and the\nChurch. Certainly, if they were true bishops, I would allow them some\nauthority of this kind; not all that they demand, but all that is\nrequisite to the maintenance of good order in the Church. But as they\nbear no resemblance of the character to which they pretend, the least\nthey can possibly assume is more than their right. Yet as this has been\nalready proved, let us admit the supposition at present, that whatever\npower true bishops are entitled to, belongs to them. Still I deny that\nthey are therefore appointed as legislators over believers, with power\nto prescribe a rule of life according to their own pleasure, or to\nconstrain the people committed to them to submit to their decrees. By\nthis observation I mean, that they have no authority to enjoin upon the\nobservance of the Church any thing that they may have invented\nthemselves, independently of the word of God. As this power was unknown\nto the apostles, and was so frequently interdicted to the ministers of\nthe Church by the mouth of the Lord, I wonder how they have dared to\nusurp it, and still dare to maintain it contrary to the example of the\napostles, and in defiance of the express prohibition of God.\nVII. Every thing pertaining to the perfect rule of a holy life, the Lord\nhas comprehended in his law, so that there remains nothing for men to\nadd to that summary. And he has done this, first, that, since all\nrectitude of life consists in the conformity of all our actions to his\nwill, as their standard, we might consider him as the sole Master and\nDirector of our conduct; and secondly, to show that he requires of us\nnothing more than obedience. For this reason, James says, “He that\njudgeth his brother, judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou\nart not a doer of the law, but a judge. There is one lawgiver, who is\nable to save and to destroy.”[985] We hear that God asserts this as his\npeculiar and exclusive prerogative; to govern us by the empire and laws\nof his word. And the same sentiment had before been expressed by Isaiah,\nthough in terms not quite so explicit: “The Lord is our Judge, the Lord\nis our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will save us.”[986] Both\npassages imply, that he who has authority over the soul, is the Arbiter\nof life and death; and James even clearly expresses it. No man can\nassume this to himself. It follows therefore, that God ought to be\nacknowledged as the only King of souls, who alone has power to save and\nto destroy, or, in the language of Isaiah, as the King, Judge,\nLegislator, and Saviour. Wherefore Peter, when he admonishes pastors of\ntheir duty, exhorts them “to feed the flock, not as being lords over\nGod’s heritage,”[987] or the company of believers. If we duly consider\nthis point, that it is not lawful to transfer to man that which God\nappropriates solely to himself, we shall understand that this cuts off\nall the power which is claimed by those who wish to exalt themselves to\ncommand any thing in the Church, unsanctioned by the word of God.\nVIII. Now, as the whole argument rests here, that, if God is the sole\nlegislator, it is not lawful for men to assume this honour to\nthemselves,—we ought also to bear in mind the two reasons which we have\nstated, why God asserts this exclusively to himself. The first is, that\nhis will may be received as the perfect rule of all righteousness and\nholiness, and so that an acquaintance with it may be all the knowledge\nnecessary to a good life. The second is, that with respect to the mode\nof worshipping him aright, he may exercise the sole empire over our\nsouls, to whom we are under the strongest obligation to obey his\nauthority and await his commands. When these two reasons are kept in\nview, it will be easy to judge what constitutions of men are contrary to\nthe word of God. Now, of this description are all those which are\npretended to belong to the true worship of God, and to be obligatory on\nmen’s consciences as necessary to be observed. Let us remember,\ntherefore, that all human laws are to be weighed in this balance, if we\nwould have a certain and infallible test. The first of these reasons is\nurged by Paul in his Epistle to the Colossians, in opposition to the\nfalse apostles, who endeavoured to oppress the Churches with fresh\nburdens. In a similar argument, in the Epistle to the Galatians, he\ninsists more on the second reason. In the Epistle to the Colossians, he\ncontends that the doctrine of the true worship of God is not to be\nsought from men, because the Lord has faithfully and fully instructed us\nhow we ought to worship him. To prove this, in the first chapter he\nstates that all the wisdom by which the man of God is made perfect in\nChrist is contained in the gospel. In the beginning of the second\nchapter, he declares that “in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom\nand knowledge;” from which he concludes that believers should “beware\nlest any man spoil them through philosophy and vain deceit, after the\ntradition of men.” At the end of the chapter, he still more confidently\ncondemns all “will worship;”[988] this includes all those fictitious\nservices which men either invent for themselves or receive from others,\ntogether with all the precepts by which they presume to regulate the\nworship of God. Thus we have ascertained the impiety of all those\nconstitutions, in the observance of which the worship of God is\npretended to consist. The passages in the Epistle to the Galatians, in\nwhich he argues that snares ought not to be imposed on consciences,\nwhich are subject to the government of God alone, are too plain to be\nmistaken; especially in the fifth chapter.[989] It will therefore be\nsufficient to have mentioned them.\nIX. But as the whole of this subject will be better elucidated by\nexamples, before I proceed any further, it will be useful to apply this\ndoctrine to our own times. We affirm that the Ecclesiastical\nConstitutions, with which the pope and his satellites oppress the\nChurch, are pernicious and impious; our adversaries assert them to be\nholy and useful. Now, they are of two classes: some regard rites and\nceremonies, others have more relation to discipline. Is there just\ncause, then, to induce us to reject both? There certainly is juster\ncause than we would desire. In the first place, do not the authors of\nthem explicitly declare that the very essence of the worship of God\nconsists in them? To what end do they refer their ceremonies, but that\nGod may be worshipped through them? And this arises not from the mere\nerror of the uninformed multitude, but from the approbation of those who\nsustain the office of teachers. I am not yet referring to the gross\nabominations by which they have attempted to overturn all piety; but\nthey would never pretend a failure in any one of the most insignificant\ntraditions to be such an atrocious crime, unless they made the worship\nof God subject to their inventions. Wherein are we guilty of any\noffence, then, if we cannot bear in our day what was declared to be\nintolerable by Paul: namely, that the legitimate mode of worshipping God\nshould be regulated by the will of men; especially when they enjoin a\nworship “after the rudiments of the world,” which Paul asserts to be\n“not after Christ.”[990] It is well known also, with what rigorous\nnecessity they bind men’s consciences to observe every thing that they\ncommand. In our opposition to this, we unite in a common cause with\nPaul, who would by no means allow the consciences of believers to be\nsubjected to the bondage of men.[991]\nX. Moreover, this worst of consequences ensues; that when men have begun\nto place religion in such vain figments, that perversion is immediately\nfollowed by another execrable corruption, with which Christ reproached\nthe Pharisees. “Ye have made the commandment of God of none effect by\nyour tradition.”[992] I will not combat our modern legislators with my\nown words; I will grant them the victory, if they can vindicate\nthemselves from this accusation of Christ. But how can they vindicate\nthemselves, while they esteem it infinitely more criminal, to have\nomitted auricular confession at a stated time of the year, than to have\nlived a most iniquitous life for a whole year together; to have infected\nthe tongue with the least taste of animal food on a Friday, than to have\npolluted the whole body by committing fornication every day; to have put\na hand to any honest labour on a day consecrated to any pretended saint,\nthan to have continually employed all the members in the most flagitious\nactions; for a priest to be connected in one lawful marriage, than to be\ndefiled with a thousand adulteries; to have failed of performing one vow\nof pilgrimage, than to violate every other promise; not to have lavished\nany thing on the enormous, superfluous, and useless magnificence of\nChurches, than to have failed of relieving the most pressing necessities\nof the poor; to have passed by an idol without some token of honour,\nthan to have insulted all the men in the world; not to have muttered\nover, at certain seasons, a multitude of words without any meaning, than\nto have never offered a genuine prayer from the heart? What is it for\nmen to make the commandment of God of none effect by their traditions,\nif this be not? When coldly and carelessly recommending the observance\nof the commandments of God, they insist on an exact obedience to their\nown, with as much zeal and anxiety as if the whole essence of piety\nconsisted in them; when avenging the violation of the Divine law with\nslight penalties of satisfactions, they punish the smallest\ntransgression of one of their decrees with nothing less than\nimprisonment, banishment, fire, or sword; when less severe and\ninexorable against the despisers of God, they persecute the despisers of\nthemselves with implacable hatred even to death; and when they instruct\nall those whom they hold in the chains of ignorance in such a manner,\nthat they would feel less concern at seeing the subversion of the whole\nlaw of God, than the violation of the smallest tittle of the commands of\nthe Church? In the first place, here is a grievous error, that on\naccount of things of no importance in themselves, and left free by God,\none man despises, condemns, and rejects another. Now, as if this were\nnot bad enough, “the beggarly elements of the world,”[993] as Paul calls\nthem, are esteemed of more force than the celestial oracles of God. He\nwho is absolved in adultery, is condemned in meat; he who is allowed a\nharlot, is interdicted from a wife. This is the fruit of that\nprevaricating obedience, which recedes from God in proportion as it\ninclines to men.\nXI. There are also two other faults, far from small ones, which we\ncharge on these Constitutions. The first is, that they prescribe for the\nmost part useless, and sometimes even foolish observances. The second\nis, that pious consciences are oppressed with the immense number of\nthem, and being carried back to a species of Judaism, are so occupied\nwith shadows as to be prevented from coming to Christ. When I call these\nobservances useless and foolish, I know this will not be admitted by the\nwisdom of the flesh, which is so pleased with them, as to consider the\nChurch altogether deformed where they are abolished. But these are the\nthings which Paul describes as “having a show of wisdom in will-worship,\nand humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the\nsatisfying of the flesh.”[994] This is certainly a most salutary\nadmonition, which ought never to be forgotten by us. Human traditions,\nhe says, deceive under a show of wisdom. Is it inquired whence they have\nthis appearance? I reply, that being contrived by man, the human mind\nrecognizes them as its own, and recognizing them, embraces them with\ngreater pleasure than it would any thing of the greatest excellence, but\nless agreeable to its vanity. A further recommendation of them is, that\nas they keep the minds of men depressed to the ground under their yoke,\nthey appear well adapted to promote humility. Lastly, they are regarded\nas the expedients of prudence, from their supposed tendency to restrain\ncorporeal indulgence, and to subdue sensuality by the rigour of\nabstinence. But what does Paul say to these things? Does he strip off\nsuch disguises, that the simple may not be deluded by false pretences?\nSatisfied that he had said enough to refute them, when he had called\nthem “the commandments and doctrines of men,”[995] he passes over all\nthese things as undeserving of any particular refutation. And knowing\nthat all services of human invention are condemned in the Church, and\nought to excite the suspicion of believers in proportion to the pleasure\nthey afford to the minds of men; knowing that false appearance of\nexternal humility to be at such an immense distance from true humility,\nthat it might be easily distinguished from it; knowing that discipline\nto be entitled to no other consideration than as a mere exercise of the\nbody,—he intended these very things, by which the traditions of men are\nrecommended to the ignorant, to serve as their refutation with\nbelievers.\nXII. So, at the present day, not only the unlearned vulgar, but those\nwho are most inflated with worldly wisdom, are universally and\nwonderfully captivated with the pomp of ceremonies. Hypocrites and silly\nwomen think it impossible to imagine any thing more beautiful or\nexcellent. But those who examine more minutely, and judge with more\naccuracy, according to the rule of piety, respecting the real value of\nthose numerous ceremonies, perceive, in the first place, that they are\nfrivolous, because they have no utility; and in the next place, that\nthey are delusive, because they deceive the eyes of the spectators with\nempty pomp. I speak of those ceremonies under which, the Roman doctors\ncontend, are concealed great mysteries, but which, on examination, we\nfind to be mere mockeries. And it is not to be wondered at, that the\nauthors and advocates of them have fallen into such folly as to delude\nboth themselves and others with contemptible absurdities; because they\nhave taken their model in some things from the reveries of the heathen,\nand in others, without any judgment, have imitated the ancient rites of\nthe Mosaic law, which were no more applicable to us than the sacrifices\nof animals and other similar ceremonies. Indeed, if there were no\nargument besides, yet no man in his senses would expect any thing good\nfrom such a heterogeneous compound. And the fact itself plainly\ndemonstrates, that numerous ceremonies have no other use than to stupefy\nthe people, instead of instructing them. So hypocrites attach great\nimportance to those novel canons, which overturn discipline rather than\npreserve it; for on a more accurate investigation, they will be found a\nmere shadow of discipline, without any reality.\nXIII. Now, to proceed to the other fault which I have mentioned, who\ndoes not see that traditions, by the continual accumulation of one upon\nanother, have grown to such an immense number, that they are altogether\nintolerable to the Christian Church? Hence it is, that the ceremonies\ndiscover a kind of Judaism, and other observances inflict grievous\ntortures on pious souls. Augustine complained that, in his time, the\ncommands of God were neglected, and every thing was so full of\npresumption, that a person was more severely censured for having touched\nthe ground with his bare feet within eight days of his baptism, than for\nhaving drowned his senses in intoxication. He complained that the\nChurch, which the mercy of God intended to place in a state of liberty,\nwas so grievously oppressed, that the condition of the Jews was more\ntolerable. If that holy man had lived in our day, with what lamentations\nwould he have deplored the present state of bondage? For the number of\nordinances is ten times greater, and every tittle is enforced with a\nhundred times more rigour, than in his time. Such is the general\nconsequence, when these corrupt legislators have seized the dominion,\nthey make no end of commands and prohibitions, till they arrive at such\nan extreme that obedience is scarcely if at all practicable. This is\nfinely expressed by Paul, when he says, “If ye be dead from the\nrudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye\nsubject to ordinances? Eat not, taste not, handle not.”[996] The word\nἁψη, signifying both to _eat_ and to _handle_, requires here to be\nunderstood in the former sense, to avoid an unnecessary repetition.\nHere, then, he most beautifully describes the progress of the false\napostles. They begin with superstition, forbidding to eat not only a\nlarge quantity, but even a little; when they have carried this point,\nthey next forbid to taste; and after this is submitted to them, they\npronounce it unlawful even to touch with a finger.\nXIV. In the present age, we justly censure this tyranny in human\nconstitutions, which astonishingly torments miserable consciences with\ninnumerable edicts, and the extreme rigour with which they are enforced.\nThe canons relating to discipline have been already considered. What\nshall I say of the ceremonies, which have half buried Christ, and caused\nus to return to Jewish figures? “Christ our Lord,” says Augustine, “has\nconnected together the society of the new people with sacraments, very\nfew in number, most excellent in signification, and very easy to\nobserve.” The immense distance of this simplicity from the multitude and\nvariety of rites in which we see the Church now involved, can hardly be\nstated in terms sufficiently strong. I know with what artifice some\ningenious men apologize for this corruption. They say, that there are\ngreat numbers among us as ignorant as there were among the Israelites;\nthat for their sakes such discipline was instituted, which those who are\nstronger, though they do not find it necessary, ought not to neglect,\nwhen they perceive it to be useful to their weak brethren. I reply, that\nwe are not ignorant of what is due from every Christian to the infirmity\nof his brethren; but, on the other hand, we reply, that this is not the\nway to benefit the weak, by oppressing them with heavy loads of\nceremonies. It was not without cause that the Lord has made this\ndifference between his ancient people and us; that he chose to instruct\nthem, like children, with emblems and figures, but has been pleased to\nteach us in a more simple manner, without such a large external\napparatus. As “a child,” says Paul, “is under tutors and governors until\nthe time appointed of the father,”[997] so the Jews were under the\ninstruction and government of the law. But we resemble adults, who,\nhaving left a state of tuition and guardianship, have no need of puerile\ndiscipline. Surely the Lord foresaw what sort of common people there\nwould be in his Church, and in what manner they would require to be\ngoverned. Yet he made the difference we have mentioned between us and\nthe Jews. It is a foolish way, therefore, to pretend to benefit the\nignorant by reviving Judaism, which has been abrogated by Christ. This\ndiversity, between the people under the old dispensation and the new,\nwas signified by Christ, when he said to the woman of Samaria, “The hour\ncometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father\nin spirit and in truth.”[998] This, indeed, had always been the case;\nbut the new worshippers differ from the ancient in this respect, that\nunder Moses the spiritual adoration of God was concealed, and in some\ndegree embarrassed with many ceremonies, which being now abolished, he\nis worshipped with greater simplicity. Wherefore those who confound this\ndifference, subvert the order instituted and established by Christ.\nShall no ceremonies, then, it will be asked, be given to the ignorant,\nto assist their weakness? I say no such thing; for I think some\nassistance of this kind very useful to them. I only contend that such\nmeans should be employed as would tend to make known Christ, not to\nconceal him. God has, therefore, given us few ceremonies, and those by\nno means laborious, to exhibit Christ to us as present; the Jews had a\ngreater number, to represent him as absent. He was then absent, I say,\nnot as to his power, but with respect to the manner of representing him.\nTherefore, to observe proper bounds, it is necessary to retain that\npaucity in number, that facility in observance, that dignity in\nsignification, which consists in simplicity. That this has not been\ndone, it is scarcely necessary to mention. The fact is visible to all.\nXV. Here I forbear to remark the pernicious opinions with which the\nminds of men are impressed, that these ceremonies of human invention are\nsacrifices by which God is justly appeased, by which sins are expiated,\nby which righteousness and salvation are procured. It will be denied\nthat things intrinsically good are corrupted by such adventitious\nerrors, since equal guilt of this kind may be incurred in the\nperformance of works commanded by God. But it is more intolerable to\nattribute so much honour to works presumptuously devised by the will of\nmen, as to believe them to be meritorious of eternal life. For works\ncommanded by God obtain a reward, because the Legislator himself accepts\nthem as acts of obedience. They derive their value, therefore, not from\ntheir own dignity or intrinsic merit, but from God’s estimation of our\nobedience to him. I speak here of that perfection of works which God\ncommands, but which men never attain. For the works of the law which we\nperform, are only accepted through the gratuitous goodness of God, our\nobedience in them being weak and imperfect. But as we are not here\ndiscussing the value of works independent of Christ, let us drop this\nquestion. With regard to the present argument, I again repeat, that\nwhatever value is attributed to works, they derive from the\nconsideration of the obedience, which is alone regarded by God, as he\ndeclares by the prophet: “I commanded not concerning burnt-offerings or\nsacrifices, but this thing I commanded, saying, Obey my voice.”[999] Of\nworks of human device, he speaks in another place. “Wherefore do ye\nspend money for that which is not bread?”[1000] Again: “In vain do they\nworship me by the precepts of men.”[1001] Our adversaries, therefore,\ncan never excuse themselves for suffering the unhappy people to seek in\nthose external fooleries a righteousness to present before God, and to\nsupport them at the heavenly tribunal. Besides, is it not a fault\ndeserving of severe reprehension, that they exhibit ceremonies not\nunderstood, like the scenery of a stage or a magical incantation? For it\nis certain that all ceremonies are corrupt and pernicious, unless they\ndirect men to Christ. Now, the ceremonies practised in the Papacy have\nno connection with doctrine: they confine men to mere signs, destitute\nof all signification. Lastly, so ingenious is cupidity, it is evident\nthat many of them have been invented by avaricious priests, merely as\ncontrivances for the extortion of money. But whatever be their origin,\nthey are all so prostituted to the acquisition of gain, that it is\nnecessary to abolish the principal part of them, if we wish to prevent a\nprofane and sacrilegious traffic from being carried on in the Church.\nXVI. Though I may be considered as not delivering a doctrine of\nperpetual application respecting human constitutions, because the\npreceding observations have been wholly directed to the present age, yet\nnothing has been advanced which would not be useful in all ages. For\nwherever this superstition intrudes, that men are determined to worship\nGod with their own inventions, all the laws made for this purpose\npresently degenerate into such gross abuses as we have described. It is\na curse which God denounces, not against any particular age, but against\nall ages, that he will strike with blindness and stupidity all those who\nworship him with the doctrines of men.[1002] The invariable effect of\nthis blindness is, that no absurdity is too great to be embraced by\npersons who, in contempt of so many warnings from God, wilfully entangle\nthemselves in such fatal snares. But if, irrespective of peculiar\ncircumstances, any one wish to have a simple statement, what are the\nhuman traditions of all ages, which ought to be rejected and reprobated\nby the Church and all pious persons, the direction we have already given\nis clear and certain—that they are all laws made by men without the word\nof God, for the purpose, either of prescribing any method for the\nworship of God, or of laying the conscience under a religious\nobligation, as if they enjoined things necessary to salvation. If either\nor both of these be accompanied with other faults, such as, that the\nceremonies, by their multitude, obscure the simplicity of the gospel;\nthat they tend to no edification, but are useless and ridiculous\noccupations rather than real exercises of piety; that they are employed\nfor the sordid purposes of dishonest gain; that they are too difficult\nto be observed; that they are polluted with impious superstitions;—these\nthings will further assist us in discovering the vast evil which they\ncontain.\nXVII. I hear the answer which they make—that their traditions are not\nfrom themselves, but from God; for that the Church is directed by the\nHoly Spirit, so that it cannot err; and that they are in possession of\nhis authority. When this point is gained, it immediately follows, that\ntheir traditions are the revelations of the Holy Spirit, which cannot be\ndespised without impiety and contempt of God. That they may not appear\nto attempt any thing without high authorities, they wish it to be\nbelieved that the greatest part of their observances have descended from\nthe apostles; and they contend that one example sufficiently shows what\nwas the conduct of the apostles in other cases; when, being assembled\ntogether in a council, they determined and announced to all Gentiles,\nthat they should “abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,\nand from things strangled.”[1003] We have already exposed the falsehood\nof their pretensions in arrogating to themselves the title of the\nChurch. With regard to the present argument, if, stripping off all false\ndisguises, we confine our attention to what ought to be our chief\nconcern, and involves our highest interests, namely, what kind of a\nChurch Christ requires, in order that we may conform ourselves to its\nstandard,—it will be sufficiently evident to us, that the name of the\nChurch does not belong to those who overleap all the limits of the word\nof God, and exercise an unbounded license of enacting new laws. For does\nnot that law, which was once given to the Church, remain forever in\nforce? “What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt\nnot add thereto, nor diminish from it.”[1004] And again: “Add not thou\nunto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.”[1005]\nSince they cannot deny these things to have been spoken to the Church,\ndo they not declare the rebellion of the Church, when they pretend that,\nnotwithstanding such prohibitions, it has dared to mingle additions of\nits own with the doctrine of God? Far be it from us, however, to\ncountenance their falsehoods, by which they do so great an injury to the\nChurch; let us know that the assumption of the name of the Church is a\nfalse pretence in all who are so carried away by the violence of human\npresumption, as to disregard all the restraints of the word of God, and\nto introduce a torrent of their own inventions. There is nothing\ninvolved, nothing intricate, nothing ambiguous in these words, by which\nthe whole Church is forbidden to add any thing to the word, or to\ndiminish any thing from it, in any question relating to the worship of\nGod and his salutary precepts. But it will be alleged, that this was\nspoken exclusively of the law, which has been succeeded by the\nprophecies and the whole dispensation of the gospel. This I certainly\nadmit, and at the same time assert, that these were accomplishments of\nthe law, rather than additions to it, or retrenchments of it. But if the\nLord suffered no enlargement or diminution of the ministry of Moses,\nnotwithstanding it was enveloped in such great obscurity, till he\ndispensed a clearer doctrine by his servants the prophets, and finally\nby his beloved Son,—why do not we consider ourselves far more severely\nprohibited from making any addition to the law, the prophets, the\npsalms, and the gospel? No change has taken place in the Lord, who long\nago declared that nothing was so highly offensive to him, as to attempt\nto worship him with the inventions of men. Hence those striking\ndeclarations in the prophets, which ought to be continually sounding in\nour ears: “I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day\nthat I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings\nor sacrifices; but this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice,\nand I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all\nthe ways that I have commanded you.”[1006] Again: “I earnestly protested\nunto your fathers, saying, Obey my voice.”[1007] There are many other\nsimilar passages, but the most remarkable of all is the following: “Hath\nthe Lord,” says Samuel, “as great delight in burnt-offerings and\nsacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is\nbetter than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For\nrebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity\nand idolatry.”[1008] Therefore, whatever human inventions relating to\nthe worship of God, may be defended by the authority of the Church,\nsince it is impossible to vindicate them from impiety, it is easy to\ninfer that the imputation of them to the Church has no foundation in\ntruth.\nXVIII. For this reason we freely censure that tyranny of human\ntraditions, which is imposed upon the world under the name of the\nChurch. Nor do we hold the Church in contempt, as our adversaries, in\norder to render us obnoxious, falsely assert. We allow it the praise of\nobedience, than which no higher praise can be given. On the contrary,\nthey are themselves the most outrageous violators of the Church, which\nthey represent as guilty of rebellion against the Lord, when they\npretend that it has gone beyond what was permitted by the word of God;\nto say nothing of the combination of impudence and wickedness discovered\nin their incessant vociferations respecting the authority of the Church,\nwhile they take no notice of the command of the Lord, or of the\nobedience due from the Church to that command. But if we desire, as we\nought, to agree with the Church, it will be best for us to observe and\nremember what commands are given by the Lord, equally to us and to the\nwhole Church, that we may all obey him with one consent. For there is no\ndoubt that we shall fully agree with the Church, if we show ourselves in\nall things obedient to the Lord. Now, to attribute to the apostles the\norigin of the traditions which have hitherto oppressed the Church, is a\nmere imposture; for the whole tendency of the doctrine of the apostles\nwas, that men’s consciences should not be burdened with new observances,\nor the worship of God contaminated with human inventions. Besides, if\nthere be any credit due to ancient histories and records, the apostles\nnot only never knew, but never even heard of that which is ascribed to\nthem. Nor let it be pretended, that the greatest part of their\nConstitutions were received in use and commonly practised, which were\nnever committed to writing; namely, those things which, during the life\nof Christ, they were not able to understand, but which after his\nascension, they learned from the revelation of the Holy Spirit. The\nmeaning of that passage we have already examined. With respect to the\npresent subject, we may observe, they make themselves truly ridiculous\nby maintaining that those great mysteries, which were so long unknown to\nthe apostles, consisted partly of Jewish or heathen ceremonies, of which\nthe former had long before been promulgated among the Jews, and the\nlatter among the heathen, and partly of foolish gesticulations and\nunmeaning rites, which stupid priests, who scarcely know how to walk or\nspeak, perform with the greatest exactness, and which even infants and\nfools counterfeit so well, that it might be thought there were no more\nsuitable ministers of such solemnities. If there were no histories, yet\nmen of sound judgment would conclude from the thing itself, that such a\nvast multitude of rites and observances did not break into the Church\nall on a sudden, but that they must have been introduced by degrees. For\nwhen those holy bishops, who were the immediate successors of the\napostles, had made some appointments relating to order and discipline,\nthey were followed by a series of others, who had too little\nconsideration, and too much curiosity and cupidity, of whom every one in\nsuccession vied with his predecessors, from a foolish emulation to excel\nthem in the invention of new observances. And because there was danger\nthat their inventions, by which they desired to obtain the praises of\nposterity, might in a short time be disused, they were the more rigid in\nenforcing the observance of them. This foolish and perverse imitation\nhas been the source of most of those rites which the Romanists urge upon\nus as apostolic. And this is also attested by various histories.\nXIX. To avoid too much prolixity in composing a catalogue of them all,\nwe shall content ourselves with one example. In the administration of\nthe Lord’s supper, the apostles used great simplicity. Their immediate\nsuccessors, to adorn the dignity of the mystery, added some forms which\nwere not to be altogether condemned. Afterwards followed those foolish\nimitators, who, by adding various fragments from time to time, at length\nformed those vestments of the priests, those ornaments of the altar,\nthose gesticulations, and all that apparatus of useless things, which we\nsee in the mass. But they object that it was an ancient opinion, that\nwhatever was done with the common consent of the universal Church, had\noriginated from the apostles. In proof of this, they cite the testimony\nof Augustine. I shall give them no other answer than in the words of\nAugustine himself. “Those things which are observed throughout the\nworld,” says he, “we may understand to have been ordained, either by the\napostles themselves, or by general councils, whose authority is very\nuseful in the Church; as that the sufferings, resurrection, and\nascension of our Lord, and the descent of the Holy Spirit, are\ncelebrated by solemn anniversaries; and if there be any thing else of a\nsimilar kind observed by the universal Church wherever it has extended\nitself.” When he enumerates so few examples, who does not see that he\nintended to attribute to authors worthy of credit and reverence the\nobservances which were then in use, and none but those simple, rare, and\nsober ones, which are useful in preserving the order of the Church? But\nhow distant is this passage from the conclusion the Roman doctors would\nextort from it, that there is not the most insignificant ceremony among\nthem which ought not to be considered as resting on the authority of the\napostles!\nXX. Not to be too tedious, I will produce only one example. If any one\ninquire whence they have their holy water, they immediately answer, From\nthe apostles. As if the histories did not attribute this invention to a\nbishop of Rome, who, if he had taken counsel of the apostles, would\ncertainly never have contaminated baptism by a strange and unseasonable\nsymbol. Though it does not appear to me probable that the origin of that\nconsecration was so ancient as those histories state. For the\nobservation of Augustine, that some Churches in his time rejected the\ncustom of washing the feet as a solemn imitation of Christ, lest that\nceremony might be supposed to have any reference to baptism, implies\nthat there was no other kind of washing then practised which bore any\nresemblance to baptism. Be this as it may, I shall never admit it to\nhave been a dictate of the spirit of the apostles, that baptism should\nbe recalled to the memory by a daily ablution, which would be little\nelse than a repetition of it. It is of no consequence that Augustine\nelsewhere ascribes other things also to the apostles; for as he has\nnothing but conjectures, no conclusion ought to be drawn from them on\nsuch an important subject. Lastly, though we should even grant, that\nthose things which he mentions had been transmitted from the time of the\napostles, yet there is a wide difference between instituting some pious\nexercise which believers may use with a free conscience, or if they find\nnot profitable, may abstain from the use of it, and making laws to\nentangle their consciences with bondage. But whoever was their author,\nsince we see that they have fallen into so great an abuse, nothing\nprevents our abolishing them without any disrespect to him; because they\nwere never instituted in order to be perpetual and unalterable.\nXXI. Nor does the cause of our adversaries derive much advantage from\ntheir attempt to excuse their own tyranny, by alleging the example of\nthe apostles. The apostles, they say, and elders of the primitive\nChurch, passed a decree without the command of Christ, enjoining all the\nGentiles to “abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and\nfrom things strangled.”[1009] If this was lawful for them, why may it\nnot be lawful for their successors, whenever circumstances require, to\nimitate their conduct? I sincerely wish they would imitate them in other\nthings as well as in this. For I deny that the apostles, on that\noccasion, instituted or decreed any thing new, as it is easy to prove by\na sufficient reason. For when Peter had declared in that assembly, that\nto “put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples” would be to “tempt\nGod,”[1010] he would have contradicted his own opinion, if he had\nafterwards consented to the imposition of any yoke. Yet there was a yoke\nimposed, if the apostles decreed, from their own authority, that the\nGentiles should be prohibited “from meats offered to idols, and from\nblood, and from things strangled.” There still remains some difficulty,\nthat nevertheless they seem to prohibit them. But this will be easily\nsolved, if we more closely examine the meaning of the decree itself; of\nwhich the first point in order and principal in importance is, that the\nGentiles were to be left in possession of their liberty, and not to be\ndisturbed or troubled about the observance of the law. So far it is\ncompletely in our favour. The exception which immediately follows is not\na new law made by the apostles, but the Divine and eternal command for\nthe preservation of charity inviolate; nor does it diminish a tittle of\nthat liberty: it only admonishes the Gentiles how they ought to\naccommodate themselves to their brethren, to avoid offending them by an\nabuse of their liberty. The second point, therefore, is, that the\nGentiles were to use a harmless liberty, and without offence to their\nbrethren. If it be still objected, that they prescribe a certain\ndirection, I reply, that as far as was expedient for that period, they\npoint out and specify the things in which the Gentiles were liable to\ngive offence to their brethren, that they might refrain from them; yet\nthey add nothing new of their own to the eternal law of God, by which\noffences against our brethren are prohibited.\nXXII. As if any faithful pastors, who preside over churches not yet well\nregulated, were to recommend all their people not to eat meat openly on\nFridays, or to labour publicly on festivals, or the like, till their\nweaker neighbours should be more established. For though, setting aside\nsuperstition, these things are in themselves indifferent, yet when they\nare attended with offences to brethren, they cannot be performed without\nsin; and the times are such that believers could not do these things in\nthe presence of their weak brethren, without most grievously wounding\ntheir consciences. Who but a caviller would say that in this instance\nthey made a new law, whereas it would evidently appear that their sole\nobject was to guard against offences which are most expressly forbidden\nby the Lord? No more can it be said of the apostles, who had no other\ndesign in removing the occasion of offences, than to urge the Divine law\nrespecting the avoidance of offence: as though they had said, It is the\ncommand of the Lord that you hurt not your weak brother; you cannot eat\nmeats offered to idols, or blood, or things strangled, without your weak\nbrethren being offended; therefore, we command you by the word of the\nLord not to eat with offence. And that such was the intention of the\napostles, Paul himself is an unexceptionable witness, who, certainly in\nconsistence with their sentence, writes in the following manner: “As\nconcerning the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto\nidols, we know that an idol is nothing. Howbeit, there is not in every\nman that knowledge; for some with conscience of the idol, eat it as a\nthing offered unto an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is\ndefiled. Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a\nstumbling-block to them that are weak.”[1011] He who shall have duly\nconsidered these things, will not afterwards be deceived by the fallacy\nof those who attempt to justify their tyranny by the example of the\napostles, as if they had begun to infringe the liberty of the Church by\ntheir decree. But that they may not be able to avoid confirming this\nsolution by their own confession, let them tell me by what right they\nhave dared to abrogate that decree. They can only reply, Because there\nwas no more danger from those offences and dissensions which the\napostles intended to guard against, and they knew that a law was to be\njudged of by the end for which it was made. As this law, therefore, is\nadmitted to have been made from a consideration of charity, there is\nnothing prescribed in it any further than charity is concerned. When\nthey confess that the transgression of this law is no other than a\nviolation of charity, do they not thereby acknowledge that it is not a\nnovel addition to the law of God, but a genuine and simple application\nof it to the times and manners for which it was designed?\nXXIII. But it is contended, that though the ecclesiastical laws should\nin a hundred instances be unjust and injurious to us, yet they ought all\nto be obeyed without any exception; for that the point here is not that\nwe should consent to errors, but that we, who are subjects, should\nfulfil even the severe commands of our governors, which we are not at\nliberty to reject. But here likewise the Lord most happily interposes\nwith the truth of his word, delivers us from such bondage, and\nestablishes us in the liberty which he has procured for us by his sacred\nblood, the benefit of which he has repeatedly confirmed by his word. For\nthe question here is not, as they fallaciously pretend, merely whether\nwe shall endure some grievous oppression in our bodies; but whether our\nconsciences shall be deprived of their liberty, that is, of the benefit\nof the blood of Christ, and shall be tormented with a wretched bondage.\nLet us, however, pass over this also, as if it were matter of little\nimportance. But do we think it a matter of little importance to deprive\nthe Lord of his kingdom, which he claims to himself, in such a\nperemptory manner? And it is taken away from him whenever he is\nworshipped with laws of human invention, whereas he requires himself to\nbe honored as the sole legislator of his own worship. And that no one\nmay suppose it to be a thing of trivial importance, let us hear in what\nestimation it is held by the Lord. “Forasmuch,” he says, “as this people\ndraw near me with their mouth, but their fear toward me is taught by the\nprecept of men; therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous\nwork among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; for the\nwisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their\nprudent men shall be hid.”[1012] Again: “In vain do they worship me,\nteaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”[1013] When the children\nof Israel polluted themselves by various idolatries, the cause of all\nthe evil is attributed to the impure mixture which they made by devising\nnew modes of worship in violation of the commands of God. Therefore, the\nsacred history relates that the strangers who had been transplanted by\nthe king of Assyria from Babylon to inhabit Samaria, were torn in pieces\nand devoured by wild beasts, “because they knew not the statutes or\nordinances of the God of the land.” Though they had committed no fault\nin the ceremonies, yet vain pomp would not have been approved by God;\nbut he did not fail to punish the violation of his worship, when men\nintroduced new inventions inconsistent with his word. Hence it is\nafterwards stated, that being terrified with that punishment, they\nadopted rites prescribed in the law; yet because they did not yet\nworship the true God aright, it is twice repeated that “they feared the\nLord,” and, at the same time, that “they feared not the Lord.”[1014]\nWhence we conclude, that part of the reverence which is paid to him\nconsists in our worshipping him in a simple adherence to his commands,\nwithout the admixture of any inventions of our own. Hence the frequent\ncommendations of pious kings, that they “walked in all his commandments,\nand turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.”[1015] I go still\nfurther: though in some services of human invention there appears no\nmanifest impiety, yet as soon as ever men have departed from the command\nof God, it is severely condemned by the Holy Spirit. The altar of Ahaz,\nthe model of which was brought from Damascus, might seem to be an\naddition to the ornaments of the temple, because his design was to offer\nsacrifices upon it to God alone, with a view to perform these services\nin a more splendid manner than upon the ancient and original altar; yet\nwe see how the Holy Spirit detests such audacity, for no other reason\nthan because all the inventions of men in the worship of God are impure\ncorruptions.[1016] And the more clearly the will of God is revealed to\nus, the more inexcusable is our presumption in making any such attempt.\nWherefore the guilt of Manasseh is justly aggravated by the circumstance\nof his having “built” new “altars in the house of the Lord, of which the\nLord said, In Jerusalem will I put my name;”[1017] because such conduct\nwas like an avowed rejection of the authority of God.\nXXIV. Many persons wonder why the Lord so severely threatens that he\nwould “do a marvellous work among the people,” whose “fear toward him”\nwas “taught by the precepts of men,” and pronounces that he is\n“worshipped in vain” by “the commandments of men.” But if such persons\nwould consider what it is to follow the word of God alone in matters of\nreligion, that is, of heavenly wisdom, they would immediately perceive\nit to be for no trivial reason that the Lord abominates such corrupt\nservices, which are rendered to him according to the caprice of the\nhuman mind. For, though persons who obey such laws for the worship of\nGod, have a certain appearance of humility in this their obedience, yet\nthey are very far from being humble before God, to whom they prescribe\nthe same laws which they observe themselves. This is the reason why Paul\nrequires us to be so particularly cautious against being deceived by the\ntraditions of men, and will-worship, that is, voluntary worship,\ninvented by men, without the word of God.[1018] And so indeed it is,\nthat our own wisdom, and that of all other men, must become folly in our\nesteem, that we may allow God alone to be truly wise. This is very far\nfrom being the case with those who study to render themselves acceptable\nto him by petty observances of human contrivance, and obtrude upon him,\nin opposition to his commands, a hypocritical obedience, which in\nreality is rendered to men. This was the conduct of men in former ages;\nthe same has happened within our own remembrance, and still happens in\nthose places where the authority of the creature is more regarded than\nthat of the Creator; where religion, if religion it deserves to be\ncalled, is polluted with more numerous and senseless superstitions than\never disgraced the worship of paganism. For what could proceed from the\nminds of men but things carnal, foolish, and truly expressive of their\nauthors?\nXXV. When the advocates of superstition allege, that Samuel sacrificed\nin Ramah, that there this was done without the direction of the law, yet\nit was acceptable to God,[1019] the answer is easy—that this was not the\nerection of a second altar, in opposition to one already erected, and\nappointed by the Divine command to supersede every other; but as there\nhad yet been no fixed place assigned for the ark of the covenant, he\nappointed the town which he inhabited for the oblation of sacrifices, as\nthe most convenient place. It certainly was not the intention of the\nholy prophet to make any innovation in religious worship, in which God\nhad so strictly forbidden any thing to be added or diminished. The\nexample of Manoah I consider as an extraordinary and singular case.\nThough a private man, he offered a sacrifice to God, yet not without the\nDivine approbation; because he did it not from the hasty impulse of his\nown mind, but in consequence of the secret inspiration of Heaven.[1020]\nBut of the Lord’s utter abomination of all the contrivances of mortals\nin his worship, we have a memorable example in another person, not\ninferior to Manoah—I mean Gideon, whose ephod produced fatal\nconsequences, not only to himself and his family, but to all the\npeople.[1021] In short, every additional invention by which men pretend\nto serve God is nothing but a pollution of true holiness.\nXXVI. Why, then, it is inquired, was it the will of Christ that men\nshould submit to those intolerable burdens which were imposed upon them\nby the scribes and Pharisees?[1022] I ask, on the other hand, Why did\nChrist, in another place, direct men to “beware of the leaven of the\nPharisees and of the Sadducees?”[1023] by _leaven_, according to the\ninterpretation given us by the evangelist, intending every doctrine of\ntheir own that they mixed with the pure word of God. What can we wish\nfor plainer, than when he commands us to avoid and beware of all their\ndoctrine? Hence it is very evident to us, that in the other passage our\nLord did not intend that the consciences of his disciples should be\nharassed with the traditions of the Pharisees; and the words themselves,\nif they are not perverted, convey no such meaning. For, being about to\ndeliver a severe invective against the conduct of the Pharisees, our\nLord only prefaced it by instructing his hearers, that though they would\nsee nothing in their lives worthy of imitation, yet they should continue\nto practise those things which were taught by them in their discourses,\nwhen they were sitting in the chair of Moses, that is to say, when they\nwere expounding the law. His only design, therefore, was to guard the\npeople against being induced to despise the doctrine by the bad examples\nof those who taught it. But, as some persons are never affected by\narguments, but always require authority, I will subjoin the words of\nAugustine, who gives exactly the same interpretation: “The Lord’s fold\nhas pastors, some faithful, some hirelings. Those who are faithful are\ntrue shepherds; yet hear how the hirelings also are necessary. For many\nin the Church, pursuing worldly advantages, preach Christ, and the voice\nof Christ is heard through them; and the sheep follow not the hireling,\nbut the Shepherd by means of the hireling. Hear how the hirelings are\npointed out by the Lord himself. He says, The scribes and Pharisees sit\nin Moses’ chair; what they say, do; but what they do, imitate not. Is\nnot this equivalent to saying, Hear the voice of the Shepherd through\nthe hirelings; for, sitting in the chair of Moses, they teach the law of\nGod; therefore, God teaches by them; but if they choose to teach any\nthing of their own, neither attend to it, nor practise it?”\nXXVII. But, as many ignorant persons, when they hear that the\nconsciences of men ought not to be bound by human traditions, and that\nit is in vain to worship God by such services, immediately conclude the\nsame rule to be applicable to all the laws which regulate the order of\nthe Church, we must also refute their error. It is easy, indeed, to be\ndeceived in this point, because it does not immediately appear, at the\nfirst glance, what a difference there is between the one and the other;\nbut I will place the whole subject in such a clear light, in a few\nwords, that no one may be misled by the resemblance. In the first place,\nlet us consider that if, in every society of men, we see the necessity\nof some polity in order to preserve the common peace, and to maintain\nconcord; if in the transaction of business there is always some order,\nwhich the interest of public virtue, and even of humanity itself,\nforbids to be rejected; the same ought particularly to be observed in\nChurches, which are best supported by a well-ordered regulation of all\ntheir affairs and which without concord are no Churches at all.\nWherefore, if we would make a proper provision for the safety of the\nChurch, we ought to pay the strictest attention to the injunction of\nPaul, that “all things be done decently and in order.”[1024] But as\nthere is such great diversity in the manners of men, so great a variety\nin their minds, and so much contrariety in their judgments and\ninclinations, no polity will be sufficiently steady unless it be\nestablished by certain laws; nor can any order be preserved without some\nsettled form. The laws, therefore, which promote this end, we are so far\nfrom condemning, that, we contend, their abolition would be followed by\na disruption of the bands of union, and the total disorganization and\ndispersion of the Churches. For it is impossible to attain what Paul\nrequires, that “all things be done decently and in order,” unless order\nand decorum be supported by additional regulations. But in regard to\nsuch regulations, care must always be taken, that they be not considered\nnecessary to salvation, and so imposing a religious obligation on the\nconscience, or applied to the worship of God, and so represented as\nessential to piety.\nXXVIII. We have an excellent and most certain mark, therefore, which\ndistinguishes those impious constitutions, by which it has been stated\nthat true religion is obscured and men’s consciences subverted, and the\nlegitimate regulations of the Church, which are always directed to one\nof these two ends, or to both together; that, in the holy assembly of\nbelievers, all things may be conducted with suitable decorum and\ndignity, that the community may be kept in order by the firm bonds of\ncourtesy and moderation. For when it is once understood that a law is\nmade for the sake of public order, this removes the superstition\nembraced by them who place the worship of God in human inventions.\nMoreover, when it is known that it only refers to matters of common\npractice, this overturns all that false notion of obligation and\nnecessity, which filled men’s consciences with great terror, when\ntraditions were thought necessary to salvation. For here nothing is\nrequired but the maintenance of charity among us by the common\nintercourse of friendly offices. But it is proper to describe more fully\nwhat is comprehended under the decorum and the order which Paul\nrecommends. The end of _decorum_ is, partly, that while ceremonies are\nemployed to conciliate veneration to sacred things, we may be excited to\npiety by such aids; partly that the modesty and gravity, which ought to\nbe discovered in all virtuous actions, may be most of all conspicuous in\nthe Church. In _order_, the first point is, that those who preside\nshould be acquainted with the rule and law of good government, and that\nthe people who are governed should be accustomed to an obedience to God\nand to just discipline; the second is, that when the Church is in a well\nregulated state, care should be taken to preserve its peace and\ntranquillity.\nXXIX. We shall not call that _decorum_, therefore, which is merely a\nfrivolous spectacle, yielding an unprofitable gratification; such as we\nsee exemplified in the theatrical apparatus employed by the Papists in\ntheir services, where nothing is to be seen but a useless appearance of\nelegance and splendour, without any advantage. But we shall esteem that\nas _decorum_, which shall be so adapted to inspire a reverence of holy\nmysteries as to be calculated for an exercise of piety; or which at\nleast shall contribute an ornament corresponding to the act; and that\nnot without some beneficial tendency, but that believers may be\nadmonished with what modesty, fear, and reverence, they ought to engage\nin sacred services. Now, that ceremonies may be exercises of piety, it\nis necessary that they should lead us directly to Christ. In like\nmanner, we do not place _order_ in those nugatory pomps which have\nnothing but a vain appearance of splendour, but in that well regulated\npolity, which excludes all confusion, incivility, obstinacy, clamours,\nand dissensions. Of the first kind, examples are furnished by Paul; as\nthat profane banquets should not be connected with the sacred supper of\nthe Lord; that women should not appear in public without being\nveiled;[1025] and many others in common use among us; such as, that we\npray with bended knees and with our heads uncovered; that we administer\nthe sacraments of the Lord, not in a slovenly manner, but with due\ndecorum; that we observe some decent order in the burial of the dead;\nand other things of a similar nature. Of the second sort are the hours\nappointed for public prayers, sermons, and sacraments; quietness and\nsilence under sermons; the singing of hymns; the places appointed for\nthese services, and the days fixed for the celebration of the Lord’s\nsupper;[1026] the prohibition of Paul, that women should not teach in\nthe Church, and the like; but especially the regulations for the\npreservation of discipline, as catechizing, ecclesiastical censures,\nexcommunication, fastings, and every thing else that can be referred to\nthe same class. Thus all the constitutions of the Church which we\nreceive as holy and useful, may be classed under two heads; some refer\nto rites and ceremonies, others to discipline and peace.\nXXX. But, because there is danger here, on the one hand, that the false\nbishops may seize a pretext to excuse their impious and tyrannical laws,\nand, on the other, that there may be some persons who, from an excessive\nfear of falling into the evils we have mentioned, will reject all\necclesiastical laws, however holy and useful they may be,—it is\nnecessary to protest, that I approve of no human constitutions, except\nsuch as are founded on the authority of God, and deduced from the\nScripture, so that they may be considered as altogether Divine. Let us\ntake, as an example, the kneeling practised during solemn prayers. The\nquestion is, whether it be a human tradition, which every one is at\nliberty to reject or neglect. I answer that it is at once both human and\nDivine. It is of God, as it forms a branch of that decorum which is\nrecommended to our attention and observance by the apostle; it is of\nmen, as it particularly designates that which had in general been rather\nhinted than clearly expressed. From this single example, it is easy to\njudge what opinion ought to be entertained of all the rest. Because the\nLord, in his holy oracles, has faithfully comprehended and plainly\ndeclared to us the whole nature of true righteousness, and all the parts\nof Divine worship, with whatever is necessary to salvation,—in these\nthings he is to be regarded as our only Master. Because, in external\ndiscipline and ceremonies, he has not been pleased to give us minute\ndirections what we ought to do in every particular case, foreseeing that\nthis would depend on the different circumstances of different periods,\nand knowing that one form would not be adapted to all ages,—here we must\nhave recourse to the general rules which he has given, that to them may\nbe conformed all the regulations which shall be necessary to the decorum\nand order of the Church. Lastly, as he has delivered no express\ninjunctions on this subject, because these things are not necessary to\nsalvation, and ought to be applied to the edification of the Church,\nwith a variety suitable to the manners of each age and nation,\ntherefore, as the benefit of the Church shall require, it will be right\nto change and abolish former regulations, and to institute new ones. I\ngrant, indeed, that we ought not to resort to innovation rashly or\nfrequently, or for trivial causes. But charity will best decide what\nwill injure or edify, and if we submit to the dictates of charity, all\nwill be well.\nXXXI. Now, such regulations as have been made upon this principle and\nfor this end, it is the duty of Christian people to observe, with a free\nconscience, indeed, and without any superstition, yet with a pious and\nready inclination; they must not treat them with contempt or\ncarelessness, much less violate them, in an open manner, through pride\nand obstinacy. It will be asked, What kind of liberty of conscience can\nbe retained amidst so much attention and caution? I reply, It will very\nwell be supported, when we consider, that these are not fixed and\nperpetual laws by which we are bound, but external aids for human\ninfirmity, which though we do not need, yet we all use, because we are\nunder obligations to each other to cherish mutual charity between us.\nThis may be observed in the examples already mentioned. What! does\nreligion consist in a woman’s veil, so that it would be criminal for her\nto walk out with her face uncovered? Is the solemn decree respecting her\nsilence such as cannot be violated without a capital offence? Is there\nany mystery in kneeling, or in the interment of a dead body, which\ncannot be omitted without sin? Certainly not; for if a woman, in the\nassistance of a neighbour, finds a necessity for such haste as allows\nher no time to cover her head, she commits no offence in running to the\nplace with her head uncovered. And it is sometimes as proper for her to\nspeak, as at other times to be silent. And he who from disease is unable\nto kneel, is quite at liberty to pray standing. Lastly, it is better to\nbury a dead body in proper season, even without a shroud, than, for want\nof persons to carry it to burial, to suffer it to putrefy without\ninterment. Nevertheless, in these things, the customs and laws of the\ncountry we inhabit, the dictates of modesty, and even humanity itself,\nwill direct us what to do, and what to avoid; and if an error be\nincurred through inadvertence or forgetfulness, no crime is committed;\nbut if through contempt, such perverseness deserves to be reprobated. So\nit is of little importance what days and hours are appointed, what is\nthe form of the places, what psalms are sung on the respective days. But\nit is proper that there should be certain days and stated hours, and a\nplace capable of receiving all the people, if any regard be paid to the\npreservation of peace. For what a source of contentions would be\nproduced by the confusion of these things, if every man were permitted\nto change, at his pleasure, what relates to the general order, for it\nwould never happen that the same thing would be agreeable to all, if\nthings were undetermined and left to the choice of every individual. If\nany one object, and resolve to be wiser on this subject than is\nnecessary, let him examine by what reason he can justify his obstinacy\nto the Lord. We ought, however, to be satisfied with the declaration of\nPaul, “If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor\nthe Churches of God.”[1027]\nXXXII. Now, it is necessary to exert the greatest diligence to prevent\nthe intrusion of any error which may corrupt or obscure this pure use of\necclesiastical regulations. This end will be secured, if all the forms,\nwhatever they may be, carry the appearance of manifest utility, if very\nfew are admitted, and principally if they are accompanied with the\ninstructions of a faithful pastor, to shut the door against all corrupt\nopinions. The consequence of this knowledge is, that every person will\nretain his liberty in all these things, and yet will voluntarily impose\nsome restraint upon his liberty, so far as the decorum we have\nmentioned, or the dictates of charity, shall require. In the next place,\nit will be necessary, that, without any superstition, we should attend\nto the observance of these things ourselves, and not too rigidly exact\nit from others; that we should not esteem the worship of God to be\nimproved by the multitude of ceremonies; and that one Church should not\ndespise another on account of a variety of external discipline. Lastly,\nestablishing no perpetual law of this kind for ourselves, we ought to\nrefer the use and end of all such observances to the edification of the\nChurch, according to the exigence of which we should be content not only\nwith the change of some particular observance, but with the abolition of\nany that have hitherto been in use among us. For that the abrogation of\nsome ceremonies, not otherwise inconsistent with piety or decorum, may\nbecome expedient from the circumstances of particular periods, the\npresent age exhibits an actual proof. For such has been the blindness\nand ignorance of former times, Churches have heretofore adhered to\nceremonies with such corrupt sentiments and such obstinate zeal, that it\nis scarcely possible for them to be sufficiently purified from monstrous\nsuperstitions without the abolition of many ceremonies, for the original\ninstitution of which, perhaps, there was some cause, and which are not\nin themselves remarkable for any impiety.\nFootnote 973:\nMatt. xxiii. 4.

          "content": "THE JURISDICTION OF THE CHURCH, AND ITS ABUSE UNDER THE PAPACY.\nWe come now to the third branch of the power of the Church, and that\nwhich is the principal one in a well regulated state, which we have said\nconsists in jurisdiction. The whole jurisdiction of the Church relates\nto the discipline of manners, of which we are about to treat. For as no\ncity or town can exist without a magistracy and civil polity, so the\nChurch of God, as I have already stated, but am now obliged to repeat,\nstands in need of a certain spiritual polity; which, however, is\nentirely distinct from civil polity, and is so far from obstructing or\nweakening it, that, on the contrary, it highly conduces to its\nassistance and advancement. This power of jurisdiction, therefore, will,\nin short, be no other than an order instituted for the preservation of\nthe spiritual polity. For this end, there were from the beginning\njudiciaries appointed in the Churches, to take cognizance of manners, to\npass censures on vices, and to preside over the use of the keys in\nexcommunication. This order Paul designates in his First Epistle to the\nCorinthians, when he mentions “governments;”[1028] and to the Romans,\nwhen he says, “He that ruleth,” let him do it “with diligence.”[1029] He\nis not speaking of magistrates or civil governors, for there were at\nthis time no Christian magistrates, but of those who were associated\nwith the pastor in the spiritual government of the Church. In the First\nEpistle to Timothy, also, he mentions two kinds of presbyters or elders,\nsome “who labour in the word and doctrine,” others who have nothing to\ndo with preaching the word, and yet “rule well.”[1030] By the latter\nclass, there can be no doubt that he intends those who were appointed to\nthe cognizance of manners, and to the whole exercise of the keys. For\nthis power, of which we now speak, entirely depends on the keys, which\nChrist has conferred upon the Church in the eighteenth chapter of\nMatthew, where he commands that those who shall have despised private\nadmonitions shall be severely admonished in the name of the whole\nChurch; and that if they persist in their obstinacy, they are to be\nexcluded from the society of believers.[1031] Now, these admonitions and\ncorrections cannot take place without an examination of the cause; hence\nthe necessity of some judicature and order. Wherefore, unless we would\nnullify the promise of the keys, and entirely abolish excommunication,\nsolemn admonitions, and every thing of a similar kind, it is necessary\nto allow the Church some jurisdiction. Let it be observed, that the\npassage to which we have referred, relates not to the general authority\nof the doctrine to be preached by the apostles, as in the sixteenth\nchapter of Mathew and the twentieth chapter of John; but that the power\nof the sanhedrim is for the future transferred to the Church of Christ.\nTill that time, the Jews had their own method of government, which, as\nfar as regards the pure institution, Jesus Christ established in his\nChurch, and that with a severe sanction. For this was absolutely\nnecessary, because the judgment of an ignoble and despised Church might\notherwise be treated with contempt by presumptuous and proud men. And\nthat the readers may not be embarrassed by the circumstance of Christ\nhaving used the same words to express different things, it will be\nuseful to solve this difficulty. There are two places which speak of\n_binding_ and _loosing_. One is in the sixteenth chapter of Matthew,\nwhere Christ, after having promised Peter that he would “give” him “the\nkeys of the kingdom of heaven,”[1032] immediately adds, “Whatsoever thou\nshalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt\nloose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.” In these words he means\nprecisely the same as he intends in other language recorded by John,\nwhen, being about to send forth his disciples to preach, after having\n“breathed on them,” he said, “Whose soever sins ye remit, they are\nremitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are\nretained.”[1033] I shall offer an interpretation of this passage,\nwithout any subtlety, violence, or perversion, but natural, suitable,\nand obvious. This command respecting the remission and retention of\nsins, and the promise made to Peter respecting binding and loosing,\nought to be wholly referred to the ministry of the word, which when our\nLord committed to the apostles, he at the same time invested them with\nthe power of binding and loosing. For what is the sum of the gospel, but\nthat, being all slaves of sin and death, we are loosed and delivered by\nthe redemption which is in Christ Jesus, and that those who never\nreceive or acknowledge Christ as their Deliverer and Redeemer, are\ncondemned and sentenced to eternal chains? When the Lord delivered this\nembassy to his apostles, to be conveyed to all nations, in order to\nevince it to be his, and to have proceeded from him, he honoured it with\nthis remarkable testimony, and that for the particular confirmation both\nof the apostles themselves, and of all those to whom it was to be\nannounced. It was of importance, that the apostles should have a strong\nand constant assurance of their preaching; which they were not only to\nundertake and execute amidst immense labours, cares, troubles, and\ndangers, but were at length to seal with their blood. That they might\nknow this ministry not to be vain or ineffectual, but full of power and\nenergy, it was of importance for them, in circumstances of such great\nanxiety, difficulty, and danger, to be persuaded that they were employed\nin the work of God; amidst all the hostility and opposition of the whole\nworld, to know that God was on their side; and though Christ, the Author\nof their doctrine, was not present to their view on earth, to be certain\nthat he was in heaven to confirm the truth of the doctrine which he had\ndelivered to them. On the other hand, also, it was necessary that the\nmost unequivocal testimony should be given to their hearers, that the\ndoctrine of the gospel was not the word of the apostles, but of God\nhimself; not a voice issuing from the earth, but descended from heaven.\nFor these things, the remission of sins, the promise of eternal life,\nand the message of salvation, cannot be in the power of man. Therefore\nChrist has testified that, in the preaching of the gospel, nothing\nbelonged to the apostles, except the ministration of it; that it was he\nhimself who spoke and promised every thing by the instrumentality of\ntheir mouths; and, consequently, that the remission of sins which they\npreached was the true promise of God, and that the condemnation which\nthey denounced was the certain judgment of God. Now, this testification\nhas been given to all ages, and remains unaltered, to certify and assure\nus all, that the word of the gospel, by whomsoever it may happen to be\npreached, is the very sentence of God himself, promulgated from his\nheavenly tribunal, recorded in the book of life, ratified, confirmed,\nand fixed in heaven. Thus we see, that the power of the keys, in these\npassages, is no other than the preaching of the gospel, and that,\nconsidered with regard to men, it is not so much authoritative as\nministerial; for, strictly speaking, Christ has not given this power to\nmen, but to his word, of which he has appointed men to be the ministers.\nII. The other passage, which we have mentioned, relative to the power of\nbinding and loosing, is in the eighteenth chapter of Matthew, where\nChrist says, “If any brother neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto\nthee as a heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever\nye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye\nshall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.”[1034] This passage is\nnot altogether similar to the first, but is to be understood in a manner\nsomewhat different; though I do not conceive the difference to be so\ngreat, but that there is a considerable affinity between them. In the\nfirst place, they are both alike in this respect, that each contains a\ngeneral declaration, the same power of always binding and loosing,—that\nis, by the word of God,—the same command, the same promise. But they\ndiffer in this, that the former passage peculiarly relates to the\npreaching of the gospel, which is performed by the ministers of the\nword; the latter relates to the discipline, which is committed to the\nChurch. The Church binds him whom it excommunicates; not that it\nconsigns him to perpetual ruin and despair, but because it condemns his\nlife and manners, and already warns him of his final condemnation,\nunless he repent. The Church looses him whom it receives into its\ncommunion; because it makes him, as it were, a partaker of the unity\nwhich it has in Christ Jesus. That no man, therefore, may contemn the\njudgment of the Church, or consider it as of little consequence that he\nis condemned by the voice of believers, the Lord testifies that such\njudgment of believers is no other than the promulgation of his sentence,\nand that what they do on earth shall be ratified in heaven. For they\nhave the word of God, by which they condemn the perverse; they have the\nsame word, by which they receive penitents into favour; and they cannot\nerr or dissent from the judgment of God, because they judge only by the\nDivine law, which is not an uncertain or earthly opinion, but the holy\nwill and heavenly oracle of God. From these two passages, which I think\nI have familiarly and correctly, as well as concisely, explained, these\nunreasonable men, without any judgment, under the influence of misguided\nzeal, endeavour to establish, sometimes auricular confession, sometimes\nexcommunication, sometimes jurisdiction, sometimes the right of\nlegislation, and sometimes indulgences. The former passage they allege\nto support the primacy of the Roman see. They are so expert in fitting\ntheir keys to any locks and doors they please, that it should seem as if\nthey had followed the business of locksmiths all their lifetime.\nIII. The opinion entertained by some persons, that these things were\nonly temporary, while all civil magistrates were strangers to the\nprofession of Christianity, is a mistake for want of considering the\ngreat distinction, and the nature of the difference, between the\necclesiastical and civil power. For the Church has no power of the sword\nto punish or to coerce, no authority to compel, no prisons, fines, or\nother punishments, like those inflicted by the civil magistrate.\nBesides, the object of this power is, not that he who has transgressed\nmay be punished against his will but that he may profess his repentance\nby a voluntary submission to chastisement. The difference therefore is\nvery great; because the Church does not assume to itself what belongs to\nthe magistrate, nor can the magistrate execute that which is executed by\nthe Church. This will be better understood by an example. Is any man\nintoxicated? In a well regulated city he will be punished by\nimprisonment. Has he committed fornication? He will receive the same or\na severer punishment. With this, the laws, the magistrate, and the civil\njudgment, will all be satisfied; though it may happen that he will give\nno sign of repentance, but will rather murmur and repine against his\npunishment. Will the Church stop here? Such persons cannot be admitted\nto the sacred supper without doing an injury to Christ and to his holy\ninstitution. And reason requires, that he who has offended the Church\nwith an evil example, should remove, by a solemn declaration of\nrepentance, the offence which he has excited. The argument adduced by\nthose who espouse a contrary opinion, is of no force. They say, that\nChrist assigned this office to the Church, when there was no magistrate\nto execute it. But it frequently happens that the magistrate is too\nnegligent, and sometimes that he even deserves to be chastised himself;\nwhich was the case with the emperor Theodosius. Besides, the same\nargument might be extended to the whole ministry of the word. Now, then,\naccording to them, pastors must no longer censure notorious crimes; they\nmust cease to chide, to reprove, to rebuke; for there are Christian\nmagistrates, whose duty it is to correct such offences by the civil\nsword. But as it is the duty of the magistrate, by punishment and\ncorporeal coercion, to purge the Church from offences, so it behoves the\nminister of the word, on his part, to relieve the magistrate by\npreventing the multiplication of offenders. Their respective operations\nought to be so connected as to be an assistance, and not an obstruction\nto each other.\nIV. And, indeed, whoever will closely examine the words of Christ, will\neasily perceive that they describe the stated and perpetual order, and\nnot any temporary regulation, of the Church. For it is unreasonable for\nus to bring an accusation before a magistrate, against those who refuse\nto submit to our admonitions; yet this would be necessary if the\nmagistrate succeeded to this office of the Church. What shall we say of\nthis promise, “Verily I say unto thee, whatsoever ye shall bind on\nearth, shall be bound in heaven?” Was it only for one, or for a few\nyears? Besides, Christ here instituted nothing new, but followed the\ncustom always observed in the ancient Church of his own nation; thereby\nsignifying, that the spiritual jurisdiction, which had been exercised\nfrom the beginning, was indispensable to the Church. And this has been\nconfirmed by the consent of all ages. For when emperors and magistrates\nbegan to assume the profession of Christianity, the spiritual\njurisdiction was not in consequence abolished, but only regulated in\nsuch a manner as neither to derogate from the civil power, nor to be\nconfounded with it. And that justly; for a pious magistrate will not\nwish to exempt himself from the common subjection of the children of\nGod, which in no small degree consists in submitting to the Church, when\nit judges by the word of God: so very far is it from being his duty to\nabolish such a judicature. “For what is more honourable,” says Ambrose,\n“than for the emperor to be called the son of the Church? For a good\nemperor is within the Church, not above the Church.” Wherefore those\nwho, to exalt the magistrate, despoil the Church of this power, not only\npervert the language of Christ by a false interpretation, but pass a\nmost severe censure on all the holy bishops who have lived since the\ntime of the apostles, for having usurped to themselves, under a false\npretext, the honour and dignity which belonged to the magistrate.\nV. But, on the other hand, it is also worth while to examine what was\nthe true and ancient use of the jurisdiction of the Church, and what a\ngreat abuse of it has been introduced; that we may know what ought to be\nabrogated, and what ought to be restored from antiquity, if we would\noverturn the reign of Antichrist, and reëstablish the true kingdom of\nChrist. In the first place, the object to be secured is the prevention\nof offences, or the abolition of any that may have arisen. In the use of\nit, two things require to be considered; first, that this spiritual\npower be entirely separated from the power of the sword; secondly, that\nit be administered, not at the pleasure of one man, but by a legitimate\nassembly. Both these things were observed in the purer ages of the\nChurch. For the holy bishops never exercised their authority by fines,\nimprisonments, or other civil punishments; but, as became them, employed\nnothing but the word of the Lord. For the severest vengeance, the\nultimate punishment of the Church, is excommunication, which is never\nresorted to without absolute necessity. Now, excommunication requires no\nexternal force, but is content with the power of the word of God. In\nshort, the jurisdiction of the primitive Church was no other than a\npractical exposition of the description which Paul gives of the\nspiritual authority of pastors. This power he represents as conferred\nfor the purpose of “casting down imaginations, and every high thing that\nexalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into\ncaptivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; and having in\nreadiness to revenge all disobedience.”[1035] As this is accomplished by\nthe preaching of the doctrine of Christ, so to preserve that doctrine\nfrom falling into contempt, they who profess themselves of the household\nof faith ought to be judged by what that doctrine contains. That cannot\nbe done, except the ministry be accompanied with the power to take\ncognizance of those who are to be privately admonished, or more severely\ncensured, and also to exclude from the communion of the Supper those who\ncannot be admitted without a profanation of such a solemn sacrament.\nWherefore when he denies, in another place, that we have any right “to\njudge them that are without,”[1036] he makes the children of the church\nsubject to the censures by which their faults are chastised, and implies\nthe existence at that time of judicatures from which none of the\nbelievers were exempt.\nVI. This power, as we have stated, was not in the hands of one man, for\nhim to act according to his own pleasure, but resided in the assembly of\nthe elders, which was in the Church what a senate is in a city. Cyprian,\nwhen he mentions by whom it was exercised in his time, generally unites\nall the clergy with the bishop; but in other passages he also shows,\nthat the clergy presided in such a manner, that the people were not\nexcluded from this cognizance. For he expresses himself in these words:\n“From the commencement of my episcopate, I have determined to do nothing\nwithout the counsel of the clergy and the consent of the people.” But\nthe common and usual custom was for the jurisdiction of the Church to be\nexercised by the council of the presbyters; of whom, as I have observed,\nthere were two classes; for some were ordained to the office of\nteaching, others were only censors of manners. This institution\ngradually degenerated from its original establishment; so that, in the\ntime of Ambrose, the judicial administration of the Church was wholly in\nthe hands of the clergy; of which he complains in the following\nlanguage: “The ancient synagogue, and afterwards the Church, had elders,\nwithout whose advice nothing was done. I know not by what negligence\nthis practice has been discontinued, except from the indolence of the\ndoctors, or rather from their pride, while they wish none but\nthemselves, to be seen.” We perceive how indignant was that holy man,\nthat there had been some declension from a better state of things,\nthough they still retained an order that was at least tolerable. What\nwould he say now, if he were to see the present deformed ruins, which\nexhibit scarcely a vestige of the ancient edifice! What a complaint\nwould he make! First, in opposition to law and justice, that which had\nbeen given to the Church, the bishop usurped entirely to himself. This\nresembles the conduct of a consul or president, expelling the senate,\nand seizing the sole administration of a government. But as the bishop\nis superior to other persons in honour, so the assembly or congregation\npossesses more authority than one individual. It was a gross outrage,\ntherefore, for one man to transfer to himself all the power of the\ncommunity, and thereby to open a door to licentious tyranny, to deprive\nthe Church of its rights, and to suppress and abolish an assembly\nappointed by the Spirit of Christ.\nVII. But as one evil always produces another, bishops, disdaining this\ncharge as unworthy of their attention, have delegated it to others.\nHence the creation of officials, to discharge that duty. I say nothing,\nat present, of the characters of the persons; I only assert, that they\ndiffer in no respect from civil judges; yet they still call it a\nspiritual jurisdiction, where all the contention is about secular\naffairs. Though there were no other evil, what effrontery must they\nhave, to call a court full of litigation the judicature of the Church!\nBut, it is alleged, it employs admonitions, and pronounces\nexcommunication. Is it thus that they trifle with God? Does a poor man\nowe a sum of money? He is cited. If he appear, he is condemned; after\nthe condemnation, if he do not pay, he is admonished: after the second\nadmonition, they proceed to excommunication. If he do not appear to the\ncitation, he is admonished to be forthcoming: if he delay, he is\nadmonished a second time, and soon after is excommunicated. I ask, What\nis there in this that bears any resemblance to the institution of\nChrist, the ancient usage, or the order of the Church? It is further\nalleged, that this court also corrects vices. I reply, that acts of\nfornication, lasciviousness, and drunkenness, and similar enormities,\nthey not only tolerate, but sanction and encourage, by a kind of tacit\napprobation, and that not only in the people, but even in the clergy\nthemselves. Among multitudes of offenders, they only summon a few,\neither to avoid too flagrant an appearance of connivance, or for the\npurpose of extorting money. I say nothing of the robbery, the rapine,\nthe peculation, the sacrilege, connected with this office. I say nothing\nof the characters of most of the persons selected to discharge it. It is\nmore than sufficient for us, that while the Romanists boast of their\nspiritual jurisdiction, it is easy to show that nothing is more contrary\nto the order appointed by Christ, and that it has no more resemblance to\nthe ancient practice, than darkness has to light.\nVIII. Though we have not said all that might be adduced for this\npurpose, and what we have said has been condensed within a small\ncompass, yet I trust we have so refuted our adversaries, as to leave no\nroom for any one to doubt that the spiritual power arrogated by the pope\nand all his hierarchy, is a tyrannical usurpation, chargeable with\nimpious opposition to the word of God, and injustice to his people.\nUnder the term _spiritual power_, I include their audacity in\nfabricating new doctrines, by which they have seduced the unhappy people\nfrom the native purity of the word of God, the iniquitous traditions by\nwhich they have insnared them, and the pretended ecclesiastical\njurisdiction which they exercise by their suffragans, vicars,\npenitentiaries, and officials. For if we allow Christ any kingdom among\nus, all this kind of domination must immediately fall to the ground. The\npower of the sword, which they also claim, as that is not exercised over\nconsciences, but operates on property, is irrelevant to our present\nsubject; though in this also it is worth while to remark, that they are\nalways consistent with themselves, and are at the greatest possible\ndistance from the character they would be thought to sustain, as pastors\nof the Church. Here I am not censuring the particular vices of\nindividuals, but the general wickedness and common pest of the whole\norder, which they would consider as degraded, if it were not\ndistinguished by wealth and lofty titles. If we consult the authority of\nChrist on this subject, there is no doubt that he intended to exclude\nthe ministers of his word from civil dominion and secular sovereignty,\nwhen he said, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them;\nbut it shall not be so among you.”[1037] For by these words he\nsignifies, not only that the office of a pastor is distinct from the\noffice of a prince, but that they are so different, that they can never\nbe properly united in one man. For though Moses held both these offices\nat once, it may be observed, first, that this was the result of a\nspecial miracle; secondly, that it was only a temporary arrangement,\ntill things should be better regulated. But, as soon as God prescribed a\ncertain form of government, Moses was left in possession of the civil\nadministration, and was commanded to resign the priesthood to his\nbrother; and that for a very sufficient reason; for it is beyond the\nability of nature for one man to be capable of sustaining the burden of\nboth. And this has been carefully observed in the Church in all ages.\nFor as long as any real appearance of a Church remained, not one of the\nbishops ever thought of usurping the power of the sword; so that it was\na common proverb in the time of Ambrose, “That emperors rather coveted\nthe priesthood, than priests the empire;” for as he afterwards observes,\nit was the firm and universal opinion, “That palaces belonged to\nemperors, and churches to priests.”\nIX. But since a method has been contrived for bishops to retain the\ntitle, honour, and emoluments of their office without any burden or\nsolicitude, that they might not be left entirely without occupation, the\npower of the sword has been given to them, or rather they have usurped\nit to themselves. With what plea will they defend such impudence? Was it\nfor bishops to perplex themselves with judicial proceedings, to assume\nthe government of cities and provinces, and to undertake various other\noccupations so incompatible with their office, which alone would furnish\nthem so much labour and employment, that even if they were entirely and\nassiduously devoted to it, without the least distraction of other\navocations, they would scarcely be able to discharge its functions? But\nthey have the hardihood to boast, that this causes the Church of Christ\nto flourish with a glory suitable to its dignity, and at the same time\nthat they are not too much distracted from the duties of their vocation.\nWith respect to the first point, if it be a becoming ornament of the\nsacred office, for those who sustain it to be elevated to a degree of\npower formidable to the greatest monarchs, they have reason to\nexpostulate with Christ, by whom their honour has been so grievously\nwounded. For in their opinion, at least, what could have been said more\ndisgraceful than the following language? “The kings of the Gentiles\nexercise dominion over them; but it shall not be so among you.”[1038]\nNor has he prescribed a severer law to his servants than he first\nimposed upon himself. “Man,” says he, “who made me a judge or a divider\nover you?”[1039] We see he plainly refuses to act the part of a judge,\nwhich he would not have done, had it been a thing consistent with his\noffice. Will not his servants allow themselves to be reduced to that\nrank, to which their Lord voluntarily submitted himself? With respect to\nthe second point, I wish they could as easily prove it by experience as\nmake the assertion. But since the apostles thought it not right for them\n“to leave the word of God, and serve tables,”[1040] this must confound\nthose who are reluctant to admit, that it is not in the power of the\nsame man to be at the same time a good bishop and a good prince. For if\nthey, who by the extent of the gifts with which they were endued, were\nenabled to sustain far more numerous and weighty cares than any men who\nhave lived since their time, after all confessed themselves incapable of\nattending to the word of God and the service of tables without fainting\nunder the burden, how should it be possible for these men, who are by no\nmeans to be compared to the apostles, so vastly to surpass them in\nindustry? The very attempt has betrayed the most consummate effrontery\nand presumptuous confidence. Yet we see it has been done; with what\nsuccess, is obvious; the unavoidable consequence has been the desertion\nof their own functions, and intrusion into those which belonged to\nothers.\nX. It has, without doubt, been from small beginnings, that they have\ngradually risen to such eminence. For it was not possible for them to\nmake so great an advance at one step. But sometimes by fraudulent and\nsecret artifices, they exalted themselves in a clandestine manner, so\nthat no one perceived the encroachment till it had been effected:\nsometimes, when opportunity offered, by terrifying and menacing princes,\nthey extorted from them some augmentation of their power; sometimes,\nwhen they saw princes inclined to favour them, they abused their foolish\nand inconsiderate pliability. In early times, if any controversy arose,\nthe believers, in order to avoid the necessity of litigation, used to\nrefer it to the decision of their bishop, of whose integrity they were\nfully satisfied. The ancient bishops were frequently embarrassed with\nsuch arbitrations, which exceedingly displeased them, as Augustine\nsomewhere declares; but to save the parties from lawsuits, they\nreluctantly undertook this troublesome business. From voluntary\narbitrations, which were entirely different from the processes of civil\ncourts, their successors have erected an ordinary jurisdiction. In a\nsubsequent period, when cities and countries were oppressed with various\ndistresses, they had recourse to the patronage of their bishops, that\nthey might be protected by their influence; succeeding bishops, by\nwonderful artifice, of protectors have made themselves lords. Nor can it\nbe denied, that the principal acquisitions they have made, have been\neffected by faction and violence. The princes, who voluntarily invested\nthe bishops with jurisdiction, were actuated to this by various motives.\nBut though their indulgence may have exhibited some appearance of piety,\nyet their preposterous liberality was by no means adapted to promote the\nbenefit of the Church, the ancient and genuine discipline of which they\nthereby corrupted, or rather, to say the truth, utterly annihilated. But\nthose bishops who have abused such kindness of princes to their own\nprofit, have sufficiently evinced, by this one specimen, that they were\nin reality no bishops at all. For if they had possessed a particle of\nthe apostolic spirit, they would unquestionably have answered, in the\nlanguage of Paul, that “the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,\nbut”[1041] spiritual. Instead of this, hurried away with a blind\ncupidity, they have ruined themselves, and their successors, and the\nChurch.\nXI. At length the Roman pontiff, not content with small provinces, first\nlaid his hand upon kingdoms, and then seized upon the empire. And to\nassign some plausible pretext for retaining a possession acquired by\nmere robbery, he sometimes boasts that he holds it by Divine right,\nsometimes pretends the donation from Constantine, and sometimes pleads\nsome other title. In the first place, I answer with Bernard, that\nsupposing he could vindicate his claim by any other reason, yet he\ncannot establish it by any apostolic right. “For Peter could not give\nwhat he never possessed; but he left his successors, what he did\npossess, the care of the churches. But as the Lord and Master said of\nhimself, that he was not constituted a judge between two persons, the\nservant and disciple ought not to think it any disgrace not to be judge\nof all men.” Bernard is speaking here of civil judgments, for he adds,\naddressing the pope, “Therefore your power is over sins, and not over\npossessions, since it is for the former, and not for the latter, that\nyou have received the keys of the kingdom of heaven. For which appears\nto you the superior dignity, to remit sins, or to divide lands? There is\nno comparison. These low and earthly things are subject to the judgment\nof kings and princes of the earth. Why do you invade the province of\nothers?” Again; “You are made a superior. For what purpose? Not to\nexercise dominion, I apprehend. However highly we think of ourselves,\ntherefore, let us remember that we are appointed to a ministry not\ninvested with a sovereignty. Learn that you want no sceptre, but a\npruning-knife, to cultivate the Lord’s vineyard.” Again: “It is plain\nthat sovereignty is forbidden to the apostles. Go then, if you dare, and\nsustaining the office of a temporal sovereign, usurp the name of an\napostle, or filling an apostolical office, usurp a temporal\nsovereignty.” And immediately after: “This is the apostolic form: they\nare forbidden to exercise any dominion; they are commanded to minister\nand serve.” Though all these observations of Bernard are evidently\nconsistent with the truth, and even though the true state of the case\nmust be obvious to all without any thing being said, yet the Roman\npontiff was not ashamed, at the Council of Arles, to decree, that the\nsupreme power of both swords belonged to him by Divine right.\nXII. With respect to the donation of Constantine, persons who have only\na moderate acquaintance with the histories of those times, need no\ninformation how fabulous, and even ridiculous, this is. But to leave the\nhistories, Gregory, who lived above four hundred years after, is alone a\ncompetent and very sufficient witness of this fact. For, wherever he\nspeaks of the emperor, he gives him the title of Most Serene Lord, and\ncalls himself his unworthy servant. In one place he says, “Let not our\nlord, from his earthly power, be too ready to treat priests with\ndisdain; but with excellent consideration, for the sake of him whose\nservants they are, let him rule over them in such a manner, as at the\nsame time to pay them due reverence.” We see how, in the common\nsubjection, he wished to be considered as one of the people; for he is\nthere pleading, not another person’s cause, but his own. In another\nplace he says, “I trust in Almighty God, that he will grant a long life\nto our pious lords, and will govern us under your hand according to his\nmercy.” I have not quoted these passages with any design to discuss at\nlarge this question of the donation of Constantine, but merely to show\nmy readers, by the way, what a puerile falsehood it is of the Romanists,\nto attempt to claim a temporal sovereignty for their pontiff. And so\nmuch the more contemptible is the impudence of Augustine Steuchus, the\npope’s librarian, who has had the effrontery to prostitute his labours\nto serve his master in such a desperate cause. Laurentius Valla had\namply refuted that fable, which was no difficulty to a man of learning\nand an acute reasoner; yet, like a man little conversant in\necclesiastical affairs, he had not said all that would have corroborated\nthe argument. Steuchus sallies forth, and scatters the most disgusting\ntrash to obscure the clear light. But, in fact, he pleads the cause of\nhis master with no more force than if some facetious wit, ironically\nprofessing the same object, were in reality supporting the opposite side\nof the question. But this cause is well worthy of such advocates as the\npope hires to defend it; and equally worthy are those mercenary\nscribblers of being disappointed in their hopes of gain, as was the case\nwith Eugubinus.\nXIII. But if any one inquire the time when this fictitious empire began\nto arise, there have not yet elapsed five hundred years since the\npontiffs were still in subjection to the emperors, and no pontiff was\ncreated without the authority of the emperor. The first occasion of\ninnovation in this order was given to Gregory VII. by the emperor Henry,\nthe fourth of that name, a man of rash and unsteady disposition, of no\njudgment, great audacity, and dissolute life. For when he had all the\nbishoprics of Germany in his court, either exposed to sale, or to be\ndistributed as a booty, Hildebrand, who had been offended with him,\nseized a plausible pretext to avenge himself. Because he appeared to\nadvocate a good and pious cause, he was assisted by the favour of many;\nand Henry, on the other hand, had rendered himself odious to the\ngenerality of princes, by the insolence of his government. At length\nHildebrand, who assumed the name of Gregory VII., being a man of no\npiety or integrity, betrayed the wickedness of his heart; in consequence\nof which many, who had concurred with him, afterwards deserted him. He\nso far succeeded, however, as to enable his successors not only to cast\noff the imperial yoke with impunity, but even to oblige the emperors to\nsubmit to them. After that time there were many emperors, more like\nHenry than like Julius Cæsar, whom there was no difficulty in overcoming\nwhile they were sitting at home in indolence and unconcern, when there\nwas the greatest necessity for every vigorous and legitimate exertion to\nrepress the cupidity of the pontiffs. Thus we see with what plausibility\nthey have represented this admirable donation of Constantine, by which\nthe pope pretends himself to have been invested with the sovereignty of\nthe Western empire.\nXIV. From that period the pontiffs have never ceased encroaching on the\njurisdictions, and seizing on the territories, of others, sometimes\nemploying fraud, sometimes treachery, and sometimes open war; even the\ncity of Rome itself, which till then was free, about a hundred and\nthirty years ago was compelled to submit to their dominion; in short,\nthey proceeded to make continual advances, till they attained the power\nwhich they at present possess, and for the retention or augmentation of\nwhich, they have now, for the space of two hundred years, (for they had\nbegun before they usurped the government of the city,) so disturbed and\ndistracted the Christian world, that they have brought it to the brink\nof ruin. In the time of Gregory the First, when the guardians of the\necclesiastical property seized for themselves the lands which belonged\nto the Church, and, according to the custom of princes, set up their\ntitles and armorial bearings on them in token of their claim, Gregory\nassembled a provincial council of bishops, in which he severely\ninveighed against that profane custom, and asked whether they would not\nexcommunicate any ecclesiastic who should attempt the seizure of\nproperty by the inscription of a title, or even any bishop who should\ndirect such a thing to be done, or if done without his direction, should\nnot punish it. They all pronounced that every such offender should be\nexcommunicated. But if claiming a field by the inscription of a title,\nbe a crime deserving of excommunication in a priest,—when for two whole\ncenturies the pontiffs have been meditating nothing but wars, effusion\nof blood, slaughter of armies, storming and pillaging cities, the\ndestruction of nations, the devastation of kingdoms, for the sole\npurpose of seizing the dominions of others,—what excommunications can be\nsufficient for the punishment of such examples? It is clear beyond all\ndoubt, that the glory of Christ is the object furthest from their\npursuit. For if they voluntarily resign all the secular power which they\npossess, no danger will result to the glory of God, to sound doctrine,\nor to the safety of the Church; but they are infatuated, and stimulated\nby the mere lust of dominion; and consider nothing as safe, unless, as\nthe prophet says, “they rule with force and with cruelty.”[1042]\nXV. With jurisdiction is connected the immunity which the Roman\necclesiastics arrogate to themselves. For they consider it a degradation\nfor them to appear before a civil judge in personal causes, and they\nimagine the liberty and dignity of the Church to consist in their\nexemption from the common judicature and laws. But the ancient bishops,\nwho in other respects were the most rigid assertors of the rights of the\nChurch, esteemed it no injury to themselves, or to their order, to be\nsubject to lay judges in civil causes. The pious emperors also, without\nany opposition, always summoned the clergy before their tribunals,\nwhenever necessity required it. For this is the language of Constantine,\nin his epistle to the bishops of Nicomedia: “If any bishop excite any\ndisturbance by his indiscretion, his presumption shall be restrained by\nthe authority of the minister of God, that is, by mine.” And Valentinian\nsays, “Good bishops never traduce the power of the emperor, but\nsincerely observe the commands of God, the sovereign King, and obey our\nlaws.” At that time this principle was universally admitted, without any\ncontroversy. Ecclesiastical causes were referred to the judgment of the\nbishop. As for example, if any ecclesiastic had committed no crime\nagainst the laws, but was only charged with offending against the\ncanons, he was not summoned to the common tribunal, but was judged by\nthe bishop. In like manner, if a question was agitated respecting an\narticle of faith, or any other subject properly belonging to the Church,\nto the Church the cognizance of it was committed. In this sense is to be\nunderstood what Ambrose writes to the emperor Valentinian: “Your father,\nof august memory, not only answered verbally, but also ordained by\nedicts, that, in a cause relating to faith, he ought to judge, who is\nnot disqualified by office or dignity.” Again: “If we regard the\nScriptures or ancient examples, who will deny that in a cause of\nfaith,—I say, in a cause of faith,—it is customary for bishops to judge\nof Christian emperors, and not emperors of bishops?” Again: “I would\nhave come to your consistory, sire, if either the bishops or the people\nwould have suffered me to go; but they say, that a cause of faith ought\nto be discussed in the Church, in the presence of the people.” He\ncontended that a spiritual cause—that is, a cause affecting\nreligion—ought not to be carried into a civil court, where secular\ncontroversies are agitated; and his constancy in this respect has been\nuniversally and justly applauded. Yet, notwithstanding the goodness of\nhis cause, he went no further than to declare, that if the emperor\nproceeded to employ force, he would submit. He says, “I will not\nvoluntarily desert the station committed to me: in case of compulsion, I\nknow not how to resist, for our arms are prayers and tears.” Let us\nobserve the singular combination of moderation and prudence with\nmagnanimity and confidence in this holy man. Justina, the mother of the\nemperor, because she could not induce him to join the Arians,\nendeavoured to deprive him of his bishopric. And she would have\nsucceeded in her attempts, if, in compliance with the summons, he had\ngone to the palace of the emperor to plead his cause. Therefore he\ndenied the emperor to be a competent judge of so important a\ncontroversy; and this was necessary both from the circumstances of that\ntime, and from the invariable nature of the subject itself. For he was\nof opinion, that it was his duty to suffer death rather than, by his\nconsent, to permit such an example to be transmitted to posterity; and\nyet in case of violence being employed, he cherished not a thought of\nresistance. For he denied it to be compatible with the character of a\nbishop to defend the faith and privileges of the Church by arms; but in\nother cases he showed himself ready to do whatever the emperor would\ncommand. “If he demands tribute,” says he, “we do not refuse it; the\nlands of the Church pay tribute. If he demands the lands, he has power\nto take them; none of us will oppose him.” Gregory also speaks in a\nsimilar manner. “I am not ignorant,” he says, “of the mind of our most\nserene lord, that he is not in the habit of interfering in sacerdotal\ncauses, lest he should in any respect be burdened with our sins.” He\ndoes not entirely exclude the emperor from judging priests, but observes\nthat there are certain causes which he ought to leave to the decision of\nthe Church.\nXVI. And even in this exception, the sole object of these holy men was\nto prevent the tyrannical violence and caprice of princes less\nfavourable to religion from obstructing the Church in the discharge of\nits duty. For they did not disapprove of the occasional interposition of\nprinces in ecclesiastical affairs, provided they would exert their\nauthority for the preservation of the order of the Church, and not for\nthe disturbance of it; for the establishment of discipline, and not for\nits relaxation. For as the Church neither possesses, nor ought to\ndesire, the power to constrain,—I speak of civil coercion,—it is the\npart of pious kings and princes to support religion by laws, edicts, and\njudicial sentences. For this reason, when the emperor Mauritius\ncommanded certain bishops to receive their neighbouring colleagues, who\nhad been expelled from their sees by the barbarians, Gregory confirmed\nthis command, and exhorted them to obey it. And when he himself was\nadmonished by the same emperor to be reconciled to John, the bishop of\nConstantinople, he did, indeed, assign a reason why he ought not to be\nblamed, yet he boasted no immunity exempting him from the imperial\nauthority, but on the contrary promised compliance as far as should be\nconsistent with a good conscience; and at the same time acknowledged\nthat Mauritius acted in a manner becoming a religious prince in giving\nsuch commands to the bishops.\nFootnote 1028:\n1 Cor. xii. 28.\nFootnote 1029:\nRom. xii. 8.\nFootnote 1030:\n1 Tim. v. 17.\nFootnote 1031:\nMatt. xviii. 15-18.\nFootnote 1032:\nMatt. xvi. 19.\nFootnote 1033:\nJohn xx. 22, 23.\nFootnote 1034:\nMatt. xviii. 17, 18.\nFootnote 1035:\n2 Cor. x. 5, 6.\nFootnote 1036:\n1 Cor. v. 12.\nFootnote 1037:\nMatt. xx. 25, 26.

          "content": "THE DISCIPLINE OF THE CHURCH; ITS PRINCIPAL USE IN CENSURES AND\nEXCOMMUNICATION.\nThe discipline of the Church, the discussion of which I have deferred to\nthis place, must be despatched in a few words, that we may proceed to\nthe remaining subjects. Now, the discipline depends chiefly on the power\nof the keys, and the spiritual jurisdiction. To make this more easily\nunderstood, let us divide the Church into two principal orders—the\nclergy and the people. I use the word _clergy_ as the common, though\nimproper, appellation of those who execute the public ministry in the\nChurch. We shall, first, speak of the common discipline to which all\nought to be subject; and in the next place we shall proceed to the\nclergy, who, beside this common discipline, have a discipline peculiar\nto themselves. But as some have such a hatred of discipline, as to abhor\nthe very name, they should attend to the following consideration: That\nif no society, and even no house, though containing only a small family,\ncan be preserved in a proper state without discipline, this is far more\nnecessary in the Church, the state of which ought to be the most orderly\nof all. As the saving doctrine of Christ is the soul of the Church, so\ndiscipline forms the ligaments which connect the members together, and\nkeep each in its proper place. Whoever, therefore, either desire the\nabolition of all discipline, or obstruct its restoration, whether they\nact from design or inadvertency, they certainly promote the entire\ndissolution of the Church. For what will be the consequence, if every\nman be at liberty to follow his own inclinations? But such would be the\ncase, unless the preaching of the doctrine were accompanied with private\nadmonitions, reproofs, and other means to enforce the doctrine, and\nprevent it from being altogether ineffectual. Discipline, therefore,\nserves as a bridle to curb and restrain the refractory, who resist the\ndoctrine of Christ; or as a spur to stimulate the inactive; and\nsometimes as a father’s rod, with which those who have grievously fallen\nmay be chastised in mercy, and with the gentleness of the Spirit of\nChrist. Now, when we see the approach of certain beginnings of a\ndreadful desolation in the Church, since there is no solicitude or means\nto keep the people in obedience to our Lord, necessity itself proclaims\nthe want of a remedy; and this is the only remedy which has been\ncommanded by Christ, or which has ever been adopted among believers.\nII. The first foundation of discipline consists in the use of private\nadmonitions; that is to say, that if any one be guilty of a voluntary\nomission of duty, or conduct himself in an insolent manner, or discover\na want of virtue in his life, or commit any act deserving of\nreprehension, he should suffer himself to be admonished; and that every\none should study to admonish his brother, whenever occasion shall\nrequire; but that pastors and presbyters, beyond all others, should be\nvigilant in the discharge of this duty, being called by their office,\nnot only to preach to the congregation, but also to admonish and exhort\nin private houses, if in any instances their public instructions may not\nhave been sufficiently efficacious; as Paul inculcates, when he says,\nthat he “taught publicly and from house to house,” and protests himself\nto be “pure from the blood of all men,” having “ceased not to warn every\none night and day with tears.”[1043] For the doctrine then obtains its\nfull authority, and produces its due effect, when the minister not only\ndeclares to all the people together what is their duty to Christ, but\nhas the right and means of enforcing it upon them whom he observes to be\ninattentive, or not obedient to the doctrine. If any one either\nobstinately reject such admonitions, or manifest his contempt of them by\npersisting in his misconduct; after he shall have been admonished a\nsecond time in the presence of witnesses, Christ directs him to be\nsummoned before the tribunal of the Church, that is, the assembly of the\nelders, and there to be more severely admonished by the public\nauthority, that if he reverence the Church, he may submit and obey; but\nif this do not overcome him, and he still persevere in his iniquity, our\nLord then commands him, as a despiser of the Church, to be excluded from\nthe society of believers.[1044]\nIII. But as Jesus Christ in this passage is speaking only of private\nfaults, it is necessary to make this distinction—that some sins are\nprivate, and others public or notorious. With respect to the former,\nChrist says to every private individual, “Tell him his fault between\nthee and him alone.”[1045] With respect to those which are notorious,\nPaul says to Timothy, “Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also\nmay fear.”[1046] For Christ has before said, “If thy brother shall\ntrespass against thee;” which no person who is not contentious can\nunderstand in any other sense, than if our Lord had said, “If any one\nsin against thee, and thou alone know it, without any other persons\nbeing acquainted with it.” But the direction given by the apostle to\nTimothy, to rebuke publicly those whose transgressions were public, he\nhimself exemplified in his conduct to Peter. For when Peter committed a\npublic offence, he did not admonish him in private, but brought him\nforward before all the Church.[1047] The legitimate course, then, will\nbe,—in correcting secret faults, to adopt the different steps directed\nby Christ; and in the case of those which are notorious, to proceed at\nonce to the solemn correction of the Church, especially if they be\nattended with public offence.\nIV. It is also necessary to make another distinction between different\nsins; some are smaller delinquencies, others are flagitious or enormous\ncrimes. For the correction of atrocious crimes, it is not sufficient to\nemploy admonition or reproof; recourse must be had to a severer remedy;\nas Paul shows, when he does not content himself with censuring the\nincestuous Corinthian, but pronounces sentence of excommunication\nimmediately on being certified of his crime. Now, then, we begin to have\na clearer perception how the spiritual jurisdiction of the Church, which\ncorrects sins according to the word of the Lord, is a most excellent\npreservative of health, foundation of order, and bond of unity.\nTherefore when the Church excludes from its society all who are known to\nbe guilty of adultery, fornication, theft, robbery, sedition, perjury,\nfalse witness, and other similar crimes, together with obstinate\npersons, who, after having been admonished even of smaller faults,\ncontemn God and his judgment,—it usurps no unreasonable authority, but\nonly exercises the jurisdiction which God has given it. And that no one\nmay despise this judgment of the Church, or consider it as of little\nimportance that he is condemned by the voice of the faithful, God has\ntestified that it is no other than a declaration of his sentence, and\nthat what they do on earth shall be ratified in heaven. For they have\nthe word of the Lord, to condemn the perverse; they have the word, to\nreceive the penitent into favour. Persons who believe that the Church\ncould not subsist without this bond of discipline, are mistaken in their\nopinion, unless we could safely dispense with that remedy which the Lord\nforesaw would be necessary for us; and how very necessary it is, will be\nbetter discovered from its various use.\nV. Now, there are three ends proposed by the Church in those\ncorrections, and in excommunication. The first is, that those who lead\nscandalous and flagitious lives, may not, to the dishonour of God, be\nnumbered among Christians; as if his holy Church were a conspiracy of\nwicked and abandoned men. For as the Church is the body of Christ, it\ncannot be contaminated with such foul and putrid members without some\nignominy being reflected upon the Head. That nothing may exist in the\nChurch, therefore, from which any disgrace may be thrown upon his\nvenerable name, it is necessary to expel from his family all those from\nwhose turpitude infamy would redound to the profession of Christianity.\nHere it is also necessary to have particular regard to the Lord’s\nsupper, that it may not be profaned by a promiscuous administration. For\nit is certain that he who is intrusted with the dispensation of it, if\nhe knowingly and intentionally admit an unworthy person, whom he might\njustly reject, is as guilty of sacrilege as if he were to give the\nLord’s body to dogs. Wherefore, Chrysostom severely inveighs against\npriests, who, from a fear of the great and the powerful, did not dare to\nreject any persons who presented themselves. “Blood,” says he, “shall be\nrequired at your hands. If you fear man, he will deride you; if you fear\nGod, you will also be honoured among men. Let us not be afraid of\nsceptres, or diadems, or imperial robes; we have here a great power. As\nfor myself, I will rather give up my body to death, and suffer my blood\nto be shed, than I will be partaker of this pollution.” To guard this\nmost sacred mystery, therefore, from being reproached, there is need of\ngreat discretion in the administration of it, and this requires the\njurisdiction of the Church. The second end is, that the good may not be\ncorrupted, as is often the case, by constant association with the\nwicked. For, such is our propensity to error, nothing is more easy than\nfor evil examples to seduce us from rectitude of conduct. This use of\ndiscipline was remarked by the apostle, when he directed the Corinthians\nto expel from their society a person who had been guilty of incest. “A\nlittle leaven,” says he, “leaveneth the whole lump.”[1048] And the\napostle perceived such great danger from this quarter, that he even\ninterdicted believers from all social intercourse with the wicked. “I\nhave written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a\nbrother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a\ndrunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one, no, not to eat.”[1049] The\nthird end is, that those who are censured or excommunicated, confounded\nwith the shame of their turpitude, may be led to repentance. Thus it is\neven conducive to their own benefit for their iniquity to be punished,\nthat the stroke of the rod may arouse to a confession of their guilt,\nthose who would only be rendered more obstinate by indulgence. The\napostle intends the same when he says, “If any man obey not our word,\nnote that man, and have no company with him, that he may be\nashamed.”[1050] Again, when he says of the incestuous Corinthian, “I\nhave judged to deliver such a one unto Satan, that the spirit may be\nsaved in the day of the Lord;”[1051] that is, as I understand it, that\nhe had consigned him to a temporal condemnation, that the spirit might\nbe eternally saved. He therefore calls it _delivering to Satan_, because\nthe devil is _without_ the Church, as Christ is in the Church. For the\nopinion of some persons, that it relates to a certain torment of the\nbody in the present life, inflicted by the agency of Satan, appears to\nme extremely doubtful.\nVI. Having stated these ends, it remains for us to examine how the\nChurch exercises this branch of discipline, which consists in\njurisdiction. In the first place, let us keep in view the distinction\nbefore mentioned, that some sins are public, and others private, or more\nconcealed. Public sins are those which are not only known to one or two\nwitnesses, but are committed openly, and to the scandal of the whole\nChurch. By private sins, I mean, not such as are entirely unknown to\nmen, like those of hypocrites,—for these never come under the cognizance\nof the Church,—but those of an intermediate class, which are not without\nthe knowledge of some witnesses, and yet are not public. The first sort\nrequires not the adoption of the gradual measures enumerated by Christ;\nbut it is the duty of the Church, on the occurrence of any notorious\nscandal, immediately to summon the offender, and to punish him in\nproportion to his crime. Sins of the second class, according to the rule\nof Christ, are not to be brought before the Church, unless they are\nattended with contumacy, in rejecting private admonition. When they are\nsubmitted to the cognizance of the Church, then attention is to be paid\nto the other distinction, between smaller delinquencies and more\natrocious crimes. For slighter offences require not the exertion of\nextreme severity; it is sufficient to administer verbal castigation, and\nthat with paternal gentleness, not calculated to exasperate or confound\nthe offender, but to bring him to himself, that his correction may be an\noccasion of joy rather than of sorrow. But it is proper that flagitious\ncrimes should receive severer punishment; for it is not enough for him\nwho has grievously offended the Church by the bad example of an\natrocious crime, merely to receive verbal castigation; he ought to be\ndeprived of the communion of the Lord’s supper for a time, till he shall\nhave given satisfactory evidence of repentance. For Paul not only\nemploys verbal reproof against the Corinthian transgressor, but excludes\nhim from the Church, and blames the Corinthians for having tolerated him\nso long. This order was retained in the ancient and purer Church, while\nany legitimate government continued. For if any one had perpetrated a\ncrime which was productive of offence, he was commanded, in the first\nplace, to abstain from the Lord’s supper, and, in the next place, to\nhumble himself before God, and to testify his repentance before the\nChurch. There were, likewise, certain solemn rites which it was\ncustomary to enjoin upon those who had fallen, as signs of their\nrepentance. When the sinner had performed these for the satisfaction of\nthe Church, he was then, by imposition of hands, readmitted to the\ncommunion. This readmission is frequently called _peace_ by Cyprian, who\nbriefly describes the ceremony. “They do penance,” he says, “for a\nsufficient time; then they come to confession, and by the imposition of\nthe hands of the bishop and clergy, are restored to the privilege of\ncommunion.” But though the bishop and clergy presided in the\nreconciliation of offenders, yet they required the consent of the\npeople; as Cyprian elsewhere states.\nVII. From this discipline none were exempted; so that princes and\nplebeians yielded the same submission to it; and that with the greatest\npropriety, since it is evidently the discipline of Christ, to whom it is\nreasonable that all the sceptres and diadems of kings should be subject.\nThus Theodosius, when Ambrose excluded him from the privilege of\ncommunion, on account of a massacre perpetrated at Thessalonica, laid\naside the ensigns of royalty with which he was invested, publicly in the\nChurch bewailed his sin, which the deceitful suggestions of others had\ntempted him to commit, and implored pardon with groans and tears. For\ngreat kings ought not to think it any dishonour to prostrate themselves\nas suppliants before Christ the King of kings, nor ought they to be\ndispleased at being judged by the Church. As they hear scarcely any\nthing in their courts but mere flatteries, it is the more highly\nnecessary for them to receive correction from the Lord by the mouth of\nhis _ministers_; they ought even to wish not to be spared by the\n_pastors_, that they may be spared by the Lord. I forbear to mention\nhere by whom this jurisdiction is to be exercised, having spoken of this\nin another place. I will only add, that the legitimate process in\nexcommunicating an offender, which is pointed out by Paul, requires it\nto be done, not by the elders alone, but with the knowledge and\napprobation of the Church: in such a manner, however, that the multitude\nof the people may not direct the proceeding, but may watch over it as\nwitnesses and guardians, that nothing may be done by a few persons from\nany improper motive. Beside the invocation of the name of God, the whole\nof the proceeding ought to be conducted with a gravity declarative of\nthe presence of Christ, that there may be no doubt of his presiding over\nthe sentence.\nVIII. But it ought not to be forgotten, that the severity becoming the\nChurch must be tempered with a spirit of gentleness. For there is\nconstant need of the greatest caution, according to the injunction of\nPaul respecting a person who may have been censured, “lest perhaps such\na one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow;”[1052] for thus a\nremedy would become a poison. But the rule of moderation may be better\ndeduced from the end intended to be accomplished; for as the design of\nexcommunication is, that the sinner may be brought to repentance, and\nevil examples taken away, to prevent the name of Christ from being\nblasphemed and other persons being tempted to imitation,—if we keep\nthese things in view, it will be easy to judge how far severity ought to\nproceed, and where it ought to stop. Therefore, when the sinner gives\nthe Church a testimony of his repentance, and by this testimony, as far\nas in him lies, obliterates the offence, he is by no means to be pressed\nany further; and if he be pressed any further, the rigour is carried\nbeyond its proper limits. In this respect, it is impossible to excuse\nthe excessive austerity of the ancients, which was utterly at variance\nwith the directions of the Lord, and led to the most dangerous\nconsequences. For when they sentenced an offender to solemn repentance,\nand exclusion from the holy communion, sometimes for three, sometimes\nfor four, sometimes for seven years, and sometimes for the remainder of\nlife,—what other consequence could result from it, but either great\nhypocrisy or extreme despair? In like manner, when any one had fallen a\nsecond time, the refusal to admit him to a second repentance, and his\nexclusion from the Church to the end of his life, was neither useful nor\nreasonable. Whoever considers the subject with sound judgment,\ntherefore, will discover their want of prudence in this instance. But I\nwould rather reprobate the general custom, than accuse all those who\npractised it; among whom it is certain that some were not satisfied, but\nthey complied with it because it was not in their power to effect a\nreformation. Cyprian declares that it was not from his own choice that\nhe was so rigorous. “Our patience,” he says, “and kindness and\ntenderness, is ready for all who come. I wish all to return into the\nChurch: I wish all our fellow-soldiers to be assembled in the camp of\nChrist, and all our brethren to be received into the house of God our\nFather. I forgive every thing; I conceal much; from a zealous wish to\ncollect all the brotherhood together, even the sins committed against\nGod I examine not with rigid severity; and am scarcely free from fault\nmyself, in forgiving faults more easily than I ought. With ready and\nentire affection I embrace those who return with penitence, confessing\ntheir sin with humble and sincere satisfaction.” Chrysostom is rather\nmore severe; yet he expresses himself thus: “If God is so kind, why is\nhis priest determined to be so austere?” We know, likewise, what\nkindness Augustine exercised towards the Donatists, so that he hesitated\nnot to receive into the bishoprics those who renounced their error; and\nthat immediately after their repentance. But because a contrary system\nhad prevailed, they were obliged to relinquish their own judgment, in\norder to follow the established custom.\nIX. Now, as it is required of the whole body of the Church, in\nchastising any one who has fallen, to manifest such gentleness and\nclemency as not to proceed to the extremity of rigour, but rather,\naccording to the injunction of Paul, to “confirm their love toward\nhim,”[1053] so it is the duty of every individual to moderate himself to\nthe like tenderness and clemency. Such as are expelled from the Church,\ntherefore, it is not for us to expunge from the number of the elect, or\nto despair of them as already lost. It is proper to consider them as\nstrangers to the Church, and consequently from Christ, but this only as\nlong as they remain in a state of exclusion. And even then, if they\nexhibit more appearance of obstinacy than of humility, still let us\nleave them to the judgment of God, hoping better things of them for the\nfuture than we discover at present, and not ceasing to pray to God on\ntheir behalf. And to comprehend all in a word, let us not condemn to\neternal death the person himself, who is in the hand and power of God\nalone, but let us content ourselves with judging of the nature of his\nworks according to the law of the Lord. While we follow this rule, we\nrather adhere to the judgment of God than pronounce our own. Let us not\narrogate to ourselves any greater latitude of judging, unless we would\nlimit the power and prescribe laws to the mercy of God; for, whenever it\nseems good to him, the worst of men are changed into the best, strangers\nare introduced, and foreigners are admitted into the Church. And this\nthe Lord does, to frustrate the opinion and repress the presumption of\nmen, which would usurp the most unwarrantable liberty of judging, if it\nwere left without any restraint.\nX. When Christ promises that what his ministers bind on earth shall be\nbound in heaven, he limits the power of binding to the censure of the\nChurch; by which those who are excommunicated are not cast into eternal\nruin and condemnation, but, by hearing their life and conduct condemned,\nare also certified of their final condemnation, unless they repent. For\nexcommunication differs from anathema; the latter, which ought to be\nvery rarely or never resorted to, precluding all pardon, execrates a\nperson, and devotes him to eternal perdition; whereas excommunication\nrather censures and punishes his conduct. And though it does, at the\nsame time, punish the person, yet it is in such a manner, that, by\nwarning him of his future condemnation, it recalls him to salvation. If\nhe obey, the Church is ready to re-admit him to its friendship, and to\nrestore him to its communion. Therefore, though the discipline of the\nChurch admits not of our friendly association and familiar intercourse\nwith excommunicated persons, yet we ought to exert all the means in our\npower to promote their reformation, and their return to the society and\ncommunion of the Church; as we are taught by the apostle, who says, “Yet\ncount him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.”[1054] Unless\nthis tenderness be observed by the individual members, as well as by the\nChurch collectively, our discipline will be in danger of speedily\ndegenerating into cruelty.\nXI. It is also particularly requisite to the moderation of discipline,\nas Augustine observes in disputing with the Donatists, that private\npersons, if they see faults corrected with too little diligence by the\ncouncil of elders, should not on that account immediately withdraw from\nthe Church; and that the pastors themselves, if they cannot succeed\naccording to the wishes of their hearts in reforming every thing that\nneeds correction, should not, in consequence of this, desert the\nministry, or disturb the whole Church with unaccustomed asperity. For\nthere is much truth in his observation, that “whoever either corrects\nwhat he can by reproof; or what he cannot correct, excludes, without\nbreaking the bond of peace; or what he cannot exclude, without breaking\nthe bond of peace, censures with moderation and bears with firmness; he\nis free from the curse, and chargeable with no blame.” In another\npassage he assigns the reason; because “all the pious order and method\nof ecclesiastical discipline ought constantly to regard the unity of the\nSpirit in the bond of peace; which the apostle commands to be kept by\nmutual forbearance; and without the preservation of which, the medicine\nof chastisement is not only superfluous, but even becomes pernicious,\nand consequently is no longer a medicine.” Again: “He who attentively\nconsiders these things neither neglects severity of discipline for the\npreservation of unity, nor breaks the bond of fellowship by an\nintemperance of correction.” He acknowledges indeed that it is not only\nthe duty of the pastors to endeavour to purify the Church from every\nfault, but that it is likewise incumbent on every individual to exert\nall his influence for the same purpose; and he fully admits, that a\nperson who neglects to admonish, reprove, and correct the wicked, though\nhe neither favours them nor unites in their sins, is nevertheless\nculpable in the sight of the Lord; but that he who sustains such an\noffice as to have power to exclude them from a participation of the\nsacraments, and does it not, is chargeable, in that case, not with the\nguilt of another, but with a sin of his own; he only recommends it to be\ndone with the prudence required by our Lord, “lest while” they “gather\nup the tares,” they “root up also the wheat with them.”[1055] Hence he\nconcludes with Cyprian, “Let a man, therefore, in mercy correct what he\ncan; what he cannot, let him patiently bear and affectionately lament.”\nXII. These remarks of Augustine were made in consequence of the rigour\nof the Donatists, who, seeing vices in the Church, which the bishops\ncondemned by verbal reproofs, but did not punish with excommunication,\nwhich they thought not adapted to produce any good effects, inveighed in\na most outrageous manner against the bishops, as betrayers of\ndiscipline, and by an impious schism separated themselves from the flock\nof Christ. The same conduct is pursued in the present day by the\nAnabaptists, who, acknowledging no congregation to belong to Christ,\nunless it be, in all respects, conspicuous for angelic perfection, under\nthe pretext of zeal, destroy all edification. “Such persons,” says\nAugustine, “not actuated by hatred against the iniquity of others, but\nstimulated by fondness for their own disputes, desire either wholly to\npervert, or at least to divide the weak multitude by insnaring them with\ntheir boastful pretensions; inflated with pride, infuriated with\nobstinacy, insidious with calumnies, turbulent with seditions, that\ntheir destitution of the light of truth may not be detected, they\nconceal themselves under the covert of a rigorous severity; and those\nthings which the Scripture commands to be done for the correction of the\nfaults of our brethren, without violating the sincerity of love, or\ndisturbing the unity of peace, but with the moderation of a remedial\nprocess, they abuse, to an occasion of dissension and to the sacrilege\nof schism. Thus Satan transforms himself into an angel of light, when\nfrom just severity he takes occasion to persuade men to inhuman cruelty,\nwith no other object than to corrupt and break the bond of peace and\nunity; by the preservation of which among Christians, all his power to\ninjure them is weakened, his insidious snares are broken, and his\nschemes for their ruin come to nothing.”\nXIII. There is one thing which this father particularly recommends—that\nif the contagion of any sin has infected a whole people, there is a\nnecessity for the severity and mercy which are combined in strict\ndiscipline. “For schemes of separation,” he says, “are pernicious and\nsacrilegious, because they proceed from pride and impiety, and disturb\nthe good who are weak, more than they correct the wicked who are bold.”\nAnd what he here prescribes to others, he faithfully followed himself.\nFor writing to Aurelius, bishop of Carthage, he complained that\ndrunkenness, which is so severely condemned in the Scripture, prevailed\nwith impunity in Africa, and persuaded him to endeavour to remedy it by\ncalling a provincial council. He immediately adds, “I believe these\nthings are suppressed not by harshness, severity, or imperiousness, but\nby teaching rather than commanding, by admonitions rather than by\nmenaces. For this is the conduct to be pursued with a multitude of\noffenders; but severity is to be exercised against the sins of a few.”\nYet he does not mean that bishops should connive or be silent, because\nthey cannot inflict severe punishments for public crimes, as he\nafterwards explains; but he means that the correction should be tempered\nwith such moderation, as to be salutary rather than injurious to the\nbody. And therefore he at length concludes in the following manner:\n“Wherefore, also, that command of the apostle, to put away the\nwicked,[1056] ought by no means to be neglected, when it can be done\nwithout danger of disturbing the peace; for in this case alone did he\nintend that it should be enforced; and we are also to observe his other\ninjunction, to forbear one another in love, endeavouring to keep the\nunity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”[1057]\nXIV. The remaining part of discipline, which is not strictly included in\nthe power of the keys, consists in this—that the pastors, according to\nthe necessity of the times, should exhort the people either to fastings\nor solemn supplications, or to other exercises of humility, repentance,\nand faith, of which the word of God prescribes neither the time, the\nextent, nor the form, but leaves all this to the judgment of the Church.\nThe observation of these things, also, which are highly useful, was\nalways practised by the ancient Church from the days of the apostles;\nthough the apostles themselves were not the first authors of them, but\nderived the example from the law and the prophets. For there we find,\nthat whenever any important business occurred, the people were\nassembled, supplications commanded, and fasting enjoined. The apostles,\ntherefore, followed what was not new to the people of God, and what they\nforesaw would be useful. The same reasoning is applicable to other\nexercises by which the people may be excited to duty, or preserved in\nobedience. Examples abound in the sacred history, which it is\nunnecessary to enumerate. The conclusion to be deduced from the whole\nis, that whenever a controversy arises respecting religion, which\nrequires to be decided by a council or ecclesiastical judgment; whenever\na minister is to be chosen; in short, whenever any thing of difficulty\nor great importance is transacting; and also when any tokens of the\nDivine wrath are discovered, such as famine, pestilence, or war;—it is a\npious custom, and beneficial in all ages, for the pastors to exhort the\npeople to public fasts and extraordinary prayers. If the testimonies\nwhich may be adduced from the Old Testament be rejected, as inapplicable\nto the Christian church, it is evident that the apostles practised the\nsame. Respecting prayers, however, I suppose scarcely a person will be\nfound disposed to raise any dispute. Therefore let us say something of\nfasting; because many, for want of knowing its usefulness, undervalue\nits necessity, and some reject it as altogether superfluous; while, on\nthe other hand, where the use of it is not well understood, it easily\ndegenerates into superstition.\nXV. Holy and legitimate fasting is directed to three ends. For we\npractise it, either as a restraint on the flesh, to preserve it from\nlicentiousness, or as a preparation for prayers and pious meditations,\nor as a testimony of our humiliation in the presence of God, when we are\ndesirous of confessing our guilt before him. The first is not often\ncontemplated in public fasting, because all men have not the same\nconstitution or health of body; therefore it is rather more applicable\nto private fasting. The second end is common to both, such preparation\nfor prayer being necessary to the whole Church, as well as to every one\nof the faithful in particular. The same may be said of the third. For it\nwill sometimes happen that God will afflict a whole nation with war,\npestilence, or some other calamity; under such a common scourge, it\nbehoves all the people to make a confession of their guilt. When the\nhand of the Lord chastises an individual, he ought to make a similar\nconfession, either alone or with his family. It is true that this\nacknowledgment lies principally in the disposition of the heart; but\nwhen the heart is affected as it ought to be, it can scarcely avoid\nbreaking out into the external expression, and most especially when it\npromotes the general edification; in order that all, by a public\nconfession of their sin, may unitedly acknowledge the justice of God,\nand may mutually animate each other by the influence of example.\nXVI. Wherefore fasting, as it is a sign of humiliation, is of more\nfrequent use in public, than among individuals in private; though it is\ncommon to both, as we have already observed. With regard to the\ndiscipline, therefore, of which we are now treating, whenever\nsupplications are to be presented to God on any important occasion, it\nwould be right to enjoin the union of fasting with prayer. Thus when the\nbelievers at Antioch “laid their hands on Paul and Barnabas,” the better\nto recommend their very important ministry to God, they “fasted” as well\nas “prayed.”[1058] So also when Paul and Barnabas afterwards “ordained\nelders in every Church,” they used to “pray with fasting.”[1059] In this\nkind of fasting, their only object was, that they might be more lively\nand unembarrassed in prayer. And we find by experience, that after a\nfull meal, the mind does not aspire towards God so as to be able to\nenter on prayer, and to continue in it with seriousness and ardour of\naffection. So we are to understand what Luke says of Anna, that she\n“served God with fastings and prayers.”[1060] For he does not place the\nworship of God in fasting, but signifies that by such means that holy\nwoman habituated herself to a constancy in prayer. Such was the fasting\nof Nehemiah, when he prayed to God with more than common fervour for the\ndeliverance of his people.[1061] For this cause Paul declares it to be\nexpedient for believers to practise a temporary abstinence from lawful\nenjoyments, that they may be more at liberty to “give themselves to\nfasting and prayer.”[1062] For by connecting fasting with prayer as an\nassistance to it, he signifies that fasting is of no importance in\nitself, any further than as it is directed to this end. Besides, from\nthe direction which he gives in that place to husbands and wives, to\n“render to” each other “due benevolence,” it is clear that he is not\nspeaking of daily prayers, but of such as require peculiar earnestness\nof attention.\nXVII. In like manner, when war, pestilence, or famine begins to rage, or\nwhen any other calamity appears to threaten a country and people, then\nalso it is the duty of pastors to exhort the Church to fasting, that\nwith humble supplications they may deprecate the wrath of the Lord; for\nwhen he causes danger to appear, he announces himself as prepared and\narmed for vengeance. Therefore, as it was anciently the custom for\ncriminals to appear with long beards, dishevelled hair, and mourning\napparel, in order to excite the pity of the judge; so when we stand as\ncriminals before the tribunal of God, it is conducive to his glory and\nthe general edification, as well as expedient and salutary for\nourselves, to deprecate his severity by external demonstrations of\nsorrow. That this was customary among the people of Israel, it is easy\nto infer from the language of Joel; for when he commands to “blow the\ntrumpet, sanctify a fast, and call a solemn assembly,”[1063] and\nproceeds to give other directions, he speaks as of things commonly\npractised. He had just before said that inquisition was made respecting\nthe crimes of the people, had announced that the day of the Lord was at\nhand, and had cited them, as criminals, to appear and answer for\nthemselves; afterwards, he warns them to have recourse to sackcloth and\nashes, to weeping and fasting, that is, to prostrate themselves before\nthe Lord with external demonstrations of humility. Sackcloth and ashes,\nperhaps, were more suitable to those times; but there is no doubt that\nassembling, and weeping, and fastings, and similar acts, are equally\nproper for us in the present age, whenever the state of our affairs\nrequires them. For as it is a holy exercise, adapted both to humble men\nand to confess their humility, why should it be less used by us than by\nthe ancients in similar necessities? We read that fasting in token of\nsorrow was not only practised by the Israelitish Church, which was\nformed and regulated by the word of God, but also by the inhabitants of\nNineveh, who had no instruction except the preaching of Jonah.[1064]\nWhat cause, then, is there, why we should not practise the same? But, it\nwill be said, it is an external ceremony, which, with all the rest,\nterminated in Christ. I reply, that even at this day it is, as it always\nhas been, a most excellent assistance and useful admonition to believers\nto stimulate them, and guard them against further provocations of God by\ntheir carelessness and inattention, when they are chastised by his\nscourges. Therefore, when Christ excuses his apostles for not fasting,\nhe does not say that fasting is abolished, but appoints it for seasons\nof calamity, and connects it with sorrow. “The days will come,” says he,\n“when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them.”[1065]\nXVIII. That there may be no mistake respecting the term, let us define\nwhat fasting is. For we do not understand it to denote mere temperance\nand abstinence in eating and drinking, but something more. The life of\nbelievers, indeed, ought to be so regulated by frugality and sobriety,\nas to exhibit, as far as possible, the appearance of a perpetual fast.\nBut beside this, there is another temporary fast, when we retrench any\nthing from our customary mode of living, either for a day or for any\ncertain time, and prescribe to ourselves a more than commonly rigid and\nsevere abstinence in food. This restriction consists in three things,—in\ntime, in quality, and in quantity of food. By time, I mean that we\nshould perform, while fasting, those exercises on account of which fasts\nare instituted. As, for example, if any one fast for solemn prayer, he\nshould not break his fast till he has attended to it. The quality\nconsists in an entire abstinence from dainties, and contentment with\nsimpler and humbler fare, that our appetite may not be stimulated by\ndelicacies. The rule of quantity is, that we eat more sparingly and\nslightly than usual, only for necessity, and not for pleasure.\nXIX. But it is necessary for us, above all things, to be particularly on\nour guard against the approaches of superstition, which has heretofore\nbeen a source of great injury to the Church. For it were far better that\nfasting should be entirely disused, than that the practice should be\ndiligently observed, and at the same time corrupted with false and\npernicious opinions, into which the world is continually falling, unless\nit be prevented by the greatest fidelity and prudence of the pastors.\nThe first caution necessary, and which they should be constantly urging,\nis that suggested by Joel: “Rend your heart, and not your\ngarments;”[1066] that is, they should admonish the people, that God sets\nno value on fasting, unless it be accompanied with a correspondent\ndisposition of heart, a real displeasure against sin, sincere\nself-abhorrence, true humiliation, and unfeigned grief arising from a\nfear of God; and that fasting is of no use on any other account than as\nan additional and subordinate assistance to these things. For nothing is\nmore abominable to God, than when men attempt to impose upon him by the\npresentation of signs and external appearances instead of purity of\nheart. Therefore he severely reprobates this hypocrisy in the Jews, who\nimagined they had satisfied God merely by having fasted, while they\ncherished impious and impure thoughts in their hearts. “Is it such a\nfast, saith the Lord, that I have chosen?”[1067] The fasting of\nhypocrites, therefore, is not only superfluous and useless fatigue, but\nthe greatest abomination. Allied to this is another evil, which requires\nthe most vigilant caution, lest it be considered as a meritorious act,\nor a species of divine service. For as it is a thing indifferent in\nitself, and possesses no other value than it derives from those ends to\nwhich it ought to be directed, it is most pernicious superstition to\nconfound it with works commanded by God, and necessary in themselves,\nwithout reference to any ulterior object. Such was formerly the folly of\nthe Manichæans, in the refutation of whom Augustine most clearly shows,\nthat fasting is to be held in no other estimation than on account of\nthose ends which I here mention, and that it receives no approbation\nfrom God, unless it be practised for their sake. The third error is not\nso impious, indeed, yet it is pregnant with danger, to enforce it with\nextreme rigour as one of the principal duties, and to extol it with\nextravagant encomiums, so that men imagine themselves to have performed\na work of peculiar excellence when they have fasted. In this respect, I\ndare not wholly excuse the ancient fathers from having sown some seeds\nof superstition, and given occasion to the tyranny which afterwards\narose. Their writings contain some sound and judicious sentiments on the\nsubject of fasting; but they also contain extravagant praises, which\nelevate it to a rank among the principal virtues.\nXX. And the superstitious observance of Lent had at that time generally\nprevailed, because the common people considered themselves as performing\nan eminent act of obedience to God, and the pastors commended it as a\nholy imitation of Christ; whereas it is plain that Christ fasted, not to\nset an example to others, but in order that by such an introduction to\nthe preaching of the gospel, he might prove the doctrine not to be a\nhuman invention, but a revelation from heaven. And it is surprising that\nmen of acute discernment could ever entertain such a gross error, which\nis disproved by such numerous and satisfactory arguments. For Christ did\nnot fast often, which it was necessary for him to do, if he intended to\nestablish a law for anniversary fasts, but only once, while he was\npreparing to enter on the promulgation of the gospel. Nor did he fast in\nthe manner of men, as it behoved him to do, if he intended to stimulate\nmen to an imitation of him: on the contrary, he exhibited an example\ncalculated to attract the admiration of all, rather than to excite them\nto a desire of emulating his example. In short, there was no other\nreason for his fasting than for that of Moses, when he received the law\nfrom the hand of the Lord. For as that miracle was exhibited in Moses,\nto establish the authority of the law, it was necessary that it should\nnot be omitted in Christ, lest the gospel should seem to be inferior to\nthe law. But from that time, it never entered into any man’s mind to\nintroduce such a form of fasting among the people of Israel, under the\npretext of imitating Moses; nor was it followed by any of the holy\nprophets and fathers, notwithstanding their inclination and zeal for all\npious exercises. For the account of Elijah, that he lived forty days\nwithout meat and drink, was only intended to teach the people that he\nwas raised up to be the restorer of the law, from which almost all\nIsrael had departed. It was nothing but a vain and superstitious\naffectation, therefore, to dignify the fasting of Lent with the title\nand pretext of an imitation of Christ. In the manner of fasting,\nhowever, there was at that time a great diversity, as Cassiodorus\nrelates from Socrates, in the ninth book of his history. “For the\nRomans,” he says, “had no more than three weeks; but during these there\nwas a continual fast, except on the Sunday and Saturday. The Illyrians\nand Greeks had six weeks, and others had seven; but they fasted at\nintervals. Nor did they differ less as to the nature of their food. Some\nmade use of nothing but bread and water; others added vegetables to\nfish; some did not abstain from fowl; others made no distinction at all\nbetween any kinds of food.” This diversity is also mentioned by\nAugustine, in his second epistle to Januarius.\nXXI. The times which followed were still worse; to the preposterous zeal\nof the multitude was added the ignorance and stupidity of the bishops,\nwith their lust of dominion and tyrannical rigour. Impious laws were\nenacted to bind men’s consciences with fatal chains. The eating of\nanimal food was interdicted, as though it would contaminate them.\nSacrilegious opinions were added one after another, till they arrived at\nan ocean of errors. And that no corruption might be omitted, they have\nbegun to trifle with God by the most ridiculous pretensions to\nabstinence. For in the midst of all the most exquisite delicacies, they\nseek the praise of fasting; no dainties are then sufficient; they never\nhave food in greater plenty, or variety, or deliciousness. Such splendid\nprovision they call fasting, and imagine it to be the legitimate service\nof God. I say nothing of the base gluttony practised at that season,\nmore than at any other time, by those who wish to pass for the greatest\nsaints. In short they esteem it the highest worship of God to abstain\nfrom animal food, and with this exception, to indulge themselves in\nevery kind of dainties. On the other hand, to taste the least morsel of\nbacon or salted meat and brown bread, they deem an act of the vilest\nimpiety, and deserving of worse than death. Jerome relates, that there\nwere some persons, even in his time, who trifled with God by such\nfooleries; who, to avoid making use of oil, procured the most delicate\nkinds of food to be brought from every country; and who, to do violence\nto nature, abstained from drinking water, but procured delicious and\ncostly liquors to be made for them, which they drank, not from a cup,\nbut from a shell. What was then the vice of a few, is now become common\namong all wealthy persons; they fast for no other purpose than to feast\nwith more than common sumptuousness and delicacy. But I have no\ninclination to waste many words on a thing so notorious. I only assert,\nthat neither in their fastings, nor in any other parts of their\ndiscipline, have the Papists any thing so correct, sincere, or well\nregulated, as to have the least occasion to pride themselves upon any\nthing being left among them worthy of praise.\nXXII. There remains the second part of the discipline of the Church,\nwhich particularly relates to the clergy. It is contained in the canons\nwhich the ancient bishops imposed on themselves and their order; such as\nthese: That no ecclesiastic should employ his time in hunting, gambling,\nor feasting; that no one should engage in usury or commerce; that no one\nshould be present at dissolute dances; and other similar injunctions.\nPenalties were likewise annexed, to confirm the authority of the canons,\nand to prevent their being violated with impunity. For this end, to\nevery bishop was committed the government of his clergy, to rule them\naccording to the canons, and to oblige them to do their duty. For this\npurpose were instituted annual visitations and synods, that if any one\nwere negligent in his duty, he might be admonished, and that any one who\ncommitted a fault might be corrected according to his offence. The\nbishops also had their provincial councils, once every year, and\nanciently even twice a year, by which they were judged, if they had\ncommitted any breach of their duty. For if a bishop was too severe or\nviolent against his clergy, there was a right of appeal to the\nprovincial councils, even though there was only a single complainant.\nThe severest punishment was the deposition of the offender from his\noffice, and his exclusion for a time from the communion. And because\nthis was a perpetual regulation, they never used to dissolve a\nprovincial council without appointing a time and place for the next.\nFor, to summon a universal council, was the exclusive prerogative of the\nemperor, as all the ancient records testify. As long as this severity\ncontinued, the clergy required nothing more from the people than they\nexemplified in their own conduct. Indeed, they were far more severe to\nthemselves than to the laity; and it is reasonable that the people\nshould be ruled with a milder and less rigid discipline; and that the\nclergy should inflict heavier censures, and exercise far less indulgence\nto themselves than to other persons. How all this has become obsolete,\nit is unnecessary to relate, when nothing can be imagined more\nlicentious and dissolute than this order of men in the present day; and\ntheir profligacy has gone to such a length, that the whole world is\nexclaiming against them. That all antiquity may not appear to have been\nentirely forgotten by them, I confess, they deceive the eyes of the\nsimple with certain shadows, but these bear no more resemblance to the\nancient usages, than the mimicry of an ape to the rational and\nconsiderate conduct of men. There is a remarkable passage in Xenophon,\nwhere he states how shamefully the Persians had degenerated from the\nvirtues of their ancestors, and, from an austere course of life, had\nsunk into delicacy and effeminacy, but that, to conceal their shame,\nthey sedulously observed the ancient forms. For whereas, in the time of\nCyrus, sobriety and temperance were carried so far, that it was\nunnecessary, and was even considered as a disgrace for any one to blow\nhis nose, their posterity continued scrupulously to refrain from this\nact; but to absorb the mucus, and retain the fetid humours produced by\ntheir gluttony, even till they almost putrefied, was held quite\nallowable. So, according to the ancient rule, it was unlawful to bring\ncups to the table; but they had no objection to drink wine till they\nwere obliged to be carried away drunk. It had been an established custom\nto eat only one meal a day; these good successors had not abolished this\ncustom, but they had continued their banquets from noon to midnight.\nBecause their ancient law enjoined men to finish their day’s journey\nfasting, it continued to be a permanent custom among them; but they were\nat liberty, and it was the general practice, for the sake of avoiding\nfatigue, to contract the journey to two hours. Whenever the Papists\nbring forward their degenerate rules, for the purpose of showing their\nresemblance to the holy fathers, this example will sufficiently expose\ntheir ridiculous imitation, of which no painter could draw a more\nstriking likeness.\nXXIII. In one instance, they are too rigorous and inflexible, that is,\nin not permitting priests to marry. With what impunity fornication rages\namong them, it is unnecessary to remark; imboldened by their polluted\ncelibacy, they have become hardened to every crime. Yet this prohibition\nclearly shows how pestilent are all their traditions; since it has not\nonly deprived the Church of upright and able pastors, but has formed a\nhorrible gulf of enormities, and precipitated many souls into the abyss\nof despair. The interdiction of marriage to priests was certainly an act\nof impious tyranny, not only contrary to the word of God, but at\nvariance with every principle of justice. In the first place, it was on\nno account lawful for men to prohibit that which the Lord had left free.\nSecondly, that God had expressly provided in his word that this liberty\nshould not be infringed, is too clear to require much proof. I say\nnothing of the direction, repeatedly given by Paul, that a bishop should\nbe “the husband of one wife;”[1068] but what could be expressed with\ngreater force, than where he announces a revelation from the Holy\nSpirit, “that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,\nforbidding to marry,” and represents these not only as impostors, but as\ndisseminating “doctrines of devils.”[1069] This, therefore, was a\nprophecy, a sacred oracle of the Holy Spirit, by which he intended from\nthe beginning to forearm the Church against dangers—that the prohibition\nof marriage is a doctrine of devils. But our adversaries imagine\nthemselves to have admirably evaded this charge, when they misapply it\nto Montanus, the Tatianists, Encratites, and other ancient heretics. It\nrefers, say they, to those who have condemned marriage altogether; we by\nno means condemn it; we merely prohibit it to the clergy, from an\nopinion that it is not proper for them. As if, though this prophecy had\nonce been accomplished in those ancient heretics, it might not also be\napplicable to them; or as if this puerile cavil, that they do not\nprohibit marriage, because they do not prohibit it to all, were\ndeserving of the least attention. This is just as if a tyrant should\ncontend that there can be no injustice in a law, the injustice of which\nonly oppresses one part of a nation.\nXXIV. They object, that there ought to be some mark to distinguish the\nclergy from the laity. As though the Lord did not foresee what are the\ntrue ornaments in which priests ought to excel. By this plea, they\ncharge the apostle with disturbing the order and violating the decorum\nof the Church, who, in delineating the perfect model of a good bishop,\namong the other virtues which he required in him, dared to mention\nmarriage. I know that they interpret this to mean, that no one is chosen\na bishop who shall have had a second wife. And I grant that this\ninterpretation is not new; but that it is erroneous, is evident from the\ncontext itself; because he immediately after prescribes what characters\nthe wives of bishops and deacons ought to possess. Paul places marriage\namong the virtues of a bishop; these men teach that it is a vice not to\nbe tolerated in the clergy; and not content with this general censure,\nthey call it carnal pollution and impurity, which is the language of\nSyricius, one of the pontiffs, recited in their canons. Let every man\nreflect from what source these things can have proceeded. Christ has\nbeen pleased to put such honour upon marriage, as to make it an image of\nhis sacred union with the Church. What could be said more, in\ncommendation of the dignity of marriage? With what face can that be\ncalled impure and polluted, which exhibits a similitude of the spiritual\ngrace of Christ?\nXXV. Now, though their prohibition is so clearly repugnant to the word\nof God, yet they find something in the Scriptures to urge in its\ndefence. The Levitical priests, whenever it came to their turn to\nminister at the altar, were required not to cohabit with their wives,\nthat they might be pure and immaculate to perform the sacrifices; it\nwould therefore be exceedingly unbecoming for our sacraments, which are\nfar more excellent and of daily recurrence, to be administered by\nmarried men. As though the evangelical ministry and the Levitical\npriesthood were one and the same office. On the contrary, the Levitical\npriests were antitypes, representing Christ, who, as the Mediator\nbetween God and man, was to reconcile the Father to us by his perfect\npurity. Now, as it was impossible for sinners to exhibit in every\nrespect a type of his sanctity, yet in order to display some faint\nshadows of it, they were commanded to purify themselves in a manner\nbeyond what is common among men, whenever they approached the sanctuary;\nbecause on those occasions they properly represented Christ, in\nappearing at the tabernacle, which was a type of the heavenly tribunal,\nas mediators to reconcile the people to God. As the pastors of the\nChurch now sustain no such office, the comparison is nothing to the\npurpose. Wherefore the apostle, without any exception, confidently\npronounces, that “marriage is honourable in all; but whoremongers and\nadulterers God will judge.”[1070] And the apostles themselves have\nproved by their own example that marriage is not unbecoming the sanctity\nof any office, however excellent; for Paul testifies that they not only\nretained their wives, but took them about with them.[1071]\nXXVI. It has also betrayed egregious impudence, to insist on this\nappearance of chastity as a necessary thing, to the great disgrace of\nthe ancient Church, which abounded with such peculiar Divine knowledge,\nbut was still more eminent for sanctity. For if they pay no regard to\nthe apostles, whom they often have the hardihood to treat with contempt,\nwhat will they say of all the ancient fathers, who, it is certain, not\nonly tolerated marriage in bishops, but likewise approved of it? It\nwould follow that they must have practised a foul profanation of sacred\nthings, since, according to the notion we are opposing, they did not\ncelebrate the mysteries of the Lord with the requisite purity. The\ninjunction of celibacy was agitated in the council of Nice; for there\nare never wanting little minds, absorbed in superstition, who endeavour\nto make themselves admired by the invention of some novelty. But what\nwas the decision? The council coincided in the opinion of Paphnutius,\nwho pronounced that “a man’s cohabitation with his own wife is\nchastity.” Therefore marriage continued to be held sacred among them,\nnor was it esteemed any disgrace to them, or considered as casting any\nblemish on the ministry.\nXXVII. Afterwards followed times distinguished by a too superstitious\nadmiration of celibacy. Hence those frequent and extravagant encomiums\non virginity, with which scarcely any other virtue was in general deemed\nworthy to be compared. And though marriage was not condemned as impure,\nyet its dignity was so diminished, and its sanctity obscured, that he\nwho did not refrain from it was not considered as aspiring to perfection\nwith sufficient fortitude of mind. Hence those canons, which prohibited\nthe contraction of marriage by those who had already entered on the\noffice of priests; and succeeding ones, which prohibited the admission\nto that office of any but those who had never been married, or who had\nabjured all cohabitation with their wives. Because these things seemed\nto add respectability to the priesthood, they were received, I confess,\neven in early times, with great applause. But our adversaries object\nantiquity against us. I answer, In the first place, in the days of the\napostles, and for several ages after, the bishops were at liberty to\nmarry; and the apostles themselves, as well as other pastors of the\nhighest reputation who succeeded them, made use of this liberty without\nany difficulty. The example of the primitive Church we ought to hold in\nhigher estimation than to deem that unlawful or unbecoming which was\nthen received and practised with approbation. Secondly; even that age,\nwhich, from a superstitious attachment to virginity, began to be more\nunfavourable to marriage, did not impose the law of celibacy upon the\npriests as if it were absolutely necessary, but because they preferred\ncelibacy to marriage. Lastly; this law did not require the compulsion of\ncontinence in those who were not able to keep it; for while the severest\npunishments were denounced on priests who were guilty of fornication,\nthose who married were merely dismissed from their office.\nXXVIII. Therefore, whenever the advocates of this modern tyranny attempt\nto defend their celibacy with the pretext of antiquity, we shall not\nfail to reply, that they ought to restore the ancient chastity in their\npriests, to remove all adulterers and fornicators, not to suffer those,\nwhom they forbid the virtuous and chaste society of a wife, to abandon\nthemselves with impunity to every kind of debauchery, to revive the\nobsolete discipline by which all indecencies may be repressed, to\ndeliver the Church from this flagitious turpitude, by which it has been\nso long deformed. When they shall have granted this, it will still be\nnecessary to admonish them not to impose that as necessary, which, being\nfree in itself, depends on the convenience of the Church. Yet I have not\nmade these observations from an opinion that we ought on any condition\nto admit those canons which impose the obligation of celibacy on the\nclergy, but to enable the more judicious to perceive the effrontery of\nour adversaries in alleging the authority of antiquity to bring disgrace\non holy marriage in priests. With respect to the fathers, whose writings\nare extant, with the exception of Jerome, they have not so malignantly\ndetracted from the virtue of marriage, when they have been expressing\ntheir own sentiments. We shall content ourselves with one testimony of\nChrysostom, because he, who was a principal admirer of virginity, cannot\nbe supposed to have been more lavish than others in commendation of\nmarriage. He says, “The first degree of chastity is pure virginity; the\nsecond is faithful marriage. Therefore the second species of virginity\nis the chaste love of matrimony.”\nFootnote 1043:\nActs xx. 20, 26, 31.\nFootnote 1044:\nMatt. xviii. 15-17.\nFootnote 1045:\nMatt. xviii. 15.\nFootnote 1046:\n1 Tim. v. 20.\nFootnote 1047:\nGal. ii. 11, 14.\nFootnote 1048:\n1 Cor. v. 6.\nFootnote 1049:\n1 Cor. v. 11.\nFootnote 1050:\n2 Thess. iii. 14.\nFootnote 1051:\n1 Cor. v. 3, 5.\nFootnote 1052:\n2 Cor. ii. 7.\nFootnote 1053:\n2 Cor. ii. 8.\nFootnote 1054:\n2 Thess. iii. 15.\nFootnote 1055:\nMatt. xiii. 29.\nFootnote 1056:\n1 Cor. v. 13.\nFootnote 1057:\nEph. iv. 2, 3.\nFootnote 1058:\nActs xiii. 2, 3.\nFootnote 1059:\nActs xiv. 23.\nFootnote 1060:\nLuke ii. 37.\nFootnote 1061:\nNeh. i. 4.\nFootnote 1062:\n1 Cor. vii. 5.\nFootnote 1063:\nJoel ii. 15.\nFootnote 1064:\nJonah iii. 5.\nFootnote 1065:\nMatt. ix. 15.

          "title": "CHAPTER XIII.",
          "content": "VOWS: THE MISERY OF RASHLY MAKING THEM.\nIt is a thing truly to be deplored, that the Church, after its liberty\nhad been purchased by the inestimable price of the blood of Christ,\nshould have been so oppressed with a cruel tyranny, and almost\noverwhelmed with an immense mass of traditions; but the general frenzy\nof individuals shows that it has not been without the justest cause,\nthat God has permitted so much to be done by Satan and his ministers.\nFor it was not sufficient for them to neglect the command of Christ, and\nto endure every burden imposed on them by false teachers, unless they\nrespectively added some of their own, and so sunk themselves deeper in\npits of their own digging. This was the consequence of their rivalling\neach other in the contrivance of vows to add a stronger and stricter\nobligation to the common bonds. As we have shown that the service of God\nwas corrupted by the audacity of those who domineered over the Church\nunder the title of pastors, insnaring unhappy consciences with their\nunjust laws; it will not be irrelevant here to expose a kindred evil, in\norder to show that men, in the depravity of their hearts, have opposed\nevery possible obstacle to those means by which they ought to have been\nconducted to God. Now, to make it more evident that vows have been\nproductive of the most serious mischiefs, it is necessary to remind the\nreaders of the principles already stated. In the first place, we have\nshown that every thing necessary to the regulation of a pious and holy\nlife is comprehended in the law. We have also shown, that the Lord, in\norder to call us off more effectually from the contrivance of new works,\nhas included all the praise of righteousness in simple obedience to his\nwill. If these things be true, the conclusion is obvious, that all the\nservices which we invent for the purpose of gaining the favour of God,\nare not at all acceptable to him, whatever pleasure they may afford to\nourselves; and, in fact, the Lord himself, in various places, not only\nopenly rejects them, but declares them to be objects of his utter\nabomination. Hence arises a doubt respecting vows which are made without\nthe authority of the express word of God, in what light they are to be\nconsidered; whether they may be rightly made by Christian men, and how\nfar they are obligatory upon them. For what is styled a _promise_ among\nmen, in reference to God is called a _vow_. Now, we promise to men\neither such things as we think will be agreeable to them, or such as we\nowe them on the ground of duty. There is need, therefore, of far greater\ncare respecting vows, which are addressed to God himself, towards whom\nwe ought to act with the utmost seriousness. But here superstition has\nprevailed, in all ages, to a wonderful degree, so that, without judgment\nor discretion, men have precipitately vowed to God whatever was\nuppermost in their minds, or even on their lips. Hence those fooleries,\nand even monstrous absurdities of vows, by which the heathen insolently\ntrifled with their gods. And I sincerely wish that Christians had not\nimitated them in such audacity. This ought never to have been the case;\nbut we see, that for several ages nothing has been more common than this\npresumption; amidst the general contempt of the law of God, people have\nbeen all inflamed with a mad passion for vowing whatever had delighted\nthem in their dreams. I have no wish to proceed to an odious\nexaggeration, or a particular enumeration of the enormity and varieties\nof this offence; but I have thought it proper to make these remarks by\nthe way, to show that we are not instituting an unnecessary discussion,\nwhen we treat of vows.\nII. If we would avoid any error in judging what vows are legitimate, and\nwhat are preposterous, it is necessary to consider three things—first,\nto whom vows are to be addressed; secondly, who we are that make vows;\nlastly, with what intention vows are made. The first consideration calls\nus to reflect, that we have to do with God; who takes such pleasure in\nour obedience, that he pronounces a curse on all acts of will-worship,\nhowever specious and splendid they may be in the eyes of men. If God\nabominates all voluntary services invented by us without his command, it\nfollows, that nothing can be acceptable to him, except what is approved\nby his word. Let us not, therefore, assume to ourselves such a great\nliberty, as to presume to vow to God any thing that has no testimony of\nhis approbation. For the maxim of Paul, that “whatsoever is not of faith\nis sin,”[1072] while it extends to every action, is without doubt\nprincipally applicable when a man addresses his thoughts directly to\nGod. Paul is there arguing respecting the difference of meats; and if we\nerr and fall even in things of the least moment, where we are not\nenlightened by the certainty of faith, how much greater modesty is\nrequisite when we are undertaking a business of the greatest importance!\nFor nothing ought to be of greater importance to us than the duties of\nreligion. Let this, then, be our first rule in regard to vows—never to\nattempt vowing any thing without a previous conviction of conscience,\nthat we are attempting nothing rashly. And our conscience will be secure\nfrom all danger of rashness, when it shall have God for its guide,\ndictating, as it were, by his word, what it is proper or useless to do.\nIII. The second consideration which we have mentioned, calls us to\nmeasure our strength, to contemplate our calling, and not to neglect the\nliberty which God has conferred on us. For he who vows what is not in\nhis power, or is repugnant to his calling, is chargeable with rashness;\nand he who despises the favour of God, by which he is constituted lord\nof all things, is guilty of ingratitude. By this remark, I do not intend\nthat we have any thing in our power, so as to enable us to promise it to\nGod in a reliance on our own strength. For, with the strictest regard to\ntruth, it was decreed in the council of Arausium, that nothing is\nrightly vowed to God but what we have received from his hand, seeing\nthat all the things which are presented to him are merely gifts which he\nhas imparted. But as some things are given to us by the goodness of God,\nand other things are denied to us by his justice, let every man follow\nthe admonition of Paul, and consider the measure of grace which he has\nreceived.[1073] My only meaning here, therefore, is, that vows ought to\nbe regulated by that measure which the Lord prescribes to us, by what he\nhas given us; lest, by attempting more than he permits, we precipitate\nourselves into danger, by arrogating too much to ourselves. Luke gives\nus an example in those assassins who vowed “that they would neither eat\nnor drink till they had killed Paul:”[1074] even though the design\nitself had not been criminal, yet it would have betrayed intolerable\nrashness, to make a man’s life and death subject to their power. So\nJephthah suffered the punishment of his folly, when, in the fervour of\nprecipitation, he made an inconsiderate vow.[1075] In vows of this\nclass, distinguished by mad presumption, that of celibacy holds the\npreëminence. Priests, monks, and nuns, forgetting their infirmity, think\nthemselves capable of celibacy. But by what revelation have they been\ntaught that they shall preserve their chastity all their lifetime, to\nthe end of which their vow reaches? They hear the declaration of God\nconcerning the universal condition of man; “It is not good for man to be\nalone.”[1076] They understand, and I wish they did not feel, that sin\nremaining in us is attended with the most powerful stimulants. With what\nconfidence can they dare to reject that general calling for their whole\nlife-time, whereas the gift of continence is frequently bestowed for a\ncertain time, as opportunity requires? In such obstinacy let them not\nexpect God to assist them, but rather let them remember what is written:\n“Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”[1077] Now, it is tempting God,\nto strive against the nature which he has implanted in us, and to\ndespise the gifts which he presents, as though they were not at all\nsuitable for us. And they not only do this, but even marriage itself,\nwhich God has deemed it no degradation of his majesty to institute,\nwhich he has pronounced to be “honourable in all,” which our Lord Jesus\nChrist sanctified with his presence, which he deigned to dignify with\nhis first miracle, they are not ashamed to stigmatize as pollution, for\nthe mere purpose of extolling celibacy, however it may be spent, with\nthe most extravagant encomiums. As though they did not exhibit a\nstriking proof in their own lives, that celibacy is one thing, and that\nvirginity is another; and yet they have the consummate impudence to call\nsuch a life angelic. This is certainly doing a great injury to the\nangels of God, to whom they compare persons guilty of fornication,\nadultery, and other crimes far more atrocious and impure. And there is\nnot the least need of arguments, when they are clearly convicted by the\nfact itself. For it is very evident what dreadful punishments the Lord\ngenerally inflicts on such arrogance, self-confidence, and contempt of\nhis gifts. Modesty forbids me to animadvert on those things which are\nmore secret, of which too much is already known. That we are not at\nliberty to vow any thing which may hinder us from serving God in our\nvocation, is beyond all controversy; as if a father of a family should\nvow that he will desert his wife and children, to undertake some other\ncharge; or as if a person qualified to fill the office of magistrate, on\nbeing chosen to it, should vow that he would remain in a private\nstation. But the observation we have made, that our liberty ought not to\nbe despised, has some difficulty, which requires a further explication.\nNow, the meaning may be briefly explained in the following manner: As\nGod has constituted us lords of all things, and has placed them in\nsubjection to us, in order that we might use them all for our\naccommodation, we have no reason to hope that we should perform a\nservice acceptable to God, by making ourselves slaves to external\nthings, which ought to be subservient to our assistance. I say this,\nbecause some persons consider themselves entitled to the praise of\nhumility, if they entangle themselves with many observances, from which\nthe Lord, for the best of reasons, intended we should be exempt.\nTherefore, if we would escape this danger, let us always remember, that\nwe are never to depart from that economy which the Lord has instituted\nin the Christian Church.\nIV. I proceed now to the third consideration which I mentioned; that it\nis of great importance with what intention a vow is made, if we wish it\nto be approved by God. For as the Lord regards the heart, and not the\nexternal appearance, it happens that the same action, performed with\ndifferent designs, is sometimes acceptable to him, and sometimes highly\ndispleasing. If any one vow abstinence from wine, as if there were any\nholiness in such abstinence, he is chargeable with superstition; if this\nbe done for any other end which is not improper, no one can disapprove\nof it. Now, as far as I am able to judge, there are four ends to which\nour vows may be rightly directed. For the sake of further elucidation, I\nrefer two of them to the time past, and the other two to the future. To\nthe time past belong those vows by which we either testify our gratitude\nto God for benefits received, or, in order to deprecate his wrath,\ninflict punishment on ourselves for sins that we have committed. The\nformer may be called vows of thanksgiving; the latter, vows of\npenitence. Of the former we have an example in Jacob, who vowed to give\nto God the tenth of all he should acquire, if the Lord would bring him\nagain from his exile to his father’s house in peace.[1078] We have other\nexamples of the same kind in the ancient peace-offerings, which used to\nbe vowed by pious kings and generals, entering on just wars, to be\noffered in case they should obtain the victory; or by persons labouring\nunder more than common difficulty, in case the Lord would deliver them.\nThus we are to understand all those places in the Psalms which speak of\nvows.[1079] Vows of this kind may also be now used among us, whenever\nGod delivers us from any great calamity, from a severe disease, or from\nany other danger. For on such occasions, it is not inconsistent with the\nduty of a pious man to consecrate to God some oblation that he has\nvowed, merely as a solemn token of grateful acknowledgment, that he may\nnot appear unthankful for his goodness. The nature of the second species\nof vows will sufficiently appear from only one familiar example. If a\nperson has fallen into any crime through the vice of intemperance,\nnothing prevents him from correcting that vice by a temporary\nrenunciation of all delicacies, and enforcing this abstinence by a vow,\nto lay himself under the stronger obligation. Yet I impose no perpetual\nlaw on those who have been guilty of such an offence; I only point out\nwhat they are at liberty to do, if they think that such a vow would be\nuseful to them. I consider a vow of this kind, therefore, as lawful,\nbut, at the same time, as left to the free choice of every individual.\nV. Vows which regard the future, as I have observed, have for their\nobject, partly to render us more cautious of danger, partly to stimulate\nus to the performance of duty. For example; a person perceives himself\nto be so prone to a certain vice, that, in something not otherwise evil,\nhe cannot restrain himself from falling into sin; he will commit no\nabsurdity, if he should deny himself the use of that thing for a season\nby a vow. If any one be convinced that this or the other ornament of\ndress is dangerous to him, and yet feel excessive desire for it, he\ncannot do better than restrain himself by imposing a necessity of\nabstinence, in order to free himself from all hesitation. So, if any one\nbe forgetful or negligent of the necessary duties of piety, why may he\nnot arouse his memory, and shake off his negligence by the imposition of\na vow? In both cases, I confess, there is an appearance of pupilage;\nbut, considered as helps of infirmity, such vows may be used with\nadvantage by the inexperienced and imperfect. Vows, therefore, which\nrespect one of these ends, especially those relating to external things,\nwe shall affirm to be lawful, if they be supported by the approbation of\nGod, if they be suitable to our calling, and if they be limited by the\nability of grace which God has given us.\nVI. It will not now be difficult to conclude what ideas ought to be\nentertained of vows universally. There is one vow common to all\nbelievers, which is made in baptism, and confirmed and established by us\nin the profession of our faith in the Catechism, and in the reception of\nthe Lord’s supper. For the sacraments resemble covenants, or instruments\nof agreement, by which God conveys his mercy to us, and in it eternal\nlife; and we, on the other hand, promise him obedience. Now, the form,\nor at least the sum of the vow is, that, renouncing Satan, we devote\nourselves to the service of God, to obey his holy commands, and not to\nfollow the corrupt inclinations of the flesh. This vow being sanctioned\nby the Scripture, and even required of all the children of God, it ought\nnot to be doubted that it is holy and useful. It is no objection to\nthis, that no man in the present life performs the perfect obedience\nwhich God requires of us; for as this stipulation is included in the\ncovenant of grace, which contains both remission of sins and the spirit\nof sanctification, the promise which we then make is connected with, and\npresupposes our supplication for mercy, and our solicitation for\nassistance. In judging of particular vows, it is necessary to remember\nthe three rules which we have given, which will enable us to form a\ncorrect estimate of the nature of every vow. Yet I would not be thought\nto carry my recommendation, even of those vows which I maintain to be\nholy, so far as to wish their daily use. For though I venture to\ndetermine nothing respecting the number or time, yet, if any person\nwould follow my advice, he will make none but such as are sober, and of\nshort duration. For if any one often recur to the making of many vows,\nall religion will be injured by their frequency, and there will be great\ndanger of falling into superstition. If any one bind himself by a\nperpetual vow, he will not discharge it without great trouble and\ndifficulty; or, wearied by its long continuance, he will at length\nviolate it altogether.\nVII. Now, it is evident what great superstition has for some ages\nprevailed in the world on this subject. One person vowed that he would\ndrink no wine; as though abstinence from wine were a service in itself\nacceptable to God. Another obliged himself to fast; another to abstain\nfrom meat on certain days, which he had falsely imagined to possess some\npeculiar sanctity beyond others. There were some vows far more puerile,\nthough not made by children. For it was esteemed great wisdom to vow\npilgrimages to places of more than common holiness, and to perform the\njourney either on foot, or with the body half naked, that the merit\nmight be augmented by the fatigue. These, and similar vows, with an\nincredible rage for which the world has long been inflamed, examined\naccording to the rules which we have laid down, will not only be found\nto be vain and nugatory, but replete with manifest impiety. For whatever\nmay be the judgment of the flesh, God holds nothing in greater\nabomination than services of human invention. The following pernicious\nand execrable opinions are also entertained; hypocrites, when they have\nperformed these fooleries, suppose themselves to have attained a high\ndegree of righteousness; they place the whole substance of piety in\nexternal observances; and they despise all who discover less concern\nabout these things than themselves.\nVIII. To enumerate all the particular kinds of vows, would answer no\ngood purpose. But, because monastic vows are held in very high\nveneration, as they seemed to be sanctioned by the public authority of\nthe Church, it is proper to make a few brief remarks respecting them. In\nthe first place, that no one may defend monachism, as it exists in the\npresent day, under the pretence of ancient and long-continued\nprescription, it must be observed, that the mode of life in monasteries,\nin ancient times, was very different from what it is now. They were the\nretreats of those who wished to habituate themselves to the greatest\nausterity and patience; for the discipline attributed to the\nLacedæmonians, under the laws of Lycurgus, was equalled, and even\nconsiderably exceeded in rigour, by that which was then practised among\nthe monks. They slept on the ground without any beds or couches; they\ndrank nothing but water; their food consisted entirely of bread, herbs,\nand roots; their principal dainties were oil, pease, and beans. They\nabstained from all delicacy of victuals and ornaments of the body. These\nthings might be thought incredible, if they were not attested by persons\nwho saw and experienced them, Gregory of Nazianzum, Basil, and\nChrysostom. But it was by such probationary discipline that they\nprepared themselves for higher offices. For that the monastic colleges\nwere at that time the seminaries, from which the Church was furnished\nwith ministers, is sufficiently evident from the examples of those whom\nwe have mentioned, who were all educated in monasteries, and from that\nsituation were called to the episcopal office, as well as of many other\ngreat and excellent men of their age. And Augustine shows that the same\ncustom of supplying ministers for the Church from the monasteries\ncontinued in his time; for the monks of the Island of Capraria are\naddressed by him in the following manner: “We exhort you in the Lord,\nbrethren, that you keep your purpose, and persevere to the end; and\nthat, if at any time your mother the Church shall have need of your\nlabour, you neither undertake the charge with eager pride, nor refuse it\nwith flattering indolence; but that you obey God with gentleness of\nheart; not preferring your leisure to the necessities of the Church,\nwhom, if no good men had been disposed to assist in the production of\nher children, you cannot discover how you could yourselves have been\nborn.” He here speaks of the ministry, which is the means of the\nregeneration of believers. Again, in an epistle to Aurelius, he says:\n“It causes an occasion of falling to themselves, and a most injurious\nindignity to the ecclesiastical order, if the deserters of monasteries\nare chosen to clerical offices; while of those who remain in the\nmonastery, we are accustomed to promote to such offices only the best\nand most approved. Unless, perhaps, as the common people say, A bad\ndancer is a good musician, so it should be jocularly said of us, A bad\nmonk will be a good minister. It is too much to be lamented, if we\nstimulate monks to such ruinous pride, and think the clergy deserving of\nsuch heavy disgrace; whereas, sometimes even a good monk will hardly\nmake a good priest, if he has sufficient continence, and yet is\ndeficient in necessary learning.” From these passages it appears that\npious men were accustomed to prepare themselves, by monastic discipline,\nfor the government of the Church, that they might be the better\nqualified to undertake such an important office. Not that all monks\nattained this end; or even aimed at it; for they were in general\nilliterate men, but those who were qualified were selected.\nIX. But Augustine has given us a portraiture of the ancient monachism,\nprincipally in two places; in his treatise On the Manners of the\nCatholic Church, in which he defends the sanctity of that profession\nagainst the calumnies of the Manichæans; and in another book, On the\nLabour of Monks, in which he inveighs against some degenerate monks, who\nhad begun to corrupt that order. The different things which he states, I\nshall here collect in a brief summary, using, as far as possible, his\nown words. “Despising the allurements of this world, united in a common\nlife of the strictest chastity and holiness, they spend their time\ntogether, living in prayers, in readings, and in conferences, neither\ninflated with pride, nor turbulent with obstinacy, nor pale with envy.\nNo one possesses any thing of his own; no one is burdensome to another.\nBy the labour of their hands, they procure those things which are\nsufficient to support the body, without hindering the mind from devotion\nto God. Their work they deliver to those who are called Deans. These\nDeans dispose of every thing with great care, and render an account to\none, whom they call Father. Most holy in their manners, preëminent in\ndivine learning, and excelling in every virtue, these Fathers, without\nany pride, consult the welfare of those whom they call children,\ncommanding them with great authority, and obeyed by them with great\ncheerfulness. At the close of the day, while yet fasting, every one\ncomes forth from his cell, and they all assemble to hear the Father; and\neach of these Fathers is surrounded by at least three thousand men,” (he\nis speaking chiefly of Egypt and the East;) “there they take some bodily\nrefreshment, as much as is sufficient for life and health; every one\nrestraining his appetite that he may make but a sparing use even of the\nprovisions placed before him, which are in small quantities, and of the\nplainest description. That they not only abstain from animal food and\nfrom wine, in order to repress libidinous desires, but from such things\nas stimulate the appetite with greater power, in proportion to the\nopinion entertained by some persons of their purity; under which\npretence a vile longing after exquisite meats, with the exception of\nanimal food, is wont to be ridiculously and shamefully defended.\nWhatever remains beyond their necessary food, (and the surplus is\nconsiderable, both from the diligence of their hands, and from the\nabstemiousness of their meals,) is distributed to the poor, with greater\ncare than if it had been earned by those who distribute it. For they are\nnot anxious to have an abundance of these things, but all their concern\nis, that none of their abundance may remain with them.” Afterwards,\nhaving mentioned their austerity, of which he had seen examples at Milan\nand other places, he says, “In these circumstances, no one is urged to\nausterities which he is unable to bear; there is no imposition on any\none, of that which he refuses; nor is he condemned by the rest, because\nhe confesses himself too weak to imitate them; for they remember the\nhigh commendations given of charity; they remember that to the pure, all\nthings are pure.[1080] Therefore all their industry is exerted, not in\nrejecting certain kinds of food as polluted, but in subduing\nconcupiscence and preserving the love of the brethren. They remember\nthat it is said, Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God\nshall destroy both it and them.[1081] Yet many strong persons abstain on\naccount of the weak. Many have a different reason for doing it; they are\nfond of living on meaner and less sumptuous food. These persons,\ntherefore, who are abstemious when in perfect health, if a state of\nindisposition requires, partake, without any fear, when they are sick.\nMany drink no wine; but this is not from an apprehension of being\ndefiled with it; for they most humanely cause it to be given to those\nwho are languid, and cannot obtain health of body without it; and some,\nwho foolishly refuse it, they admonish, with brotherly affection, to\nbeware lest their vain superstition debilitate them rather than promote\ntheir holiness. Thus they diligently exercise themselves in piety: but\nthey know that the exercise of the body extends only to a short time.\nCharity is principally observed; to charity the food, the conversation,\nthe apparel, the countenance, are subservient. They all assemble and\ncombine into one charity; to violate this, is accounted unlawful, and a\nsin against God; if any one resist charity, he is expelled and shunned;\nif any one offend against it, he is not suffered to remain a single\nday.” As Augustine appears, in these passages, to have exhibited a\nportraiture of the true character of ancient monachism, I have thought\nproper, notwithstanding their length, to insert them here; for I saw\nthat, however I might study brevity, yet I should go into still greater\nlength, if I were to collect the same things from different authors.\nX. My design here is not to pursue the whole argument, but merely to\npoint out, by the way, the characters of the monks who belonged to the\nancient Church, and the nature of the monastic profession at that\nperiod, that the judicious readers may be able, from a comparison, to\njudge of the effrontery of those who plead antiquity in support of the\nmonachism of the present day. When Augustine gives us a description of\nholy and legitimate monachism, he excludes from it all rigid exaction or\nimposition of those things which the Lord in his word has left free. But\nthere is nothing at the present day more severely enforced. For they\nconsider it a crime, never to be expiated, for any one to deviate in the\nminutest particular from the rules prescribed in the colour or shape of\ntheir apparel, the kind of food, or other frivolous and uninteresting\nceremonies. Augustine strenuously contends, that it is not lawful for\nmonks to live in idleness at the expense of others. He denies that there\nwas such an example to be found in his time in any well regulated\nmonastery. The present monks place the principal part of their sanctity\nin idleness. For if they were divested of idleness, what would become of\nthat contemplative life, in which they boast of excelling other men, and\nof making near approaches to the life of angels? In fine, Augustine\nrequires a monachism which would be no other than an exercise and\nassistance in the duties of piety, which are enjoined on all Christians.\nWhat! when he represents charity as the principal and almost only rule\nof it, can we suppose him to be commending a conspiracy, by which a few\nmen are closely united to each other, and separated from the whole body\nof the Church? On the contrary, he would have them to enlighten others\nby their example, in order to the preservation of the unity of the\nChurch. In both these respects, the nature of modern monachism is so\ndifferent, that it is scarcely possible to find any thing more\ndissimilar or opposite. For, not content with that piety, to the study\nof which Jesus Christ commands his servants constantly to devote\nthemselves, our present monks imagine I know not what new kind of piety,\nin the meditation of which they are become more perfect than all others.\nXI. If they deny this, I would wish them to inform me why they dignify\ntheir order alone with the title of _perfection_, and deny this\ncharacter to all the callings appointed by God. I am not unacquainted\nwith their sophistical solution, that it is so called, not as containing\nperfection in it, but because it is the best calculated of all callings\nfor the attainment of perfection. When they wish to elevate themselves\nin the estimation of the people, to entrap inexperienced and ignorant\nyouths, to assert their privileges, to extol their own dignity to the\ndegradation of others, they boast of being in a state of perfection.\nWhen they are so closely pressed, that they cannot defend such empty\narrogance, they have recourse to this subterfuge—that they have not yet\nattained perfection, but that they are in a condition more favourable\nthan any others for aspiring towards it. In the mean time they retain\nthe admiration of the people, as though the monastic life, and that\nalone, were angelic, perfect, and purified from every blemish. Under\nthis pretext they carry on a most lucrative traffic; but their\nmoderation lies buried in a few books. Who does not see that this is an\nintolerable mockery? But let us argue the case as if they really\nattributed no higher honour to their profession, than to call it a state\nadapted to the attainment of perfection. Still, by giving it this\ndesignation, they distinguish it, as by a peculiar mark, from all other\nmodes of life. And who can bear that such honour should be transferred\nto an institution, which has never received from God even a single\nsyllable of approbation, and that such indignity should be cast on all\nthe other callings of God, which have not only been enjoined, but\nadorned with signal commendations by his most holy word? And what an\noutrageous insult is offered to God, when a mere human invention is\npreferred beyond all the kinds of life which he has appointed and\ncelebrated by his own testimony!\nXII. Now, let them charge me with a calumny in what I have already\nalleged, that they are not content with the rule which God has\nprescribed to his servants. Though I were silent on the subject, they\nfurnish more than sufficient ground for their own accusation; for they\nopenly teach that they take upon themselves a greater burden than Christ\nlaid upon his disciples, because they promise to keep the evangelical\ncounsels, which inculcate the love of our enemies, and prohibit the\ndesire of revenge and profane swearing, and which, they say, are not\nbinding on Christians at large. What antiquity will they plead here?\nThis notion never entered into the mind of one of the ancients. They\nall, with one consent, declare that there was not a syllable uttered by\nChrist which we are not bound to obey; and without any hesitation they\nuniformly and expressly represent the passages in question as commands,\nwhich these sagacious interpreters pretend to have been delivered by\nChrist merely as counsels. But as we have already shown that this is a\nmost pestilent error, it may suffice to have briefly remarked here, that\nthe monachism which exists at present, is founded on the opinion, which\njustly deserves to be execrated by all believers, that some rule of life\nmay be imagined more perfect than the common one given by God to all the\nChurch. Whatever superstructure is raised on this foundation, cannot but\nbe abominable.\nXIII. But they adduce another argument in proof of their perfection,\nwhich they consider as most conclusive; our Lord said to the young man\nwho inquired what was the perfection of righteousness, “If thou wilt\nbe perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor.”[1082]\nWhether they do this, I shall not now dispute; let us at present put\nthe case that they do. They boast, therefore, that they have been made\nperfect by forsaking all that they have. If the whole of perfection\nconsist in this, what does Paul mean, when he says, “Though I bestow\nall my goods to feed the poor, and have not charity, I am\nnothing?”[1083] What kind of perfection is that which is reduced to\nnothing by the absence of charity? Here they will be obliged to\nanswer, that though this is the principal, yet it is not the only work\nof perfection. But here also they are contradicted by Paul, who\nhesitates not to make “charity,” without any such renunciation, “the\nbond of perfection.”[1084] If it is certain, that there is no\ndiscordance between the Master and the disciple,—and Paul explicitly\ndenies the perfection of a man to consist in the renunciation of his\nproperty, and, on the other hand, asserts that it may exist without\nthat relinquishment,—it is necessary to examine in what sense we are\nto understand the declaration of Christ, “If thou wilt be perfect, go\nand sell that thou hast.” Now, there will be no obscurity in the\nsense, if we consider, what ought always to be considered in all the\ndiscourses of Christ, to whom the words are addressed. A young man\ninquires, “What good thing shall I do, that I may inherit eternal\nlife?”[1085] As the question related to works, Christ refers him to\nthe law; and that justly; for, considered in itself, it is the way of\neternal life, and is not otherwise insufficient to conduct us to\nsalvation, than in consequence of our depravity. By this answer Christ\ndeclared, that he taught no other system of life than that which had\nanciently been delivered in the law of God. Thus he at the same time\ngave a testimony to the divine law as the doctrine of perfect\nrighteousness, and precluded all calumnies, that he might not appear,\nby inculcating a new rule of life, to incite the people to a departure\nfrom the law. The young man, not indeed from badness of heart, but\ninfected with vain confidence, replies respecting the precepts of the\nlaw, “All these things have I kept from my youth up.”[1086] It is\ncertain beyond all doubt, that he was at an immense distance from that\nwhich he boasted of having attained; and had his boast been true, he\nwould have wanted nothing necessary to complete perfection. For it has\nbeen already proved that the law contains in itself a perfect\nrighteousness; and it appears from this passage that the observance of\nit is called _the entrance_ into eternal life. To teach him how little\nproficiency he had made in that righteousness, which he too\nconfidently replied that he had fulfilled, it was necessary to\ninvestigate and expose a vice which lay concealed in his heart. He\nabounded in riches, and his heart was fixed on them. Because he was\nnot sensible of this secret wound, therefore, Christ probes it. “Go,”\nsays he, “sell all that thou hast.” If he had been so good an observer\nof the law as he imagined, he would not have gone away sorrowful on\nhearing this answer. For he who loves God with all his heart, not only\nesteems as worthless whatever is inconsistent with his love, but also\nabominates it as pernicious. Therefore, when Christ commands a rich\nand avaricious man to relinquish all his wealth, it is just the same\nas if he commanded an ambitious man to renounce all his honours, a\nvoluptuous man to abandon all his delicacies, and an unchaste man to\nforsake all the instruments of temptation. Thus consciences, which\nreceive no impression from general admonitions, require to be recalled\nto a particular sense of their own guilt. It is in vain, therefore, to\nextend this particular argument to a general maxim, as though Christ\nplaced all the perfection of man in the renunciation of his\npossessions, whereas he only meant by this direction to drive this\nyoung man, who betrayed such excessive self-complacency, into a sense\nof his malady, that he might perceive himself to be still very far\nfrom the perfect obedience of the law, to which he arrogantly and\nfalsely pretended. I confess that this passage was misunderstood by\nsome of the fathers, and that their misconstruction gave rise to an\naffectation of voluntary poverty; so that they were supposed to be the\nonly happy persons, who renounced all earthly things, and devoted\nthemselves entirely to Christ. But I trust that the explication which\nI have given will be satisfactory to all good and peaceable persons,\nso as to leave them in no doubt of the true meaning of Christ.\nXIV. Nothing, however, was further from the intention of the fathers,\nthan to establish such a perfection as has since been fabricated by\nthese hooded sophisters, which goes to set up two kinds of Christianity.\nFor no one had then given birth to that sacrilegious dogma, which\ncompares the monastic profession to baptism, and even openly asserts it\nto be a species of second baptism. Who can doubt that the fathers would\nhave sincerely abhorred such blasphemy? As to the concluding observation\nof Augustine, respecting the ancient monks, that they devoted themselves\nwholly to charity, what need is there for a word to be said to\ndemonstrate it to be altogether inapplicable to this modern profession?\nThe fact itself declares, that all who retire into monasteries separate\nthemselves from the Church. For do they not separate themselves from the\nlegitimate society of believers, by taking to themselves a peculiar\nministry and a private administration of the sacraments? What is a\ndisruption of the communion of the Church, if this be not? And to pursue\nthe comparison which I have commenced, and to conclude it at once, what\nresemblance have they in this respect to the monks of ancient times?\nThough they lived in a state of seclusion from other men, they had no\nseparate Church; they received the sacraments with others; they attended\nthe solemn assemblies to hear preaching, and to unite in prayers with\nthe company of believers; and there they formed a part of the people. In\nerecting a private altar for themselves, what have the present monks\ndone, but broken the bond of unity? For they have excommunicated\nthemselves from the general body of the Church, and have shown contempt\nof the ordinary ministry, by which it has pleased God that peace and\ncharity should be preserved among his servants. All the present\nmonasteries, therefore, I maintain to be so many conventicles of\nschismatics, who disturb the order of the Church, and have been cut off\nfrom the legitimate society of believers. And to place this division\nbeyond all doubt, they have assumed various names of sects; and have not\nbeen ashamed to glory in that which Paul execrates beyond all\npossibility of exaggeration. Unless we suppose that Christ was divided\nby the Corinthians, when every one boasted of his particular\nteacher;[1087] and that it is now no derogation from the honour of\nChrist, when, instead of the name of Christians, some are called\nBenedictines, others Franciscans, others Dominicans; and when they\nhaughtily assume these titles to themselves as the badges of their\nreligious profession, from an affectation of being distinguished from\nthe general body of Christians.\nXV. The differences which I have stated, between the ancient monks and\nthose of the present age, relate not to manners, but to the profession\nitself. Let it, therefore, be remembered by the readers, that I have\nspoken of monachism rather than of monks, and have censured those faults\nwhich are not merely chargeable on the lives of a few, but which are\ninseparable from the life itself. The great dissimilarity of their\nmanners can hardly require a particular representation. It is obvious,\nthat there is no order of men more polluted with all the turpitude of\nvice; none more disgraced by factions, animosities, cabals, and\nintrigues. In some few convents, indeed, they live in chastity; if\nchastity it must be called, where concupiscence is so far restrained as\nnot to be publicly infamous; but it is scarcely possible to find one\nconvent in ten, which is not rather a brothel than a sanctuary of\nchastity. What frugality is there in their food? They are exactly like\nso many swine fattening in a sty. But lest they should complain that I\nhandle them too roughly, I proceed no further; though in the few\nparticulars upon which I have touched, whoever knows the matter of fact\nwill acknowledge that I have confined myself to the simple truth.\nAugustine, at a time when, according to his own testimony, monks were so\neminent for the strictest chastity, yet complains that there were many\nvagabonds among them, who, by wicked arts and impostures, extorted money\nfrom the unwary, who exercised a scandalous traffic by carrying about\nthe relics of martyrs, and even sold the bones of any dead men as the\nbones of martyrs, and who brought disgrace on the order by a great\nnumber of similar crimes. As he declares that he had seen no better men\nthan those who had been improved in monasteries, so he complains that he\nhad seen no worse men than those who had been corrupted in monasteries.\nWhat would he say, at the present day, to see almost all monasteries,\nnot only filled, but overflowing, with so many and such desperate vices?\nI say nothing but what is notorious to every person; though this censure\nis not applicable to all without any exception. For as the rule and\ndiscipline of holy living has never been so well established in\nmonasteries, but that there were always some drones very different from\nthe rest, so I do not say that the monks of the present day have so far\ndegenerated from that holy antiquity, that there are not still some good\nmen among their body; but they are few, dispersed and concealed among a\nvast multitude of the wicked and abandoned; and they are not only held\nin contempt, but insulted and molested, and sometimes even treated with\ncruelty by the rest; who, according to a proverb of the Milesians, think\nthat no good man ought to be suffered to remain among them.\nXVI. By this comparison of ancient and modern monachism I trust I have\nsucceeded in my design of evincing the fallacy of the plea, which the\npresent men of the hood allege in defence of their profession, from the\nexample of the primitive Church; as they differ from the early monks\njust as apes do from men. At the same time, I admit that even in the\nancient system which Augustine commends, there is something which I\ncannot altogether approve. I grant, they discovered no superstition in\nthe external exercises of a too rigid discipline; but I maintain that\nthey were not free from excessive affectation and misguided zeal. It\nseemed a good thing to forsake their property in order to exempt\nthemselves from all earthly solicitude; but God sets a higher value on\npious exertions for the government of a family, when a holy father of a\nfamily, free from all avarice, ambition, and other corrupt passions,\ndevotes himself to this object, that he may serve God in a particular\ncalling. It is a beautiful thing to live the life of a philosopher in\nretirement, at a distance from the society of men; but it is not the\npart of Christian charity for a man to act as if he hated all mankind,\nwithdrawing to the solitude of a desert, and abandoning the principal\nduties which the Lord has commanded. Though we should grant that there\nwas no other evil in this profession, yet certainly this was not a small\none, that it introduced a useless and pernicious example into the\nChurch.\nXVII. Let us now examine the nature of the vows by which monks in the\npresent day are initiated into this celebrated order. In the first\nplace, their design is to institute a new service, in order to merit the\nfavour of God; therefore I conclude, from the principles already\nestablished, that whatever they vow is an abomination in the sight of\nGod. Secondly, without any regard to the calling of God, and without any\napprobation from him, they invent for themselves a new mode of life, in\nconformity with their own inclinations; therefore I maintain it to be a\nrash and unlawful attempt, because their consciences have nothing to\nrest upon before God, and “whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.”[1088]\nThirdly, they bind themselves to many corrupt and impious services,\ncomprehended in the monachism of the present day; therefore I contend,\nthat they are not consecrated to God, but to the devil. For why was it\nlawful for the prophet to say of the Israelites, that “they sacrificed\nunto devils, not to God,”[1089] only because they had corrupted the true\nworship of God with profane ceremonies; and why shall it not be lawful\nfor us to say the same of the monks, whose assumption of the hood is\naccompanied with the yoke of a thousand impious superstitions? Now, what\nis the nature of their vows? They promise to God to maintain perpetual\nvirginity, as if they had previously stipulated with him that he should\nexempt them from the necessity of marriage. They have no room to plead,\nthat they make this vow merely in a reliance on the grace of God; for as\nhe declares that it is not given to all men,[1090] we have no right to\nentertain a confidence that we shall receive the special gift. Let those\nwho possess it use it: if they experience disquietude from the\nstimulations of passion, let them have recourse to his aid by whom alone\nthey can be strengthened to resist. If they are unsuccessful, let them\nnot despise the remedy which is offered to them. For those who are\ndenied the gift of continence, are undoubtedly called to marriage by the\nvoice of God. By continence I mean, not a mere abstinence of the body\nfrom fornication, but an unpolluted chastity of mind. For Paul enjoins\nthe avoidance not only of external impurity, but also of the internal\nburning of libidinous desire.[1091] It has been a custom, they say, from\ntime immemorial, for persons who intended to devote themselves entirely\nto the Lord, to bind themselves by a vow of continence. I confess that\nthis custom was practised in the early ages; but I cannot admit those\nages to have been so free from every fault, that whatever was done then\nmust be received as a rule. And it was only by degrees that in process\nof time things were carried to such an extreme of rigour that no one,\nafter having made the vow, was permitted to recall it. This is evident\nfrom Cyprian. “If virgins have faithfully dedicated themselves to God,\nlet them persevere in modesty and chastity without any disguise. Thus,\nbeing firm and constant, they may expect the reward of virginity. But if\nthey will not, or cannot persevere, it is better for them to be married,\nthan with their pleasure to fall into the fire.” With what reproaches\nwould they now hesitate to stigmatize a person who would wish to\nintroduce such a reasonable limitation of the vow of continence? They\nhave widely departed, therefore, from the ancient custom, in refusing to\nadmit the least moderation or relaxation, if any one be found incapable\nof performing the vow; and not only so, but they are not ashamed to\npronounce that he commits a greater sin, if he remedies his intemperance\nby taking a wife, than if he contaminates his body and soul with\nfornication.\nXVIII. But they still pursue the argument, and endeavour to show that\nvows of this kind were in use in the times of the apostles; because Paul\nsays that widows who, after having been received into the public service\nof the church, married, had “cast off their first faith.”[1092] I do not\ndeny that widows who dedicated themselves and their services to the\nChurch, thereby entered into a tacit obligation never to marry again;\nnot because they placed any religion in such abstinence, as began to be\nthe case afterwards; but because they could not discharge that office\nwithout being at their own disposal, free from the restraint of\nmarriage. But if, after having pledged their faith, they contemplated a\nsecond marriage, what was this but renouncing the calling of God? It is\nno wonder, therefore, if he says that with such desires “they wax wanton\nagainst Christ.” Afterwards, by way of amplification, he subjoins, that\nthey failed of performing what they had promised to the Church, so that\nthey even violated and annulled their first faith pledged in baptism;\nwhich includes an engagement from every one to fulfil the duties of his\ncalling. Unless it be thought better to understand the meaning to be,\nthat having, as it were, lost all shame, they would thenceforward have\nno longer any regard for virtue, but would abandon themselves to every\nkind of profligacy, and in a licentious and dissolute life exhibit the\ngreatest contrariety to the character of Christian women—an\ninterpretation which I much approve. We reply, therefore, that those\nwidows, who were then received into the service of the Church, imposed\non themselves the condition of perpetual widowhood; if they afterwards\nmarried, we easily understand their situation to have been as Paul\nstates, that, casting off shame, they betrayed an insolence unbecoming\nChristian women; and that thus they not only sinned in breaking their\nfaith pledged to the Church, but in departing from the common\nobligations of pious females. But first, I deny that they engaged to\nremain in a state of widowhood for any other reason than because\nmarriage would be altogether incompatible with the office which they\nundertook; or that they bound themselves to widowhood at all, except as\nfar as the necessity of their vocation should require. Secondly, I do\nnot admit that their profession was so binding, but that even then it\nwas better for them to marry than to be inflamed with concupiscence, or\nto be guilty of any impurity of conduct. Thirdly, I observe that Paul\nprescribes that age which is generally beyond all danger, forbidding any\nto be received under threescore years old; and especially when he\ndirects that the choice shall be limited to those who have been content\nwith one marriage, and have thus already given proof of their\ncontinence. And we condemn the vow of celibacy for no other reason, but\nbecause it is unjustly considered as a service acceptable to God, and is\nrashly made by those who have not the power to keep it.\nXIX. But how was it possible to apply this passage of Paul to nuns? For\nwidows were appointed deaconesses, not to charm God by songs or\nunintelligible murmurs, and to spend the rest of their time in idleness;\nbut to serve the poor on behalf of the whole Church, and to employ\nthemselves with all attention, earnestness, and diligence, in the duties\nof charity. They made a vow of widowhood, not with a view of performing\nany service to God in abstaining from marriage, but merely that they\nmight be more at liberty for the discharge of their office. Lastly, they\nmade this vow, not in their youth, nor in the flower of their age, to\nlearn afterwards, by late experience, over what a precipice they had\nthrown themselves; but, when they appeared to have passed all danger,\nthey made a vow equally consistent with safety and with piety. But, not\nto urge the two former considerations, it is sufficient to observe, that\nit was not allowable for women to be admitted to make vows of continence\nbefore the age of sixty years; since the apostle says, “Let not a widow\nbe taken into the number under threescore years old.” “I will that the\nyounger women marry and bear children.”[1093] The subsequent admission\nof this vow at the age of forty-eight years, then forty years, and then\nthirty, can by no means be excused; and it is still more intolerable\nthat unhappy girls, before they are old enough to be capable of knowing\nor having any experience of themselves, should be inveigled by fraud and\ncompelled by threats to entangle themselves in those execrable snares. I\nshall not stay to oppose the other two vows, made by monks and nuns, of\npoverty and obedience. I will only observe, that beside the many\nsuperstitions with which, under existing circumstances, they are\ninterwoven, they appear to be framed for the purpose of mocking both God\nand men. But that we may not seem too severe in agitating every\nparticular point, we shall content ourselves with the general repetition\nalready given.\nXX. The nature of those vows which are legitimate and acceptable to God,\nI think, has been sufficiently declared. Yet as timid and inexperienced\nconsciences, even after they are dissatisfied with a vow, and convinced\nof its impropriety, nevertheless feel doubts respecting the obligation,\nand are grievously distressed, on the one hand, from a dread of\nviolating their promise to God, and, on the other, from a fear of\nincurring greater guilt by observing it, it is necessary here to offer\nthem some assistance to enable them to extricate themselves from this\ndifficulty. Now, to remove every scruple at once, I remark, that all\nvows, not legitimate or rightly made, as they are of no value with God,\nso they ought to have no force with us. For if in human contracts no\npromises are obligatory upon us, but those to which the party with whom\nwe contract wishes to bind us, it is absurd to consider ourselves\nconstrained to the performance of those things which God never requires\nof us; especially as our works cannot be good unless they please God,\nand are accompanied with the testimony of our conscience that he accepts\nthem. For this remains a fixed principle, that “whatsoever is not of\nfaith, is sin;”[1094] by which Paul intends, that whatever work is\nundertaken with doubts, is consequently sinful, because all good works\nspring from faith, by which we are assured of their acceptance with God.\nTherefore, if it be not lawful for a Christian man to attempt any thing\nwithout this assurance, and if any one through ignorance has made a rash\nvow, and afterwards discovered his error, why should he not desist from\nthe performance of it? since vows inconsiderately made, not only are not\nbinding, but ought of necessity to be cancelled; and, also, as they are\nnot only of no value in the sight of God, but are an abomination to him,\nas we have already demonstrated. It is useless to argue any longer on a\nsubject which does not require it. This one argument appears to me\nsufficient to tranquillize pious consciences, and to liberate them from\nevery scruple—That all works not proceeding from a pure source, and\ndirected to a legitimate end, are rejected by God, and rejected in such\na manner that he forbids our continuance, as much as our commencement,\nof them. Hence we may conclude, that vows which have originated in error\nand superstition, are of no value with God, and ought to be relinquished\nby us.\nXXI. This solution will furnish an answer to the calumnies of the\nwicked, in defence of those who leave monachism for some honourable way\nof life. They are heavily accused of breach of faith and perjury; having\nbroken, as it is commonly supposed, the indissoluble bond which held\nthem to God and the Church. But I maintain that there is no bond, where\nthat which man confirms is abrogated by God. Besides, though we should\ngrant that they were bound while they were involved in error and\nignorance of God,—now, since they have been enlightened with the\nknowledge of the truth, I maintain that the grace of Christ has\ndelivered them from the obligation. For if the cross of Christ possesses\nsuch efficacy as to deliver us from the curse, under which we were held\nby the law of God, how much more, then, shall it extricate us from other\nbonds, which are nothing but delusive snares of Satan! Whomsoever,\ntherefore, Christ illuminates with the light of his gospel, there is no\ndoubt that he liberates them from all the snares in which they had\nentangled themselves by superstition. Though they are not at a loss for\nanother defence, if they are not qualified to live in celibacy. For if\nan impossible vow be the ruin of souls, which it is the will of the Lord\nto save and not to destroy,—it follows that it is not right to persevere\nin it. But the impossibility of an observance of the vow of continence\nby those who are not endued with a special gift, we have already shown,\nand without my saying a word, experience itself declares; for it is\nnotorious what extreme impurity prevails in almost all monasteries; and\nif any of them appear more virtuous and modest than the rest, it does\nnot follow that they are really more chaste, because they conceal the\nvice of unchastity. Thus God inflicts awful punishments on the audacity\nof men, when, forgetting their weakness, they covet, in opposition to\nnature, that which is denied them, and, despising the remedies which God\nhad put into their hands, indulge a contumacious and obstinate\npresumption that they are able to overcome the vice of incontinence. For\nwhat shall we call it but contumacy, when any one who is admonished that\nhe stands in need of marriage, and that it has been given to him by the\nLord as a remedy, not only contemns it, but binds himself by an oath to\npersevere in that contempt?\nFootnote 1072:\nRom. xiv. 23.\nFootnote 1073:\nRom. xii. 3. 1 Cor. xii. 11.\nFootnote 1074:\nActs xxiii. 12.\nFootnote 1075:\nJudges xi. 30-40.\nFootnote 1076:\nGen. ii. 18.\nFootnote 1077:\nDeut. vi. 16.

          "content": "THE SACRAMENTS.\nConnected with the preaching of the gospel, another assistance and\nsupport for our faith is presented to us in the sacraments; on the\nsubject of which it is highly important to lay down some certain\ndoctrine, that we may learn for what end they were instituted, and how\nthey ought to be used. In the first place, it is necessary to consider\nwhat a sacrament is. Now, I think it will be a simple and appropriate\ndefinition, if we say that it is an outward sign, by which the Lord\nseals in our consciences the promises of his good-will towards us, to\nsupport the weakness of our faith; and we on our part testify our piety\ntowards him, in his presence and that of angels, as well as before men.\nIt may, however, be more briefly defined, in other words, by calling it\na testimony of the grace of God towards us, confirmed by an outward\nsign, with a reciprocal attestation of our piety towards him. Whichever\nof these definitions be chosen, it conveys exactly the same meaning as\nthat of Augustine, which states a sacrament to be “a visible sign of a\nsacred thing,” or “a visible form of invisible grace;” but it expresses\nthe thing itself with more clearness and precision; for as his\nconciseness leaves some obscurity, by which many inexperienced persons\nmay be misled, I have endeavoured to render the subject plainer by more\nwords, that no room might be left for any doubt.\nII. The reason why the ancient fathers used this word in such a sense is\nvery evident. For whenever the author of the old common version of the\nNew Testament wanted to render the Greek word μυστηριον, _mystery_, into\nLatin, especially where it related to Divine things, he used the word\n_sacramentum_, “sacrament.” Thus, in the Epistle to the Ephesians,\n“Having made known unto us the _mystery_ of his will.”[1095] Again: “If\nye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me\nto you-ward; how that by revelation he made known unto me the\n_mystery_.”[1096] In the Epistle to the Colossians: “The _mystery_ which\nhath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest\nto his saints; to whom God would make known what is the riches of the\nglory of this _mystery_.”[1097] Again, to Timothy: “Great is the\n_mystery_ of godliness; God was manifest in the flesh.”[1098] In all\nthese places, where the word _mystery_ is used, the author of that\nversion has rendered it _sacrament_. He would not say _arcanum_, or\n_secret_, lest he should appear to degrade the majesty of the subject.\nTherefore he has used the word _sacrament_ for a sacred or Divine\nsecret. In this signification it frequently occurs in the writings of\nthe fathers. And it is well known, that baptism and the Lord’s supper,\nwhich the Latins denominate _sacraments_, are called _mysteries_ by the\nGreeks; a synonymous use of the terms, which removes every doubt. And\nhence the word _sacrament_ came to be applied to those signs which\ncontained a representation of sublime and spiritual things; which is\nalso remarked by Augustine, who says, “It would be tedious to dispute\nrespecting the diversity of signs, which, when they pertain to Divine\nthings, are called _sacraments_.”\nIII. Now, from the definition which we have established, we see that\nthere is never any sacrament without an antecedent promise of God, to\nwhich it is subjoined as an appendix, in order to confirm and seal the\npromise itself, and to certify and ratify it to us; which means God\nforesees to be necessary, in the first place on account of our ignorance\nand dulness, and in the next place on account of our weakness; and yet,\nstrictly speaking, not so much for the confirmation of his sacred word,\nas for our establishment in the faith of it. For the truth of God is\nsufficiently solid and certain in itself, and can receive no better\nconfirmation from any other quarter than from itself; but our faith\nbeing slender and weak, unless it be supported on every side, and\nsustained by every assistance, immediately shakes, fluctuates, totters,\nand falls. And as we are corporeal, always creeping on the ground,\ncleaving to terrestrial and carnal objects, and incapable of\nunderstanding or conceiving of any thing of a spiritual nature, our\nmerciful Lord, in his infinite indulgence, accommodates himself to our\ncapacity, condescending to lead us to himself even by these earthly\nelements, and in the flesh itself to present to us a mirror of spiritual\nblessings. “For if we were incorporeal,” as Chrysostom says, “he would\nhave given us these things pure and incorporeal. Now because we have\nsouls enclosed in bodies, he gives us spiritual things under visible\nemblems; not because there are such qualities in the nature of the\nthings presented to us in the sacraments, but because they have been\ndesignated by God to this signification.”\nIV. This is what is commonly said, that a sacrament consists of the word\nand the outward sign. For we ought to understand the _word_, not of a\nmurmur uttered without any meaning or faith, a mere whisper like a\nmagical incantation, supposed to possess the power of consecrating the\nelements, but of the gospel preached, which instructs us in the\nsignification of the visible sign. That which is commonly practised\nunder the tyranny of the pope, therefore, involves a gross profanation\nof the mysteries; for they have thought it sufficient for the priest to\nmutter over the form of consecration, while the people are gazing in\nignorance. Indeed, they have taken effectual care that it should be all\nunintelligible to the people; for they have pronounced the consecration\nin Latin, before illiterate men; and have at length carried superstition\nto such a pitch, as to consider it not rightly performed, unless it be\ndone in a hoarse murmur, which few could hear. But Augustine speaks in a\nvery different manner of the sacramental word. “Let the word,” says he,\n“be added to the element, and it will become a sacrament. For whence\ndoes the water derive such great virtue, as at once to touch the body\nand purify the heart, except from the word? not because it is spoken,\nbut because it is believed. For in the word itself the transient sound\nis one thing, the permanent virtue is another. ‘This is the word of\nfaith which we preach,’[1099] says the apostle. Whence it is said of the\nGentiles, in the Acts of the Apostles, that ‘God purifies their hearts\nby faith.’[1100] And the apostle Peter says, ‘Baptism doth also now save\nus, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a\ngood conscience towards God.)’[1101] ‘This is the word of faith which we\npreach,’ by which baptism is consecrated to endue it with a purifying\nvirtue.” We see how he makes the preaching of the word necessary to the\nproduction of faith. And we need not labour much to prove this, because\nit is very plain what Christ did, what he commanded us to do, what the\napostles followed, and what the purer Church observed. Even from the\nbeginning of the world, whenever God gave the holy fathers any sign, it\nis well known to have been inseparably connected with some doctrine,\nwithout which our senses would only be astonished with the mere view of\nit. Therefore, when we hear mention made of the sacramental word, let us\nunderstand it of the promise, which, being audibly and intelligibly\npreached by the minister, instructs the people in the meaning and\ntendency of the sign.\nV. Nor ought any attention to be paid to some, who endeavour to oppose\nthis by a dilemma which discovers more subtlety than solidity. They say,\nEither we know that the word of God which precedes the sacrament is the\ntrue will of God, or we do not know it. If we know it, then we learn\nnothing new from the sacrament which follows. If we do not know it,\nneither shall we learn it from the sacrament, the virtue of which lies\nentirely in the word. Let it be concisely replied, that the seals\nappended to charters, patents, and other public instruments, are\nnothing, taken by themselves; because they would be appended to no\npurpose, if the parchment had nothing written upon it; and yet they\nnevertheless confirm and authenticate what is written on the instruments\nto which they are annexed. Nor can it be objected that this similitude\nhas been recently invented by us; for it has been used by Paul himself,\nwho calls circumcision a _seal_,[1102] σφραγιδα, in a passage where he\nis professedly contending that circumcision did not constitute the\nrighteousness of Abraham, but was a seal of that covenant, in the faith\nof which he had already been justified. And what is there that ought to\ngive any man much offence, if we teach that the promise is sealed by the\nsacraments, while it is evident that among the promises themselves one\nis confirmed by another? For in proportion to its superior clearness, it\nis the better calculated for the support of faith. Now, the sacraments\nbring us the clearest promises, and have this peculiarity beyond the\nword, that they give us a lively representation of them, as in a\npicture. Nor ought we to regard the objection, frequently urged, from\nthe distinction between sacraments and seals of civil instruments, that\nwhile they both consist of the carnal elements of this world, the former\ncannot be fit to seal the promises of God, which are spiritual and\neternal, as the latter are accustomed to be appended to seal the edicts\nof princes relative to frail and transitory things. For the believer,\nwhen the sacraments are placed before his eyes, does not confine himself\nto that carnal spectacle; but by those steps of analogy which I have\nindicated, rises in pious contemplation to the sublime mysteries which\nare concealed under the sacramental symbols.\nVI. And since the Lord calls his promises _covenants_, and the\nsacraments _seals of covenants_, we may draw a similitude from the\ncovenants of men. The ancients, in confirmation of their engagements,\nwere accustomed to kill a sow. But what would have been the slaughter of\na sow, if it had not been accompanied, and even preceded, by some words?\nFor sows were often slaughtered without any latent or sublime mystery.\nWhat is the contact of one man’s right hand with that of another, since\nhands are not unfrequently joined in hostility? But when words of\nfriendship and compact have preceded, the obligations of covenants are\nconfirmed by such signs, notwithstanding they have been previously\nconceived, proposed, and determined in words. Sacraments, therefore, are\nexercises, which increase and strengthen our faith in the word of God;\nand because we are corporeal, they are exhibited under corporeal\nsymbols, to instruct us according to our dull capacities, and to lead us\nby the hand as so many young children. For this reason Augustine calls a\nsacrament “a visible word;” because it represents the promises of God\nportrayed as in a picture, and places before our eyes an image of them,\nin which every lineament is strikingly expressed. Other similitudes may\nalso be adduced for the better elucidation of the nature of sacraments;\nas if we call them _pillars of our faith_; for as an edifice rests on\nits foundation, and yet, from the addition of pillars placed under it,\nreceives an increase of stability, so faith rests on the word of God as\nits foundation; but when the sacraments are added to it as pillars, they\nbring with them an accession of strength. Or if we call them _mirrors_,\nin which we may contemplate the riches of grace which God imparts to us;\nfor in the sacraments, as we have already observed, he manifests himself\nto us as far as our dulness is capable of knowing him, and testifies his\nbenevolence and love towards us more expressly than he does by his word.\nVII. Nor is there any force in their reasoning, when they contend that\nthe sacraments are not testimonies of the grace of God, because they are\noften administered to the wicked, who yet do not, in consequence of\nthis, experience God to be more propitious to them, but rather procure\nto themselves more grievous condemnation. For, by the same argument,\nneither would the gospel be a testimony of the grace of God, because it\nis heard by many who despise it, nor even Christ himself, who was seen\nand known by multitudes, of whom very few received him. A similar\nobservation may be applied to royal edicts; for great numbers of people\ndespise and deride that seal of authentication, notwithstanding they\nknow that it proceeded from the monarch to confirm his will; some\nutterly disregard it, as a thing not relating to them; others even hold\nit in execration; so that a survey of the correspondence of the two\ncases ought to produce greater approbation of the similitude which I\nhave before used. Therefore it is certain that the Lord offers us his\nmercy, and a pledge of his grace, both in his holy word and in the\nsacraments; but it is not apprehended except by those who receive the\nword and sacraments with a certain faith; as the Father has offered and\npresented Christ to all for salvation, but he is not known and received\nby all. Augustine, intending to express this sentiment, somewhere says,\nthat the efficacy of the word is displayed in the sacrament, “not\nbecause it is spoken, but because it is believed.” Therefore Paul, when\nhe is addressing believers, speaks of the sacraments so as to include in\nthem the communion of Christ; as when he says, “As many of you as have\nbeen baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.”[1103] Again: “By one\nSpirit are we all baptized into one body.”[1104] But when he speaks of\nthe improper use of the sacraments, he attributes no more to them than\nto vain and useless figures; by which he signifies that, however impious\npersons and hypocrites, by their perversion of the sacraments, may\ndestroy or obscure the effect of Divine grace in them, yet that,\nnotwithstanding this, whenever and wherever God pleases, they afford a\ntrue testimony of the communion of Christ, and the Spirit of God himself\nexhibits and performs the very thing which they promise. We conclude,\ntherefore, that sacraments are truly called testimonies of the grace of\nGod, and are, as it were, seals of the benevolence he bears to us,\nwhich, by confirming it to our minds, sustain, cherish, strengthen, and\nincrease our faith. The reasons which some are in the habit of objecting\nagainst this sentiment are exceedingly weak and frivolous. They allege,\nthat if our faith be good, it cannot be made better; for that there is\nno real faith except that which rests on the mercy of God, without any\nwavering, instability, or distraction. It would have been better for\nsuch persons to pray, with the apostles, that the Lord would increase\ntheir faith,[1105] than confidently to boast of such a perfection of\nfaith, as no one of the sons of men ever yet attained, or ever will\nattain, in this life. Let them answer what kind of faith they suppose\nhim to have possessed, who said, “Lord, I believe; help thou mine\nunbelief.”[1106] For even that, though yet only in its commencement, was\na good faith, and capable of being improved by the removal of unbelief.\nBut there is no argument which more fully refutes them than their own\nconscience; for if they confess themselves sinners, which, whatever they\nmay wish, they cannot deny, they must be obliged to impute it to the\nimperfection of their faith.\nVIII. But they say, Philip answered the eunuch, that he might be\nbaptized “if” he “believed with all” his “heart.”[1107] And what room,\nthey ask, is there here for the confirmation of baptism, where faith\nfills the whole heart? On the other hand, I ask them, whether they do\nnot feel a large part of their heart destitute of faith, and whether\nthey do not daily know some fresh increase of it. A heathen gloried that\nhe grew old in learning. We Christians are miserable indeed if we grow\nold in making no improvement, whose faith ought to be advancing from one\nstage to another till its attainment of perfect manhood. “To believe\nwith all the heart,” therefore, in this passage, is not to believe\nChrist in a perfect manner, but only signifies embracing him with\nsincerity of soul and firmness of mind; not to be filled with him, but\nto hunger, thirst, and sigh after him with ardent affection. It is the\ncustom of the Scriptures to say that any thing is done with the whole\nheart which is done with sincerity of mind, as in these and other\npassages: “With my whole heart have I sought thee;” “I will praise the\nLord with my whole heart.”[1108] On the contrary, when it rebukes the\nfraudulent and deceitful, it reproaches them with “a double\nheart.”[1109] Our adversaries further allege, that if faith be increased\nby the sacraments, the Holy Spirit must have been given in vain, whose\nwork and influence it is to commence, to confirm, and to consummate\nfaith. I confess that faith is the peculiar and entire work of the Holy\nSpirit, by whose illumination we know God and the treasures of his\ngoodness, and without whose light our mind is too blind to be capable of\nany sight, and too stupid to be capable of the least relish of spiritual\nthings. But instead of one favour of God, which they mention, we\nacknowledge three. For, first, the Lord teaches and instructs us by his\nword; secondly, he confirms us by his sacraments; lastly, he illuminates\nour minds by the light of his Holy Spirit, and opens an entrance into\nour hearts for the word and sacraments; which otherwise would only\nstrike the ears and present themselves to the eyes, without producing\nthe least effect upon the mind.\nIX. With respect to the confirmation and increase of faith, therefore, I\nwish the reader to be apprized, and I conceive I have already expressed,\nin language too plain to be misunderstood, that I assign this office to\nthe sacraments; not from an opinion of their possessing a perpetual\ninherent virtue, efficacious of itself to the advancement or\nconfirmation of faith; but because they have been instituted by the Lord\nfor the express purpose of promoting its establishment and augmentation.\nBut they only perform their office aright when they are accompanied by\nthe Spirit, that internal Teacher, by whose energy alone our hearts are\npenetrated, our affections are moved, and an entrance is opened for the\nsacraments into our souls. If he be absent, the sacraments can produce\nno more effect upon our minds than the splendour of the sun on blind\neyes, or the sound of a voice on deaf ears. I make such a distinction\nand distribution, therefore, between the Spirit and the sacraments, that\nI consider all the energy of operation as belonging to the Spirit, and\nthe sacraments as mere instruments, which, without his agency, are vain\nand useless, but which, when he acts and exerts his power in the heart,\nare fraught with surprising efficacy. Now, it is evident how, according\nto this opinion, the faith of a pious mind is confirmed by the\nsacraments; namely, as the eyes see by the light of the sun, and the\nears hear by the sound of a voice: the light would have no effect upon\nthe eyes, unless they had a natural faculty capable of being\nenlightened; and it would be in vain for the ears to be struck with any\nsound, if they had not been naturally formed for hearing. But if it be\ntrue, as we ought at once to conclude, that what the visive faculty is\nin our eyes towards our beholding the light, and the faculty of hearing\nis in our ears towards our perception of sound, such is the work of the\nHoly Spirit in our hearts for the formation, support, preservation, and\nestablishment of our faith; then these two consequences immediately\nfollow—that the sacraments are attended with no benefit without the\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit; and that, in hearts already instructed by\nthat Teacher, they still subserve the confirmation and increase of\nfaith. There is only this difference, that our eyes and ears are\nnaturally endued with the faculties of seeing and hearing, but Christ\naccomplishes this in our hearts by special and preternatural grace.\nX. This reasoning will also serve for a solution of the objections with\nwhich some persons are greatly disturbed; that if we attribute to\ncreatures either the increase or confirmation of faith, we derogate from\nthe Spirit of God, whom we ought to acknowledge as its sole Author. For\nwe do not, at the same time, deny him the praise of its confirmation and\nincrease; but we assert that the way in which he increases and confirms\nour faith is by preparing our minds, by his inward illumination, to\nreceive that confirmation which is proposed in the sacraments. If the\nway in which this has been expressed be too obscure, it shall be\nelucidated by the following similitude. If you intend to persuade a\nperson to do a certain act, you will consider all the reasons calculated\nto draw him over to your opinion, and to constrain him to submit to your\nadvice. But you will make no impression upon him, unless he possess a\nperspicuous and acute judgment, to be able to determine what force there\nis in your reasons; unless his mind also be docile, and prepared to\nlisten to instruction; and lastly, unless he have conceived such an\nopinion of your fidelity and prudence as may prepossess him in favour of\nyour sentiments. For there are many obstinate spirits, never to be moved\nby any reasons; and where a person’s fidelity is suspected, and his\nauthority despised, little effect will be produced, even with those who\nare disposed to learn. On the contrary, let all these things be present,\nand they will insure the acquiescence of the person advised, in those\ncounsels which he would otherwise have derided. This work also the\nSpirit effects within us. Lest the word should assail our ears in\nvain,—lest the sacraments should in vain strike our eyes,—he shows us\nthat it is God who addresses us in them; he softens the hardness of our\nhearts, and forms them to that obedience which is due to the word of the\nLord; in fine, he conveys those external words and sacraments from the\nears into the soul. Our faith is confirmed, therefore, both by the word\nand by the sacraments, when they place before our eyes the good-will of\nour heavenly Father towards us, in the knowledge of which all the\nfirmness of our faith consists, and by which its strength is augmented;\nthe Spirit confirms it, when he makes this confirmation effectual by\nengraving it on our minds. In the mean time, the Father of lights cannot\nbe prohibited from illuminating our minds by means of the lustre of the\nsacraments, as he enlightens our bodily eyes with the rays of the sun.\nXI. That there is this property in the external word, our Lord has shown\nin a parable, by calling it “seed.”[1110] For as seed, if it fall on a\ndesert and neglected spot of ground, will die without producing any\ncrop, but if it be cast upon a well manured and cultivated field, it\nbrings forth its fruit with an abundant increase,—so the word of God, if\nit fall upon some stiff neck, will be as unproductive as seed dropped\nupon the sea-shore; but if it light upon a soul cultivated by the agency\nof the heavenly Spirit, it will be abundantly fruitful. Now, if the word\nbe justly compared to seed,—as we say that from seed, corn grows,\nincreases, and comes to maturity,—why may we not say that faith derives\nits commencement, increase, and perfection, from the word of God? Paul,\nin different places, excellently expresses both these things. For, with\na view to recall to the recollection of the Corinthians with what\nefficacy God had attended his labours, he glories in having the ministry\nof the Spirit, as if there were an indissoluble connection between his\npreaching and the power of the Holy Spirit operating to the illumination\nof their minds, and the excitement of their hearts.[1111] But in another\nplace, with a view to apprize them how far the power of the word of God\nextends, merely as preached by man, he compares ministers to husbandmen;\nwho, when they have employed their labour and industry in cultivating\nthe ground, have nothing more that they can do. But what would\nploughing, and sowing, and watering, avail, unless heavenly goodness\ncaused the seed to vegetate? Therefore he concludes, “Neither is he that\nplanteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God, that giveth the\nincrease.”[1112] The apostles, then, in their preaching, exerted the\npower of the Spirit, as far as God made use of the instruments appointed\nby himself for the exhibition of his spiritual grace. But we must always\nkeep in view this distinction, that we may remember how far the power of\nman extends, and what is exclusively the work of God.\nXII. Now, it is so true that the sacraments are confirmations of our\nfaith, that sometimes, when the Lord intends to take away the confidence\nof those things which had been promised in the sacraments, he removes\nthe sacraments themselves. When he deprived Adam of the gift of\nimmortality, he expelled him from the garden of Eden, saying, “Lest he\nput forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live\nfor ever.”[1113] What can be the meaning of this language? Could the\nfruit restore to Adam the incorruption from which he had now fallen?\nCertainly not. But it was the same as if the Lord had said, Lest he\nshould cherish a vain confidence, if he retain the symbol of my promise,\nlet him be deprived of that which might give him some hope of\nimmortality. For the same reason, when the apostle exhorts the Ephesians\nto “remember that” they “were without Christ, being aliens from the\ncommonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise,\nhaving no hope, and without God in the world,” he states that they were\nnot partakers of circumcision;[1114] thereby signifying that not having\nreceived the sign of the promise, they were excluded from the promise\nitself. To the other objection which they make, that the glory of God is\ntransferred to creatures to whom so much power is attributed, and\nthereby sustains a proportionate diminution, it is easy to answer, that\nwe place no power in creatures; we only maintain that God uses such\nmeans and instruments as he sees will be suitable, in order that all\nthings may be subservient to his glory, as he is the Lord and Ruler of\nall. Therefore, as by bread and other aliments he feeds our bodies, as\nby the sun he enlightens the world, as by fire he produces warmth,—yet\nbread, the sun, and fire, are nothing but instruments by which he\ndispenses his blessings to us,—so he nourishes our faith in a spiritual\nmanner by the sacraments, which are instituted for the purpose of\nplacing his promises before our eyes for our contemplation, and of\nserving us as pledges of them. And as we ought not to place any\nconfidence in the other creatures, which, by the liberality and\nbeneficence of God, have been destined to our uses, and by whose\ninstrumentality he communicates to us the bounties of his goodness, nor\nto admire and celebrate them as the causes of our enjoyments,—so neither\nought our confidence to rest in the sacraments, or the glory of God to\nbe transferred to them; but, forsaking all other things, both our faith\nand confession ought to rise to him, the Author of the sacraments and of\nevery other blessing.\nXIII. The argument which some persons adduce from the very name of\n_sacrament_ is destitute of any force;—though the word _sacrament_ has\nvarious significations in authors of the first authority, yet it has but\none which has any agreement or connection with _signs_ or _standards_,\n(signa;) that is, when it denotes the solemn oath taken by a soldier to\nhis commander when he enters on a military life. For as by the military\noath new soldiers bind themselves to their commander, and assume the\nmilitary profession, so by our signs we profess Christ to be our Leader,\nand declare that we fight under his banners. They add similitudes for\nthe further elucidation of their opinion. As the dress of the Romans,\nwho wore gowns, distinguished them from the Greeks, who wore cloaks; as\nthe different orders among the Romans were distinguished from each other\nby their respective badges, the senatorial order from the equestrian by\npurple habits and round shoes, and the equestrian from the plebeian by a\nring; as French and English ships of war are known by flags of different\ncolours, the French flags being white and the English red; so we have\nour signs or badges to distinguish us from unbelievers. But from the\nobservations already made, it is evident that the ancient fathers, who\ngave our signs the name of sacraments, were not at all guided by the\nprevious use of this word in Latin writers; but that they gave it a new\nsense for their own convenience, simply denoting sacred signs. And if we\nwish to carry our researches any further, it may be found that they\ntransferred this name to the signification now given, on the same\nprinciple of analogy which induced them to transfer the word _faith_ to\nthe sense in which it is now used. For as faith properly signifies truth\nin the fulfilment of promises, yet they have applied it to the assurance\nor certain persuasion which a person has of the truth itself; so, as a\nsacrament is an oath by which a soldier binds himself to his leader,\nthey have applied it to the sign by which the leader receives soldiers\ninto his army. For by the sacraments the Lord promises that he will be\nour God, and that we shall be his people. But we pass over such\nsubtleties, as I think I have proved by sufficient arguments that the\nancients had no other view, in their application of the word\n_sacrament_, than to signify that the ceremonies to which they applied\nit were signs of holy and spiritual things. We admit the comparison\ndeduced from external badges, but we cannot bear that the last and least\nuse of the sacraments should be represented as their principal and even\nsole object. The first object of them is, to assist our faith towards\nGod; the second, to testify our confession before men. The similitudes\nwhich have been mentioned are applicable to this secondary design, but\nthe primary one ought never to be forgotten; for otherwise, as we have\nseen, these mysteries would cease to interest us, unless they were aids\nof our faith, and appendices of doctrine, destined to the same use and\nend.\nXIV. On the other hand, we require to be apprized, that as these persons\nweaken the force of the sacraments, and entirely subvert their use, so\nthere are others of a contrary party, who attribute to the sacraments I\nknow not what latent virtues, which are nowhere represented as\ncommunicated to them by the word of God. By this error the simple and\ninexperienced are dangerously deceived, being taught to seek the gifts\nof God where they can never be found, and being gradually drawn away\nfrom God to embrace mere vanity instead of his truth. For the\nsophistical schools have maintained, with one consent, that the\nsacraments of the new law, or those now used in the Christian Church,\njustify and confer grace, provided we do not obstruct their operation by\nany mortal sin. It is impossible to express the pestilent and fatal\nnature of this opinion, and especially as it has prevailed over a large\npart of the world, to the great detriment of the Church, for many ages\npast. Indeed, it is evidently diabolical; for by promising justification\nwithout faith, it precipitates souls into destruction: in the next\nplace, by representing the sacraments as the cause of justification, it\nenvelops the minds of men, naturally too much inclined to the earth, in\ngross superstition, leading them to rest in the exhibition of a\ncorporeal object rather than in God himself. Of these two evils I wish\nwe had not had such ample experience as to supersede the necessity of\nmuch proof. What is a sacrament, taken without faith, but the most\ncertain ruin of the Church? For as nothing is to be expected from it,\nbut in consequence of the promise, which denotes God’s wrath against\nunbelievers as much as it offers his grace to believers,—the person who\nsupposes that the sacraments confer any more upon him than that which is\noffered by the word of God, and which he receives by a true faith, is\ngreatly deceived. Hence also it may be concluded, that confidence of\nsalvation does not depend on the participation of the sacraments, as\nthough that constituted our justification, which we know to be placed in\nChrist alone, and to be communicated to us no less by the preaching of\nthe gospel than by the sealing of the sacraments, and that it may be\ncompletely enjoyed without this participation. So true is the\nobservation, which has also been made by Augustine, that invisible\nsanctification may exist without the visible sign, and, on the contrary,\nthat the visible sign may be used without real sanctification. For, as\nhe also writes in another place, “Men put on Christ, sometimes by the\nreception of a sacrament, sometimes by sanctification of life.” The\nfirst case may be common to the good and the bad; the second is peculiar\nto believers.\nXV. Hence that distinction, if it be well understood, which is\nfrequently stated by Augustine, between a sacrament and the matter of a\nsacrament. For his meaning is, not only that a sacrament contains a\nfigure, and some truth signified by that figure, but that their\nconnection is not such as to render them inseparable from each other;\nand even when they are united, the thing signified ought always to be\ndistinguished from the sign, that what belongs to the one may not be\ntransferred to the other. He speaks of their separation, when he\nobserves, that “the sacraments produce the effect which they represent,\nin the elect alone.” Again, when he is speaking of the Jews: “Though the\nsacraments were common to all, the grace which is the power of the\nsacrament was not common; so now, also, the washing of regeneration is\ncommon to all; but the grace itself, by which the members of Christ are\nregenerated with their Head, is not common to all.” Again, in another\nplace, speaking of the Lord’s supper: “We also in the present day\nreceive visible meat; but the sacrament is one thing, and the power of\nthe sacrament is another. How is it that many receive of the altar and\ndie, and die in consequence of receiving? For the morsel of bread given\nby the Lord to Judas was poison; not because Judas received an evil\nthing, but because, being a wicked man, he received a good thing in a\nsinful manner.” A little after: “The sacrament of this thing, that is,\nof the unity of the body and blood of Christ, is prepared on the table\nof the Lord, in some places daily, in other places on appointed days, at\nstated intervals of time; and is thence received, by some to life, by\nothers to destruction. But the thing signified by this sacrament is\nreceived, not to destruction, but to life, by every one who partakes of\nit.” He had just before said, “He shall not die, who eats; I refer not\nto the visible sacrament, but to the power of the sacrament; who eats\ninternally, not externally; he who eats in his heart, not he who presses\nwith his teeth.” In all these passages we find it maintained, that a\nsacrament is separated from the truth signified in it, by the\nunworthiness of a person who receives it amiss, so that there is nothing\nleft in it but a vain and useless figure. In order to enjoy the thing\nsignified together with the sign, and not a mere sign destitute of the\ntruth it was intended to convey, it is necessary to apprehend by faith\nthe word which is contained in it. Thus, in proportion to the communion\nwe have with Christ by means of the sacraments, will be the advantage\nwhich we shall derive from them.\nXVI. If this be obscure in consequence of its brevity, I will explain it\nmore at large. I affirm that Christ is the matter, or substance, of all\nthe sacraments; since they have all their solidity in him, and promise\nnothing out of him. So much more intolerable is the error of Peter\nLombard, who expressly makes them causes of righteousness and salvation,\nof which they are parts. Leaving all causes, therefore, of human\ninvention, we ought to adhere to this one cause. As far as we are\nassisted by their instrumentality, to nourish, confirm, and increase our\nfaith in Christ, to obtain a more perfect possession of him and an\nenjoyment of his riches, so far they are efficacious to us; and this is\nthe case when we receive by true faith that which is offered in them. Do\nthe impious, then, it will be said, by their ingratitude, frustrate the\nordinance of God, and cause it to come to nothing? I reply, that what I\nhave said is not to be understood as implying, that the virtue and truth\nof a sacrament depends on the condition or choice of him who receives\nit. For what God has instituted continues unshaken, and retains its\nnature, however men may vary; but as it is one thing to offer, and\nanother to receive, there is no incongruity in maintaining, that a\nsymbol, consecrated by the word of the Lord, is in reality what it is\ndeclared to be, and preserves its virtue, and yet that it confers no\nbenefit on a wicked and impious person. But Augustine happily solves\nthis question in a few words: he says, “If thou receive it carnally,\nstill it ceases not to be spiritual; but it is not so to thee.” And, as\nin the passages already cited, this father shows that the symbol used in\na sacrament is of no value, if it be separated from the truth signified\nby it, so, on the other hand, he states that it is necessary to\ndistinguish them, even where they are united, lest our attention be\nconfined too much to the external sign. “As to follow the letter,” says\nhe, “and to take the signs instead of the things signified, betrays\nservile weakness, so it is the part of unsteadiness and error to\ninterpret the signs in such a manner as to derive no advantage from\nthem.” He mentions two faults, against which it is necessary to guard.\nOne is, when we take the signs as if they were given in vain, and\ndisparaging or diminishing their secret significations by our perverse\nmisconstruction, exclude ourselves from the advantage which we ought to\nderive from them. The other is, when, not elevating our minds beyond the\nvisible sign, we transfer to the sacraments the praise of those\nbenefits, which are only conferred upon us by Christ alone, and that by\nthe agency of the Holy Spirit, who makes us partakers of Christ himself,\nby the instrumentality of the external signs which invite us to Christ,\nbut which cannot be perverted to any other use, without a shameful\nsubversion of all their utility.\nXVII. Wherefore let us abide by this conclusion, that the office of the\nsacraments is precisely the same as that of the word of God; which is to\noffer and present Christ to us, and in him the treasures of his heavenly\ngrace; but they confer no advantage or profit without being received by\nfaith; just as wine, or oil, or any other liquor, though it be poured\nplentifully on a vessel, yet will it overflow and be lost, unless the\nmouth of the vessel be open; and the vessel itself, though wet on the\noutside, will remain dry and empty within. It is also necessary to guard\nagainst being drawn into an error allied to this, from reading the\nextravagant language used by the fathers with a view to exalt the\ndignity of the sacraments; lest we should suppose there is some secret\npower annexed and attached to the sacraments, so that they communicate\nthe grace of the Holy Spirit, just as wine is given in the cup; whereas\nthe only office assigned to them by God, is to testify and confirm his\nbenevolence towards us; nor do they impart any benefit, unless they are\naccompanied by the Holy Spirit to open our minds and hearts, and render\nus capable of receiving this testimony: and here, also, several distinct\nfavours of God are eminently displayed. For the sacraments, as we have\nbefore hinted, fulfil to us, on the part of God, the same office as\nmessengers of joyful intelligence, or earnests for the confirmation of\ncovenants on the part of men; they communicate no grace from themselves,\nbut announce and show, and, as earnests and pledges, ratify, the things\nwhich are given to us by the goodness of God. The Holy Spirit, whom the\nsacraments do not promiscuously impart to all, but whom God, by a\npeculiar privilege, confers upon his servants, is he who brings with him\nthe graces of God, who gives the sacraments admission into our hearts,\nand causes them to bring forth fruit in us. Now, though we do not deny\nthat God himself accompanies his institution by the very present power\nof his Spirit, that the administration of the sacraments which he has\nordained may not be vain and unfruitful, yet we assert the necessity of\na separate consideration and contemplation of the internal grace of the\nSpirit, as it is distinguished from the external ministry. Whatever God\npromises and adumbrates in signs, therefore, he really performs; and the\nsigns are not without their effect, to prove the veracity and fidelity\nof their Author. The only question here is, whether God works by a\nproper and intrinsic power, as it is expressed, or resigns the office to\nexternal symbols. Now, we contend, that whatever instruments he employs,\nthis derogates nothing from his supreme operation. When this doctrine is\nmaintained respecting the sacraments, their dignity is sufficiently\nannounced, their use plainly signified, their utility abundantly\ndeclared, and a proper moderation is preserved in all these particulars,\nso that nothing is attributed, which ought not to be attributed to them,\nand nothing that belongs to them is denied; while there is no admission\nof that figment, which places the cause of justification and the power\nof the Spirit in the sacramental elements, as in so many vehicles; and\nthat peculiar power which has been omitted by others is clearly\nexpressed. Here, also, it must be remarked, that God accomplishes\nwithin, that which the minister represents and testifies by the external\nact; that we may not attribute to a mortal man what God challenges\nexclusively to himself. Augustine has judiciously suggested the same\nsentiment. “How,” says he, “do Moses and God both sanctify? Not Moses\ninstead of God. Moses does it with visible signs, by his ministry. God\ndoes it with invisible grace, by his Holy Spirit. Here also lies all the\nefficacy of visible sacraments. For what avail those visible sacraments\nwithout that sanctification of invisible grace?”\nXVIII. The term _sacrament_, as we have hitherto treated of its nature,\ncomprehends generally all the signs which God has ever given to men, to\ncertify and assure them of the truth of his promises. These he has been\npleased to place in natural things, and sometimes to exhibit in\nmiracles. Examples of the former kind are such as these: when he gave\nAdam and Eve the tree of life, as a pledge of immortality, which they\nmight assure themselves of enjoying as long as they should eat of the\nfruit of that tree;[1115] and when he “set” his “bow in the cloud,” as a\ntoken to Noah and his posterity, that there should “no more be a flood\nto destroy the earth.”[1116] These Adam and Noah had as sacraments. Not\nthat the tree would actually communicate immortality to them, which it\ncould not give to itself; or that the rainbow, which is merely a\nrefraction of the rays of the sun on the opposite clouds, would have any\nefficacy in restraining the waters; but because they had a mark\nimpressed upon them by the word of God, constituting them signs and\nseals of his covenants. The tree and the rainbow both existed before,\nbut when they were inscribed with the word of God, they were endued with\na new form, so that they began to be something that they were not\nbefore. And that no one may suppose this to be spoken in vain, the bow\nitself continues to be a witness to us in the present age, of that\ncovenant which God made with Noah: whenever we behold it, we read this\npromise of God in it, that he would never more destroy the earth with a\nflood. Therefore, if any smatterer in philosophy, with a view to\nridicule the simplicity of our faith, contend that such a variety of\ncolours is the natural result of the refraction of the solar rays on an\nopposite cloud, we must immediately acknowledge it, but we may smile at\nhis stupidity in not acknowledging God as the Lord and Governor of\nnature, who uses all the elements according to his will for the\npromotion of his own glory. And if he had impressed similar characters\non the sun, on the stars, on the earth, and on stones, they would all\nhave been sacraments to us. Why is not silver of as much value before it\nis coined, as it is after, since the metal is the very same? The reason\nis, that it has nothing added to its natural state; stamped with a\npublic impression, it becomes money, and receives a new valuation. And\nshall not God be able to mark his creatures with his word, that they may\nbecome sacraments, though before they were mere elements? Examples of\nthe second kind were exhibited, when God showed Abraham “a smoking\nfurnace and a burning lamp;”[1117] when he watered the fleece with dew\nwhile the earth remained dry, and afterwards bedewed the earth without\nwetting the fleece, to promise victory to Gideon;[1118] when “he brought\nthe shadow ten degrees backward in the dial,”[1119] to promise recovery\nto Hezekiah. As these things were done to support and establish the\nweakness of their faith, they also were sacraments.\nXIX. But our present design is to treat particularly of those sacraments\nwhich the Lord has appointed to be ordinarily used in his Church, to\nkeep his worshippers and servants in one faith and in the confession of\nthe same. “For,” to use the language of Augustine, “men cannot be united\nin any profession of religion, whether true or false, unless they are\nconnected by some communion of visible signs or sacraments.” Our most\nmerciful Father, therefore, foreseeing this necessity, did, from the\nbeginning, institute for his servants certain exercises of piety, which\nSatan afterwards depraved and corrupted in a variety of ways,\ntransferring them to impious and idolatrous worship. Hence those\ninitiations of the heathen into their mysteries, and the rest of their\ndegenerate rites, which, though fraught with error and superstition, at\nthe same time furnish an evidence that such external signs are\nindispensable to a profession of religion. But as they were neither\nfounded on the word of God, nor referred to that truth which ought to be\nthe object of all religious emblems, they are unworthy of notice, where\nmention is made of the sacred symbols which have been instituted by God,\nand which have never been perverted from their original principle, which\nconstitutes them aids of true piety. Now, they consist not of mere\nsigns, like the rainbow and the tree of life, but in ceremonies; or,\nrather, the signs which are here given are ceremonies. And, as we have\nbefore observed, as they are testimonies of grace and salvation on the\npart of the Lord, so on our part they are badges of our profession, by\nwhich we publicly devote ourselves to God, and swear obedience and\nfidelity to him. Chrysostom, therefore, somewhere properly calls them\n_compacts_, by which God covenants with us, and we bind ourselves to\npurity and sanctity of life; because a mutual stipulation is made in\nthem between God and us. For as the Lord promises to obliterate and\nefface all the guilt and punishment that we have incurred by sin, and\nreconciles us to himself in his only begotten Son, so we, on our parts,\nby this profession, bind ourselves to him, to serve him in piety and\ninnocence of life; so that such sacraments may justly be described as\nceremonies by which God is pleased to exercise his people, in the first\nplace, to nourish, excite, and confirm faith in their hearts; and in the\nnext place, to testify their religion before men.\nXX. And even the sacraments have been different according to the\nvarieties of different periods, and corresponding to the dispensation by\nwhich it has pleased the Lord to manifest himself in different ways to\nmankind. For to Abraham and his posterity circumcision was commanded; to\nwhich the law of Moses afterwards added ablutions, sacrifices, and other\nrites. These were the sacraments of the Jews till the coming of Christ;\nwhich was followed by the abrogation of these, and the institution of\ntwo others, which are now used in the Christian Church; namely, baptism\nand the supper of the Lord. I speak of those which were instituted for\nthe use of the whole Church; for as to the imposition of hands, by which\nthe ministers of the Church are introduced into their office, while I\nmake no objection to its being called a sacrament, I do not class it\namong the ordinary sacraments. What opinion ought to be entertained\nrespecting those which are commonly reputed the five other sacraments,\nwe shall see in a subsequent chapter. Those ancient sacrifices, however,\nreferred to the same object towards which ours are now directed, their\ndesign being to point and lead to Christ, or rather, as images, to\nrepresent and make him known. For as we have already shown that they are\nseals to confirm the promises of God, and it is very certain that no\npromise of God was ever offered to man except in Christ,—in order to\nteach us any thing respecting the promises of God, they must of\nnecessity make a discovery of Christ. This was the design of that\nheavenly pattern of the tabernacle and model of the legal worship, which\nwas exhibited to Moses in the mount. There is only one difference\nbetween those sacraments and ours: they prefigured Christ as promised\nand still expected; ours represent him as already come and manifested.\nXXI. All these things will be considerably elucidated by a particular\ndetail. In the first place, circumcision was a sign to the Jews to teach\nthem that whatever is produced from human seed—that is, the whole nature\nof man—is corrupt, and requires to be pruned: it was likewise a\ntestification and memorial to confirm them in the promise given to\nAbraham respecting the blessed seed, in whom all the nations of the\nearth were to be blessed, and from whom their own blessing was also to\nbe expected.[1120] Now, that blessed seed, as Paul informs us, was\nChrist, on whom alone they relied for recovering that which they had\nlost in Adam. Wherefore circumcision was the same to them as Paul\ndeclares it to have been to Abraham, even “a seal of the righteousness\nof faith;”[1121] that is, a seal for the further assurance that their\nfaith, with which they expected that seed, would be imputed by God to\nthem for righteousness. But the comparison between circumcision and\nbaptism we shall have more suitable occasion for pursuing in another\nplace. Ablutions and purifications placed before their eyes their\nuncleanness and pollution, by which they were naturally contaminated,\nand promised another ablution, by which they would be purified from all\ntheir defilement; and this ablution was Christ, washed in whose blood we\nbring his purity into the presence of God to cover all our\nimpurities.[1122] Their sacrifices accused and convicted them of their\niniquity, and, at the same time, taught the necessity of some\nsatisfaction to be made to the Divine justice, and that, therefore,\nthere would come a great High Priest, a Mediator between God and men,\nwho was to satisfy the justice of God by the effusion of blood and the\noblation of a sacrifice, which would be sufficient to obtain the\nremission of sins. This great High Priest was Christ; he shed his own\nblood, and was himself the victim; was obedient to his Father even unto\ndeath, and by his obedience obliterated the disobedience of man, which\nhad provoked the indignation of God.[1123]\nXXII. Our two sacraments present us with a clearer exhibition of Christ,\nin proportion to the nearer view of him which men have enjoyed since he\nwas really manifested by the Father in the manner in which he had been\npromised. For baptism testifies to us our purgation and ablution; the\neucharistic supper testifies our redemption. Water is a figure of\nablution, and blood of satisfaction. These things are both found in\nChrist, who, as John says, “came by water and blood;”[1124] that is, to\npurify and redeem. Of this the Spirit of God is a witness; or, rather,\n“there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the Water, and the\nBlood.”[1125] In the water and the blood we have a testimony of\npurgation and redemption; and the Spirit, as the principal witness,\nconfirms and secures our reception and belief of this testimony. This\nsublime mystery was strikingly exhibited on the cross, when blood and\nwater issued from Christ’s sacred side; which, on this account,\nAugustine has justly called “the fountain of our sacraments;” of which\nwe are yet to treat more at large. And there is no doubt, if we compare\none time with another, but that the more abundant grace of the Spirit is\nalso here displayed. For that belongs to the glory of the kingdom of\nChrist; as we gather from various places, and especially from the\nseventh chapter of John. In this sense we must understand that passage\nwhere Paul, speaking of the legal institutions, says, “which are a\nshadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.”[1126] His design\nin this declaration is, not to deny the efficacy of those testimonies of\ngrace, in which God was formerly pleased to attest his veracity to the\nfathers, as he does to us now in baptism and the sacred supper, but to\nrepresent the comparative superiority of what has been given to us, that\nno one might wonder at the ceremonies of the law having been abolished\nat the advent of Christ.\nXXIII. I will just observe by the way, that the doctrine of the schools,\nwhich asserts such a wide difference between the sacraments of the old\nand new law, as though the former merely prefigured the grace of God,\nand the latter actually communicated it, ought to be altogether\nexploded. For the apostle speaks in a manner equally as honourable of\nthe former as of the latter, when he states that the fathers, in the\ntime of Moses, “did all eat the same spiritual meat”[1127] with us, and\nexplains that meat to be Christ. Who will dare to call that an empty\nsign, which exhibited to the Jews the real communion of Christ? And the\nstate of the case, which the apostle is there discussing, is clearly in\nfavour of our argument. For, that no man might dare to despise the\njudgment of God, in a reliance on a speculative knowledge of Christ, and\nthe mere name of Christianity, with its external signs, he exhibits the\nexamples of Divine severity displayed among the Jews, to teach us that\nthe same punishments which they suffered await us, if we indulge in the\nsame sins. Now, that the comparison might be pertinent, it was necessary\nto show that there was no inequality between us and them in those\nprivileges of which he forbids us to indulge unfounded boasts. First,\ntherefore, he shows them to have been equal to us in the sacraments, and\nleaves not a particle of superiority capable of exciting in our minds\nthe least hope of impunity. Nor is it right to attribute to our baptism\nany thing more than he attributes to circumcision, when he calls it “a\nseal of the righteousness of faith.”[1128] Whatever is presented to us\nin the present day in our sacraments, was anciently received by the Jews\nin theirs—even Christ and his spiritual riches. Whatever power our\nsacraments have, they also experienced the same in theirs: they were\nseals of the Divine benevolence to them, confirming their hope of\neternal salvation. If the advocates of the opinion which we are opposing\nhad been skilful interpreters of the Epistle to the Hebrews, they would\nnot have been so deceived; but when they read there that sins were not\nexpiated by the legal ceremonies, and that the ancient shadows had no\npower to confer righteousness,—neglecting the comparison intended to be\ndrawn, and confining their attention to this single consideration, that\nthe law in itself was unprofitable to its observers, they have simply\nconcluded that the figures were destitute of any truth. But the design\nof the apostle was to represent the ceremonial law as of no value till\nit was referred to Christ, on whom alone depended all its efficacy.\nXXIV. But they will allege what Paul says of the “circumcision in the\nletter,”[1129] that it is in no estimation with God; that it confers no\nadvantage; that it is in vain; for such a representation they conceive\nto degrade it far below baptism. But this is not true; for all that he\nsays of circumcision might justly be affirmed of baptism. And it is\nactually asserted; first by Paul himself, where he shows that God\nregards not the external ablution by which we enter on the profession of\nreligion, unless the heart be purified within, and persevere in piety to\nthe end; and, secondly, by Peter, when he declares the truth of baptism\nto consist, not in “the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the\nanswer of a good conscience.”[1130] It will be objected, that Paul seems\nin another place utterly to despise “the circumcision made with hands,”\nwhen he compares it with “the circumcision of Christ.”[1131] I reply,\nthat that passage derogates nothing from its dignity. Paul is there\ndisputing against those who required it as still necessary, after it had\nbeen abrogated. He therefore admonishes believers to leave the ancient\nshadows, and adhere to the truth. These teachers, he says, urge you to\nbe circumcised in your bodies. But you have been spiritually circumcised\nboth in body and soul: you have the substance itself, therefore, which\nis better than the shadow. Some one might object to this, that the\nfigure was not to be despised in consequence of their having the\nsubstance; for that the fathers under the Old Testament had experienced\nthe circumcision of the heart, and the putting off of the old man, of\nwhich the apostle was speaking, and yet that external circumcision had\nnot been unnecessary or useless to them. He anticipates and supersedes\nthis objection, by immediately adding, that the Colossians had been\n“buried with Christ in baptism;” by which he signifies that baptism is\nto Christians what circumcision was to the ancient believers, and\nconsequently that circumcision cannot be imposed upon Christians without\ninjury to baptism.\nXXV. But our objectors proceed to allege, that a still stronger argument\nin their favour arises from what follows, which I have lately\nquoted,—that all the Jewish ceremonies were “a shadow of things to come,\nbut the body is of Christ;”[1132] and that the strongest argument of all\nis what is contained in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that the blood of\nbeasts did not reach the conscience, that “the law” had “a shadow of\ngood things to come, and not the very image of the things, and that the\nworshippers could never attain perfection from the Mosaic\nceremonies.”[1133] I repeat what I have already suggested, that Paul\ncalled the ceremonies _shadows_, not as if they had nothing solid in\nthem, but because their accomplishment had been deferred till the\nmanifestation of Christ. In the next place, I remark that this is to be\nunderstood, not of the efficacy of the ceremonies, but rather of the\nmode of representation. For till Christ was manifested in the flesh, all\nthe signs prefigured him as absent; however, he displayed his power, and\nconsequently himself, as present in the hearts of believers. But the\nprincipal thing to be observed is, that in all these places Paul is not\nspeaking of the subject, considered simply in itself, but with reference\nto those against whom he is contending. As he was combating the false\napostles, who maintained piety to consist in the ceremonies alone,\nwithout any regard to Christ,—nothing more was necessary for their\nconfutation, than to discuss what value ceremonies possess of\nthemselves. This also was the object pursued by the author of the\nEpistle to the Hebrews. Let us remember, therefore, that the question\nhere does not respect ceremonies, taken in their true and natural\nsignification, but as distorted by a false and perverse interpretation;\nthe controversy is not about the legitimate use, but the superstitious\nabuse of them. What wonder, then, is it, if ceremonies, separated from\nChrist, are divested of all their virtue? For all signs are reduced to\nnothing, when the thing signified is taken away. So when Christ was\naddressing those who supposed the manna to have been mere food for the\nbody, he accommodated his discourse to their gross notion, and said that\nhe would give them better food, to nourish their souls with the hope of\nimmortality.[1134] If a clearer solution be required, all that has been\nsaid may be comprised in these three observations: first, that all the\nceremonies of the law of Moses, unless they were directed to Christ,\nwere vain and useless; secondly, that they had reference to Christ, so\nthat when he was manifested in the flesh, they received their\naccomplishment; lastly, that it was necessary for them to be abolished\nat his advent, as a shadow vanishes in the clear light of the sun. But\nas I defer the more extended discussion of this subject to the chapter\nin which I intend to compare baptism with circumcision, I touch the more\nbriefly upon it here.\nXXVI. It is possible that these miserable sophists have been led into\nthis error by the extravagant encomiums on the sacraments which are\nfound in the writings of the fathers; as when Augustine says, that “the\nsacraments of the old law only promised the Saviour, but ours give\nsalvation.” Not observing that these and other similar forms of\nexpression were hyperbolical, they, also, on their part, have\npromulgated their hyperbolical dogmas, but in a sense altogether foreign\nfrom the writings of the fathers. For the meaning of Augustine in that\npassage was the same as in another, where he says, “The sacraments of\nthe Mosaic law announced Christ as afterwards to come; ours announce him\nas already come.” Again: “They were promises of things to be fulfilled;\nthese are signs of things accomplished;” as if he had said, that the old\nsacraments prefigured Christ while he was yet expected, but that ours\nexhibit him as present, since he has already come. Besides, he speaks of\nthe mode of representation, as he also shows in another place, where he\nsays, “The law and the prophets had sacraments announcing something\nfuture; but what they celebrated as about to come, the sacraments of our\ntime announce as already come.” His sentiments respecting their truth\nand efficacy he declares in several places; as when he says, “The\nsacraments of the Jews were different from ours in the signs; in the\nthing signified, they were equal; different in visible form, equal in\nspiritual efficacy.” Again: “In different signs, the same faith; in\ndifferent signs, just as in different words; because words change their\nsounds in different times, and words are no other than signs. The\nfathers drank the same spiritual drink as we; though their corporeal\ndrink was different. See, then, the signs have been varied without any\nchange in the faith. To them the Rock was Christ; to us, that which is\nplaced on the altar is Christ. And as a great sacrament, they drank the\nwater flowing from the Rock; what we drink, believers know. If we\nconsider the visible form, there was a difference; if we regard the\nintelligible signification, they drank the same spiritual drink.” In\nanother place: “In the mystery their meat and drink were the same as\nours; but the same in signification, not in form; because the very same\nChrist was prefigured to them in the Rock, and has been manifested to us\nin the flesh.” Yet in this respect, also, we admit that there is some\ndifference between their sacraments and ours. For both testify that the\npaternal benevolence of God is offered to us in Christ, together with\nthe graces of the Holy Spirit; but ours testify it in a more clear and\nevident manner. In both there is an exhibition of Christ, but the\nexhibition of him in ours is richer and fuller, corresponding to the\ndifference between the Old Testament and the New, of which we have\nalready treated. And this is what was intended by Augustine, whom I\nquote more frequently than any other, as the best and most faithful\nwriter of antiquity, when he states, that after the revelation of\nChrist, sacraments were instituted, “fewer in number, more noble in\nsignification, and more excellent in efficacy.” It is right, also, just\nto apprize the readers, that all the jargon of the sophists respecting\nthe _work wrought_ (_opus operatum_) is not only false, but repugnant to\nthe nature of the sacraments; which God has instituted, in order that\nbelievers, being poor and destitute of every good, may come to them\nsimply confessing their wants, and imploring him to supply them.\nConsequently, in receiving the sacraments, they perform nothing at all\nmeritorious, and the action itself being, as far as they are concerned,\nmerely passive, no _work_ can be attributed to them in it.\nFootnote 1095:\nEph. i. 9.\nFootnote 1096:\nEph. iii. 2, 3.\nFootnote 1097:\nCol. i. 26, 27.\nFootnote 1098:\n1 Tim. iii. 16.\nFootnote 1099:\nRom. x. 8.\nFootnote 1100:\nActs xv. 9.\nFootnote 1101:\n1 Peter iii. 21.\nFootnote 1102:\nRom. iv. 11.\nFootnote 1103:\nGal. iii. 27.\nFootnote 1104:\n1 Cor. xii. 13.\nFootnote 1105:\nLuke xvii. 5.\nFootnote 1106:\nMark ix. 24.\nFootnote 1107:\nActs viii. 37.\nFootnote 1108:\nPsalm cxix. 10; cxi. 1; cxxxviii. 1.\nFootnote 1109:\nPsalm xii. 2.\nFootnote 1110:\nMatt. xiii. 3-23.

          "title": "CHAPTER XV.",
          "content": "BAPTISM.\nBaptism is a sign of initiation, by which we are admitted into the\nsociety of the Church, in order that, being incorporated into Christ, we\nmay be numbered among the children of God. Now, it has been given to us\nby God for these ends, which I have shown to be common to all\nsacraments: first, to promote our faith towards him; secondly, to\ntestify our confession before men. We shall treat of both these ends of\nits institution in order. To begin with the first: from baptism our\nfaith derives three advantages, which require to be distinctly\nconsidered. The first is, that it is proposed to us by the Lord, as a\nsymbol and token of our purification; or, to express my meaning more\nfully, it resembles a legal instrument properly attested, by which he\nassures us that all our sins are cancelled, effaced, and obliterated, so\nthat they will never appear in his sight, or come into his remembrance,\nor be imputed to us. For he commands all who believe to be baptized for\nthe remission of their sins. Therefore those who have imagined that\nbaptism is nothing more than a mark or sign by which we profess our\nreligion before men, as soldiers wear the insignia of their sovereign as\na mark of their profession, have not considered that which was the\nprincipal thing in baptism; which is, that we ought to receive it with\nthis promise, “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.”[1135]\nII. In this sense we are to understand what is said by Paul, that Christ\nsanctifies and cleanses the Church “with the washing of water by the\nword;”[1136] and in another place, that “according to his mercy he saved\nus, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy\nGhost;”[1137] and by Peter, that “baptism doth save us.”[1138] For it\nwas not the intention of Paul to signify that our ablution and salvation\nare completed by the water, or that water contains in itself the virtue\nto purify, regenerate, and renew; nor did Peter mean that it was the\ncause of salvation, but only that the knowledge and assurance of it is\nreceived in this sacrament; which is sufficiently evident from the words\nthey have used. For Paul connects together the “word of life” and “the\nbaptism of water;” as if he had said that our ablution and\nsanctification are announced to us by the gospel, and by baptism this\nmessage is confirmed. And Peter, after having said that “baptism doth\nsave us,” immediately adds that it is “not the putting away of the filth\nof the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God,” which\nproceeds from faith. But, on the contrary, baptism promises us no other\npurification than by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ; which is\nemblematically represented by water, on account of its resemblance to\nwashing and cleansing. Who, then, can pretend that we are cleansed by\nthat water, which clearly testifies the blood of Christ to be our true\nand only ablution? So that, to refute the error of those who refer all\nto the virtue of the water, no better argument could be found, than in\nthe signification of baptism itself, which abstracts us, as well from\nthat visible element which is placed before our eyes, as from all other\nmeans of salvation, that it may fix our minds on Christ alone.\nIII. Nor must it be supposed that baptism is administered only for the\ntime past, so that for sins into which we fall after baptism it would be\nnecessary to seek other new remedies of expiation in I know not what\nother sacraments, as if the virtue of baptism were become obsolete. In\nconsequence of this error, it happened, in former ages, that some\npersons would not be baptized except at the close of their life, and\nalmost in the moment of their death, that so they might obtain pardon\nfor their whole life—a preposterous caution, which is frequently\ncensured in the writings of the ancient bishops. But we ought to\nconclude, that at whatever time we are baptized, we are washed and\npurified for the whole of life. Whenever we have fallen, therefore, we\nmust recur to the remembrance of baptism, and arm our minds with the\nconsideration of it, that we may be always certified and assured of the\nremission of our sins. For though, when it has been once administered,\nit appears to be past, yet it is not abolished by subsequent sins. For\nthe purity of Christ is offered to us in it; and that always retains its\nvirtue, is never overcome by any blemishes, but purifies and obliterates\nall our defilements. Now, from this doctrine we ought not to take a\nlicense for the commission of future sins; for it is very far from\ninculcating such presumption; it is only delivered to those who, when\nthey have sinned, groan under the fatigue and oppression of their\ntransgressions; in order to afford them some relief and consolation, and\nto preserve them from sinking into confusion and despair. Thus Paul\nsays, that Christ was “set forth to be a propitiation for the remission\nof sins that are past.”[1139] He does not deny that we have a constant\nand perpetual remission of sins in Christ, but signifies that he has\nbeen given by the Father only to miserable sinners, who sigh for the\nphysician to heal the wounds of a guilty conscience. To such the mercy\nof God is offered; while those who, from a remission of punishment, seek\nto derive an occasion and license for sinning, do nothing but draw down\nupon themselves the wrath and vengeance of God.\nIV. I know the common opinion is, that remission of sins, which at our\nfirst regeneration we receive by baptism alone, is afterwards obtained\nby repentance and the benefit of the keys. But the advocates of this\nopinion have fallen into an error, for want of considering that the\npower of the keys, of which they speak, is so dependent on baptism that\nit cannot by any means be separated from it. It is true, that the sinner\nreceives remission by the ministry of the Church; but not without the\npreaching of the gospel. Now, what is the nature of that preaching? That\nwe are cleansed from our sins by the blood of Christ. What sign and\ntestimony of that ablution is there, except baptism? We see, then, how\nthis absolution is referred to baptism. This error has produced the\nimaginary sacrament of penance; on which I have touched a little\nalready, and shall finish what remains in its proper place. Now, it is\nno wonder if men, whose groveling minds were inordinately attached to\nexternal things, have betrayed that corrupt propensity, by a discontent\nwith the pure institution of God, and an introduction of new expedients\ninvented by themselves; as if baptism itself were not a sacrament of\nrepentance; but if repentance be enjoined upon us as long as we live,\nthe virtue of baptism ought to be extended to the same period. Wherefore\nit is evident that the pious, whenever, in any part of their lives, they\nare distressed with a consciousness of their sins, may justly have\nrecourse to the remembrance of baptism, in order to confirm themselves\nin the confidence of their interest in that one perpetual ablution which\nis enjoyed in the blood of Christ.\nV. Baptism is also attended with another advantage: it shows us our\nmortification in Christ, and our new life in him. For, as the apostle\nsays, “So many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized\ninto his death: therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death,\nthat we should walk in newness of life.”[1140] In this passage he does\nnot merely exhort us to an imitation of Christ, as if he had said, that\nwe are admonished by baptism, that after the example of his death we\nshould die to sin, and that after the example of his resurrection we\nshould rise to righteousness; but he goes considerably further, and\nteaches us, that by baptism Christ has made us partakers of his death,\nin order that we may be ingrafted into it. And as the scion derives\nsubstance and nourishment from the root on which it is ingrafted, so\nthey, who receive baptism with the faith with which they ought to\nreceive it, truly experience the efficacy of Christ’s death in the\nmortification of the flesh, and also the energy of his resurrection in\nthe vivification of the spirit. Hence he deduces matter of exhortation,\nthat, if we are Christians, we ought to be “dead unto sin, but alive\nunto God.”[1141] He uses the same argument in another place; that we\n“are circumcised, putting off the body of the sins of the flesh,” after\nwe have been “buried with” Christ “in baptism.”[1142] And in this sense,\nin the passage already quoted, he calls it “the washing of regeneration\nand renewing.”[1143] Thus we are promised, first, the gratuitous\nremission of sins, and imputation of righteousness; and, secondly, the\ngrace of the Holy Spirit to reform us to newness of life.\nVI. The last advantage which our faith receives from baptism, is the\ncertain testimony it affords us, that we are not only ingrafted into the\nlife and death of Christ, but are so united as to be partakers of all\nhis benefits. For this reason he dedicated and sanctified baptism in his\nown body, that he might have it in common with us, as a most firm bond\nof the union and society which he has condescended to form with us; so\nthat Paul proves from it, that we are the children of God, because we\nhave put on Christ in baptism.[1144] Thus we see that the accomplishment\nof baptism is in Christ; whom, on this account, we call the proper\nobject of baptism. Therefore it is no wonder if the apostles baptized in\nhis name,[1145] though they had also been commanded to baptize in the\nname of the Father and of the Spirit.[1146] For all the gifts of God,\nwhich are presented in baptism, are found in Christ alone. Yet it cannot\nbe but that he who baptizes into Christ, equally invokes the name of the\nFather and of the Spirit. For we have purification in his blood, because\nour merciful Father, in his incomparable goodness, being pleased to\nreceive us to his mercy, has appointed this Mediator between us, to\nconciliate his favour to us. But we receive regeneration from his death\nand resurrection, when we are endued with a new and spiritual nature by\nthe sanctification of the Spirit. Of our purification and regeneration,\ntherefore, we obtain, and distinctly perceive, the cause in the Father,\nthe matter in the Son, and the efficacy in the Spirit. Thus John first,\nand the apostles afterwards, baptized “with the baptism of repentance\nfor the remission of sins;”[1147] by _repentance_, intending\nregeneration, and by _remission of sins_, ablution.\nVII. Hence also it is very certain that the ministry of John was\nprecisely the same as that which was afterwards committed to the\napostles. For their baptism was not different, though it was\nadministered by different hands; but the sameness of their doctrine\nshows their baptism to have been the same. John and the apostles agreed\nin the same doctrine; both baptized to repentance, both to remission of\nsins; both baptized in the name of Christ, from whom repentance and\nremission of sins proceed. John said of Christ, “Behold the Lamb of God,\nwhich taketh away the sin of the world;”[1148] thus acknowledging and\ndeclaring him to be the sacrifice acceptable to the Father, the procurer\nof righteousness, and the author of salvation. What could the apostles\nadd to this confession? Wherefore let no one be disturbed by the\nattempts of the ancient writers to distinguish and separate one baptism\nfrom the other; for their authority ought not to have weight enough to\nshake our confidence in the Scripture. For who will attend to\nChrysostom, who denies that remission of sins was included in the\nbaptism of John, rather than to Luke, who, on the contrary, affirms that\n“John came preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of\nsins?”[1149] Nor must we admit that subtlety of Augustine, “that in the\nbaptism of John sins were remitted in hope, but in the baptism of Christ\nthey were remitted in fact.” For as the evangelist clearly testifies\nthat John, in his baptism, promised the remission of sins, why should we\ndiminish this commendation, when no necessity constrains us to it? But\nif any difference be sought for in the word of God, the only difference\nthat will be found is, that John baptized in the name of him who was to\ncome, the apostles in the name of him who had already manifested\nhimself.\nVIII. The more abundant effusion of the graces of the Spirit, after the\nresurrection of Christ, contributes nothing to establish a diversity of\nbaptisms. For the baptism administered by the apostles, during his life\non earth, was called his; yet it was attended with no greater abundance\nof the Spirit than the baptism of John. And even after his ascension,\nthe Samaritans, even though they had been baptized in the name of Jesus,\nreceived no other gifts of the Spirit than those which were common to\nall believers, till Peter and John were sent to lay their hands upon\nthem.[1150] I suppose that the fathers were misled into an opinion, that\nthe baptism of John was merely a preparation for that of Christ,[1151]\nentirely from an apprehension that some persons, who had previously\nreceived the baptism of John, were baptized again by Paul. But that they\nwere mistaken in this point, shall be very clearly shown in the proper\nplace. What is the meaning, then, of the declaration of John, that he\n“baptized with water,” but that Christ would come to “baptize with the\nHoly Ghost and with fire?”[1152] This may be explained in few words; for\nhe did not mean to distinguish between one baptism and the other, but\nwas comparing himself with the person of Christ; that he was a minister\nof water, but that Christ was the giver of the Holy Spirit, and would\ndisplay this power by a visible miracle, on that day when he would send\ndown the Holy Spirit upon the apostles in the form of fiery\ntongues.[1153] What could the apostles boast beyond this? What more can\nthey pretend to, who baptize in the present day? For they are merely\nministers of the outward sign, and Christ is the author of the inward\ngrace; as the same ancient writers invariably teach, and especially\nAugustine, whose principal argument against the Donatists is, that\nwhatever be the character of the person who administers baptism, yet\nChrist alone presides in it.\nIX. These things, which we have stated respecting mortification and\nablution, were adumbrated in the people of Israel, whom, on this\naccount, the apostle declares to have been “baptized in the cloud and in\nthe sea.”[1154] Mortification was figuratively represented, when the\nLord, delivering them from the power and cruel servitude of Pharaoh,\nmade a way for them through the Red Sea, and drowned Pharaoh himself,\nand the Egyptians, their enemies, who pursued, and almost overtook them.\nFor in this manner, in baptism, he promises, and gives us a sign to\nassure us, that we are extricated and delivered by his power from the\ncaptivity of Egypt, that is, from the servitude of sin; that our\nPharaoh, that is, the devil, is drowned, though still he ceases not to\nharass and fatigue us. But as the Egyptians did not remain sunk to the\nbottom of the sea, but, being cast upon the shore, still terrified the\nIsraelites with the dreadful sight, though they were not able to injure\nthem, so this enemy of ours still threatens, displays his arms, and\nmakes himself felt, but cannot overcome. In the cloud there was an\nemblem of ablution. For as the Lord there covered them with a cloud,\naffording them refreshment, that they might not faint and be consumed by\nthe overpowering heat of the sun, so, in baptism, we acknowledge\nourselves to be covered and protected by the blood of Christ, that the\nseverity of God, which is indeed an intolerable flame, may not fall upon\nus. Though this mystery was then obscured, and known only to few\npersons, yet, as there is no other way of obtaining salvation but by\nthose two blessings of grace, the Lord, having adopted the ancient\nfathers as his heirs, was pleased to bestow upon them tokens of both.\nX. Now, we may clearly perceive the falsehood of the notion which some\nhave long ago disseminated, and which others persist in\nmaintaining,—that by baptism we are delivered and exempted from original\nsin, and from the corruption which has descended from Adam to all his\nposterity, and are restored to the same righteousness and purity of\nnature which Adam would have obtained if he had continued in the\nintegrity in which he was first created. For teachers of this kind have\nnever understood the nature of original sin, or original righteousness,\nor the grace of baptism. Now, we have already proved that original sin\nis the pravity and corruption of our nature, which first renders us\nobnoxious to the wrath of God, and then produces in us those works which\nthe Scripture calls “works of the flesh.”[1155] Therefore these two\nthings are to be distinctly observed: first, that our nature being so\nentirely depraved and vitiated, we are, on account of this very\ncorruption, considered as convicted and justly condemned in the sight of\nGod, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and\npurity. And therefore even infants themselves bring their own\ncondemnation into the world with them, who, though they have not yet\nproduced the fruits of their iniquity, yet have the seed of it within\nthem; even their whole nature is, as it were, a seed of sin, and\ntherefore cannot but be odious and abominable to God. By baptism,\nbelievers are certified that this condemnation is removed from them;\nsince, as we said, the Lord promises us by this sign, that a full and\nentire remission is granted both of the guilt which is to be imputed to\nus, and of the punishment to be inflicted on account of that guilt; they\nalso receive righteousness, such as the people of God may obtain in this\nlife; that is, only by imputation, because the Lord, in his mercy,\naccepts them as righteous and innocent.\nXI. The other thing to be remarked is, that this depravity never ceases\nin us, but is perpetually producing new fruits—those works of the flesh\nwhich we have already described, like the emission of flame and sparks\nfrom a heated furnace, or like the streams of water from an unfailing\nspring. For concupiscence never dies, nor is altogether extinguished in\nmen, till by death they are delivered from the body of death, and\nentirely divested of themselves. Baptism, indeed, promises us the\nsubmersion of our Pharaoh, and the mortification of sin; yet not so that\nit no longer exists, or gives us no further trouble; but only that it\nmay never overcome us. For as long as we live immured in this prison of\nthe body, the relics of sin will dwell in us; but if we hold fast by\nfaith the promise which God has given us in baptism, they shall not\ndomineer or reign over us. But let no one deceive himself, let no one\nflatter himself in his guilt, when he hears that sin always dwells in\nus. These things are not said in order that those who are already too\nprone to do evil may securely sleep in their sins, but only that those\nwho are tempted by their corrupt propensities may not faint and sink\ninto despondency; but that they may rather reflect that they are yet in\nthe way, and may consider themselves as having made some progress, when\nthey experience their corruptions diminishing from day to day, till they\nshall attain the mark at which they are aiming, even the final\ndestruction of their depravity, which will be accomplished at the close\nof this mortal life. In the mean time, let them not cease to fight\nmanfully, to animate themselves to constant advances, and to press\nforward to complete victory. For it ought to give additional impulse to\ntheir exertions, to see that, after they have been striving so long, so\nmuch still remains for them to do. We conclude, therefore, that we are\nbaptized into the mortification of the flesh, which commences in us at\nbaptism, which we pursue from day to day, and which will be perfected\nwhen we shall pass out of this life to the Lord.\nXII. Here we say nothing different from what is most clearly stated by\nPaul in the sixth and seventh chapters of the Epistle to the Romans. For\nafter he had argued respecting gratuitous righteousness,—because some\nimpious men concluded from that doctrine that they might live according\nto their own corrupt inclinations, as we are not accepted by God for the\nmerit of our works, he adds, that all who are clothed with the\nrighteousness of Christ are also regenerated by his Spirit, and that of\nthis regeneration we have an earnest in baptism. Hence he exhorts\nbelievers not to suffer sin to reign in their members. Because he knew\nthat there always remains some infirmity in them, that they might not be\ndejected on account of it, he adds for their consolation, that they are\nnot under the law. On the other hand, as it might seem to encourage\nlicentiousness in Christians, to say that they were not under the yoke\nof the law, he discusses the nature of that abrogation, and shows what\nis the use of the law—a question which he had already determined. The\nsum of all that he says is, that we are delivered from the rigour of the\nlaw to adhere to Christ; and that the office of the law is to convince\nus of our depravity, and lead us to a confession of our impotence and\nmisery. Now, because the depravity of our nature is not so easily\ndiscovered in a profane man who indulges his corrupt passions without\nany fear of God, he gives an example in a regenerate man, that is, in\nhimself. He says, therefore, that he has a perpetual conflict with the\nrelics of his corruption, and that he is bound with a miserable\nservitude, which prevents his entire consecration of himself to an\nobedience of the Divine law; so that he is constrained to exclaim, “O\nwretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this\ndeath?” If the children of God are captives detained in prison as long\nas they live, they cannot but feel great anxiety from reflection on\ntheir danger, unless there be something to obviate this fear. For this\npurpose, therefore, he has added a consolation, that “there is now no\ncondemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus;”[1156] by which he\nteaches, that those whom the Lord has once received into his favour,\nincorporated into the communion of his Christ, and introduced by baptism\ninto the society of his Church, notwithstanding they are surrounded and\nassaulted with sin, and even carry sin about within them, yet while they\npersevere in the faith of Christ, are absolved from guilt and\ncondemnation. If this be the simple and genuine meaning of Paul, there\nis no reason why we should be considered as promulgating a new or\nstrange doctrine.\nXIII. Baptism also serves for our confession before men. For it is a\nmark by which we openly profess our desire to be numbered among the\npeople of God, by which we testify our agreement with all Christians in\nthe worship of one God, and in one religion, and by which we make a\npublic declaration of our faith; that the praises of God may not only be\nbreathed in the secret aspirations of our hearts, but may also be loudly\nproclaimed by our tongues, and by all the members of our body, in the\ndifferent modes in which they are capable of expressing them. For thus\nall that we have is devoted, as it ought to be, to the glory of God, to\nwhich every thing ought to be subservient, and by our example others are\nincited to the same pursuit. It was with this view that Paul inquired of\nthe Corinthians, whether they had not been baptized in the name of\nChrist; signifying that, in having been baptized in his name, they had\ndedicated themselves to him, had avowed him as their Lord and Master,\nand had bound themselves by a solemn obligation before men; so that they\ncould never again confess any other except him, unless they intended to\nrenounce the confession which they had made at their baptism.\nXIV. Now, as we have stated what was the design of our Lord in the\ninstitution of baptism, it is easy to judge in what manner we ought to\nuse and receive it. For as it is given for the support, consolation, and\nconfirmation of our faith, it requires to be received as from the hand\nof the Author himself: we ought to consider it as beyond all doubt, that\nit is he who speaks to us by this sign; that it is he who purifies and\ncleanses us, and obliterates the remembrance of our sins; that it is he\nwho makes us partakers of his death, who demolishes the kingdom of\nSatan, who weakens the power of our corrupt propensities, who even makes\nus one with himself, that, being clothed with him, we may be reckoned\nchildren of God; and that he as truly and certainly performs these\nthings internally on our souls, as we see that our bodies are externally\nwashed, immersed, and enclosed in water. For this analogy or similitude\nis a most certain rule of sacraments; that in corporeal things we\ncontemplate spiritual things, just as if they were placed before our\neyes, as it has pleased God to represent them to us by such figures: not\nthat such blessings are bound or enclosed in the sacrament, or that it\nhas the power to impart them to us; but only because it is a sign by\nwhich the Lord testifies his will, that he is determined to give us all\nthese things: nor does it merely feed our eyes with a bare prospect of\nthe symbols, but conducts us at the same time to the thing signified,\nand efficaciously accomplishes that which it represents.\nXV. We may see this exemplified in Cornelius the centurion, who, after\nhaving received the remission of his sins and the visible graces of the\nHoly Spirit, was baptized; not with a view to obtain by baptism a more\nample remission of sins, but a stronger exercise of faith, and an\nincrease of confidence from that pledge.[1157] Perhaps it may be\nobjected, “Why, then, did Ananias say to Paul, ‘Arise, and be baptized,\nand wash away thy sins,’[1158] if sins are not washed away by the\nefficacy of baptism itself?” I answer, We are said to receive or obtain\nthat which our faith apprehends, as presented to us by the Lord, whether\nat the time that he first declares it to us, or when, by any subsequent\ntestimony, he affords us a more certain confirmation of it. Ananias,\ntherefore, only intended to say to Paul, “That thou mayest be assured\nthat thy sins are forgiven, be baptized. For in baptism the Lord\npromises remission of sins; receive this and be secure.” It is not my\ndesign, however, to diminish the efficacy of baptism; but the substance\nand truth accompanies the sign, as God works by external means.\nNevertheless, from this sacrament, as from all others, we obtain nothing\nexcept what we receive by faith. If faith be wanting, it will be a\ntestimony of our ingratitude, to render us guilty before God, because we\nhave not believed the promise given in the sacrament; but as baptism is\na sign of our confession, we ought to testify by it, that our confidence\nis in the mercy of God, and our purity in the remission of sins, which\nis obtained for us by Jesus Christ; and that we enter into the Church of\nGod in order to live in the same harmony of faith and charity, of one\nmind with all the faithful. This is what Paul meant when he said, that\n“by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body.”[1159]\nXVI. Now, if it be true, as we have stated, that a sacrament is to be\nconsidered as received, not so much from the hand of him by whom it is\nadministered, as from the hand of God himself, from whom, without doubt,\nit proceeded, we may conclude that it is not capable of any addition or\ndiminution from the dignity of the person by whose hand it is delivered.\nAnd as, among men, if a letter be sent, provided the hand and seal of\nthe writer be known, it is of very little importance who and what the\ncarrier of it may be, so it ought to be sufficient for us to know the\nhand and seal of our Lord in his sacraments, by whatever messenger they\nmay be conveyed. This fully refutes the error of the Donatists, who\nmeasured the virtue and value of the sacrament by the worthiness of the\nminister. Such, in the present day, are our Anabaptists, who positively\ndeny that we are rightly baptized, because we were baptized by impious\nand idolatrous ministers in the kingdom of the pope, and therefore\nviolently urge us to be baptized again; against whose follies we shall\nbe fortified with an argument of sufficient strength, if we consider\nthat we are baptized not in the name of any man, but in the name of the\nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and consequently that it\nis not the baptism of man, but of God, by whomsoever it is administered.\nThough those who baptized us were chargeable with the grossest ignorance\nor contempt of God and of all religion, yet they did not baptize us into\nthe fellowship of their own ignorance or sacrilege, but into the faith\nof Jesus Christ; because they invoked, not their own name, but the name\nof God, and baptized in no other name but his. Now, if it was the\nbaptism of God, it certainly contained the promise of remission of sins,\nmortification of the flesh, spiritual vivification, and participation of\nChrist. Thus it was no injury to the Jews to have been circumcised by\nimpure and apostate priests; nor was the sign on that account useless,\nso as to render it necessary to be repeated, but it was sufficient to\nrecur to the genuine original. They object, that baptism ought to be\ncelebrated in the congregation of the godly; but this does not prove\nthat it loses all its value in consequence of being partially wrong. For\nwhen we teach what ought to be done to preserve baptism pure and free\nfrom every blemish, we do not abolish the institution of God, however\nidolaters corrupt it. For when circumcision was anciently corrupted with\nmany superstitions, yet it ceased not to be considered as a sign of\ngrace; nor, when Hezekiah and Josiah assembled together out of all\nIsrael those who had revolted from God, did they call any of them to a\nsecond circumcision.\nXVII. When they ask us what faith we had for many years after our\nbaptism, in order to show that our baptism was vain, since baptism is\nnot sanctified to us except by the word of promise received in faith,—to\nthis inquiry we answer, that being blind and unbelieving for a long\ntime, we did not embrace the promise which had been given us in baptism,\nyet that the promise itself, as it was from God, always remained steady,\nfirm, and true. Though all men were false and perfidious, yet God ceases\nnot to be true; though all men were lost, yet Christ remains a Saviour.\nWe confess, therefore, that during that time we received no advantage\nwhatever from baptism, because we totally neglected the promise offered\nto us in it, without which baptism is nothing. Now, since, by the grace\nof God, we have begun to repent, we accuse our blindness and hardness of\nheart for our long ingratitude to his great goodness; yet we believe\nthat the promise itself never expired, but, on the contrary, we reason\nin the following manner:—By baptism God promises remission of sins, and\nwill certainly fulfil the promise to all believers: that promise was\noffered to us in baptism; let us, therefore, embrace it by faith: it was\nlong dormant by reason of our unbelief; now, then, let us receive it by\nfaith. Wherefore, when God exhorts the Jewish people to repentance, he\ndoes not command them, who had been circumcised, as we have remarked, by\nimpious and sacrilegious hands, and who had lived for some time immersed\nin the same impiety, to be circumcised again: he only urges conversion\nof heart. For however the covenant had been violated by them, yet the\nsymbol of the covenant, according to the institution of the Lord, always\nremained firm and inviolable. On the sole condition of repentance,\ntherefore, they were restored to the covenant which God had once made\nwith them in circumcision; even though they had received it by the hands\nof the unfaithful priests, and had themselves done all that was in their\npower to corrupt it and render it ineffectual.\nXVIII. But they conceive themselves to be armed with an invincible\nargument, when they allege that Paul rebaptized some who had previously\nbeen baptized with the baptism of John.[1160] For if, by our own\nconfession, the baptism of John was in all respects the same as ours is\nnow,—as these persons who had first been erroneously instructed, after\nhaving been taught the right faith, were rebaptized into it, so that\nbaptism, which was unaccompanied with the true doctrine, should be\nconsidered as nothing, and we ought to be baptized afresh into the true\nreligion, which we have now first imbibed. It is supposed by some, that\nthey had received their first baptism from a pretended and corrupt\nimitator of John, who had rather baptized them into a vain superstition\nthan into the truth. This conjecture they seem to derive from the\nconfession of those persons that they were entirely ignorant of the Holy\nSpirit—an ignorance in which it is concluded John would not have\nsuffered his disciples to remain. But it is not probable that Jews, even\nthough they had never been baptized at all, would have been destitute of\nall knowledge of the Holy Spirit, who is celebrated in so many\ntestimonies of Scripture. The answer, therefore, which they gave, “We\nhave not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost,” is to be\nunderstood as equivalent to a declaration that they had never heard\nwhether the graces of the Spirit, respecting which Paul inquired, were\ngiven to the disciples of Christ. For myself, I grant that the baptism\nthey had received was the true baptism of John, and the very same with\nthe baptism of Christ; but I deny that they were baptized again. What is\nthe meaning of these words, “They were baptized in the name of the Lord\nJesus?” Some explain it to be, that they were only instructed by Paul in\nthe pure doctrine; but I prefer understanding it, in a more simple\nmanner, of the baptism of the Holy Spirit; that is, of the visible\ngraces of the Spirit given by imposition of hands. It is not uncommon in\nthe Scripture to designate those graces by the appellation of _baptism_;\nas on the day of Pentecost, the apostles are said to have remembered the\nwords of the Lord respecting the baptism of the Spirit and of fire. And\nPeter declared that he remembered the same, when he saw those graces\npoured out on Cornelius and his family and relatives. Nor is this\ninterpretation inconsistent with what is stated afterwards, that “When\nPaul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them.” For\nLuke does not relate two different things, but follows a mode of\nnarration familiar to the Hebrews, who first propose a subject\ngenerally, and then unfold it more in detail. This is obvious from the\nvery connection of the words; for he says, “When they heard this, they\nwere baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his\nhands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them.” The latter clause describes\nthe kind of baptism intended in the former. If ignorance vitiate a first\nbaptism, so that it requires to be corrected by a second, the first\npersons who ought to have been rebaptized were the apostles themselves,\nwho for three years after their baptism had scarcely any knowledge of\nthe least particle of pure doctrine. And among us, what rivers would be\nsufficient for the repetition of ablutions as numerous as the errors\nwhich are daily corrected in us by the mercy of the Lord!\nXIX. The virtue, dignity, utility, and end of this mystery, have now, if\nI mistake not, been sufficiently explained. With respect to the external\nsymbol, I sincerely wish that the genuine institution of Christ had the\ninfluence it ought to have, to repress the audacity of man. For, as\nthough it were a contemptible thing to be baptized in water, according\nto the precept of Christ, men have invented a benediction, or rather\nincantation, to pollute the true consecration of the water. They\nafterwards added a wax taper with chrism; exorcism seemed to open the\ngate to baptism. Now, though I am not ignorant of the ancient origin of\nthis adventitious medley, yet it is lawful for me and for all believers\nto reject every thing that men have presumed to add to the institution\nof Christ. Now, Satan, seeing that from the very first introduction of\nthe gospel, his impostures had been easily received by the foolish\ncredulity of the world, proceeded to grosser illusions; hence spittle,\nsalt, and other fooleries, which were publicly introduced with an\nunlimited license, to the reproach of baptism. From these experiments we\nmay learn that there is nothing holier, or better, or safer, than to\ncontent ourselves with the authority of Christ alone. How much better\nwas it, therefore, omitting all theatrical pomps which dazzle the eyes\nand stupefy the minds of the simple, whenever any one was to be\nbaptized, that he should be presented to the congregation of believers,\nand be offered to God in the presence and with the prayers of the whole\nChurch; that the confession of faith, in which the catechumen was to be\ninstructed, should be recited; that the promises which are included in\nbaptism should be declared; that the catechumen should be baptized in\nthe name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and lastly,\nthat he should be dismissed with prayers and thanksgivings! Thus nothing\nmaterial would be omitted; and that one ceremony, which was instituted\nby God, would shine with the greatest lustre, unencumbered with any\nextraneous corruptions. But whether the person who is baptized be wholly\nimmersed, and whether thrice or once, or whether water be only poured or\nsprinkled upon him, is of no importance; Churches ought to be left at\nliberty, in this respect, to act according to the difference of\ncountries. The very word _baptize_, however, signifies to immerse; and\nit is certain that immersion was the practice of the ancient Church.\nXX. It is also necessary to state, that it is not right for private\npersons to take upon themselves the administration of baptism; for this,\nas well as the administration of the Lord’s supper, is a part of the\npublic ministry of the Church. Christ never commanded women, or men in\ngeneral, to baptize; he gave this charge to those whom he had appointed\nto be apostles. And when he enjoined his disciples, in the celebration\nof the supper, to do as they had seen done by him when he executed the\noffice of a legitimate dispenser, he intended, without doubt, that they\nshould imitate his example. The custom, which has been received and\npractised for many ages past, and almost from the primitive times of the\nChurch, for baptism to be performed by laymen, in cases where death was\napprehended, and no minister was present in time, it appears to me\nimpossible to defend by any good reason. Indeed, the ancients\nthemselves, who either observed or tolerated this custom, were not\ncertain whether it was right or not. Augustine betrays this uncertainty,\nwhen he says, “And if a layman, compelled by necessity, has given\nbaptism, I know not whether any one may piously affirm that it ought to\nbe repeated. For if it be done without the constraint of necessity, it\nis a usurpation of an office which belongs to another; but if necessity\nobliges, it is either no offence, or a venial one.” Respecting women, it\nwas decreed without any exception, in the Council of Carthage, that they\nshould not presume to baptize at all, on pain of excommunication. But it\nis alleged, there is danger, lest a child, who is sick and dies without\nbaptism, should be deprived of the grace of regeneration. This I can by\nno means admit. God pronounces that he adopts our infants as his\nchildren, before they are born, when he promises that he will be a God\nto us, and to our seed after us. This promise includes their salvation.\nNor will any dare to offer such an insult to God as to deny the\nsufficiency of his promise to insure its own accomplishment. The\nmischievous consequences of that ill-stated notion, that baptism is\nnecessary to salvation, are overlooked by persons in general, and\ntherefore they are less cautious; for the reception of an opinion, that\nall who happen to die without baptism are lost, makes our condition\nworse than that of the ancient people, as though the grace of God were\nmore restricted now than it was under the law; it leads to the\nconclusion that Christ came not to fulfil the promises, but to abolish\nthem; since the promise, which at that time was of itself sufficiently\nefficacious to insure salvation before the eighth day, would have no\nvalidity now without the assistance of the sign.\nXXI. What was the custom of the Church before Augustine was born, may be\ncollected from the ancient fathers. In the first place, Tertullian says,\n“That it is not permitted for a woman to speak in the Church, neither to\nteach, nor to baptize, nor to offer, that she may not claim to herself\nthe functions of any office belonging to men, and especially to\npriests.” The same thing is fully attested by Epiphanius, when he\ncensures Marcion for having given women liberty to baptize. I am aware\nof the answer made to this by persons of opposite sentiments—that there\nis a great difference between a common usage, and an extraordinary\nremedy employed in cases of urgent necessity; but when Epiphanius\npronounces it to be a mockery, without making any exception, to give\nwomen liberty to baptize, it is sufficiently evident that he condemns\nthis corruption, and considers it inexcusable by any pretext whatever;\nnor does he add any limitation, in his third book, where he observes\nthat this liberty was not granted even to the holy mother of Christ.\nXXII. The example of Zipporah is alleged, but is not applicable to the\ncase. Because the angel of God was appeased after she had taken a stone\nand circumcised her son,[1161] it is unreasonable to infer that her\naction was approved by God. On the same principle it might be\nmaintained, that God was pleased with the worship established by the\nnations who were transplanted from Assyria to Samaria. But there are\nother powerful reasons to prove the absurdity of setting up the conduct\nof that foolish woman as a pattern for imitation. If I should allege,\nthat this was a single act, which ought not to be considered as a\ngeneral example, and especially as we nowhere find any special command\nthat the rite of circumcision was to be performed by the priests, the\ncase of circumcision is different from that of baptism; and this would\nbe sufficient to refute the advocates of its administration by women.\nFor the words of Christ are plain: “Go ye, therefore, and teach all\nnations, baptizing them.”[1162] Since he constitutes the same persons\npreachers of the gospel and administrators of baptism, “and no man,”\naccording to the testimony of the apostle, “taketh this honour upon\nhimself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron,”[1163] whoever\nbaptizes without a legitimate call, intrudes into another person’s\noffice. Even in the minutest things, as in meat and drink, whatever we\ndo with a doubtful conscience, Paul expressly declares to be sin.[1164]\nFemale baptism, therefore, being an open violation of the rule delivered\nby Christ, is a still greater sin; for we know that it is impious to\ndissever things which God has united. But all this I pass over; and\nwould only request my readers to consider that nothing was further from\nthe design of Zipporah, than to perform a service to God. For seeing her\nson to be in danger, she fretted and murmured, and indignantly cast the\nforeskin on the ground, reproaching her husband in such a manner as to\nbetray anger against God. In short, it is plain that all this proceeded\nfrom violence of temper, because she was displeased with God and her\nhusband that she was constrained to shed the blood of her son. Besides,\nif she had conducted herself with propriety in all other respects, yet\nit was an act of inexcusable presumption for her to circumcise her son\nin the presence of her husband, and that husband not a private man, but\nMoses, the principal prophet of God, who was never succeeded by a\ngreater in Israel; which was no more lawful for her to do, than it is\nfor women now to baptize in the presence of a bishop. But this\ncontroversy will easily be decided by the establishment of this\nprinciple—that infants are not excluded from the kingdom of heaven, who\nhappen to die before they have had the privilege of baptism. But we have\nseen that it is no small injustice to the covenant of God, if we do not\nrely upon it as sufficient of itself, since its fulfilment depends not\non baptism, or on any thing adventitious. The sacrament is afterwards\nadded as a seal, not to give efficacy to the promise of God, as if it\nwanted validity in itself, but only to confirm it to us. Whence it\nfollows, that the children of believers are not baptized, that they may\nthereby be made the children of God, as if they had before been\nstrangers to the Church; but, on the contrary, they are received into\nthe Church by a solemn sign, because they already belonged to the body\nof Christ by virtue of the promise. If the omission of the sign,\ntherefore, be not occasioned by indolence, or contempt, or negligence,\nwe are safe from all danger. It is far more consistent with piety to\nshow this reverence to the institution of God, not to receive the\nsacraments from any other hands than those to which the Lord has\ncommitted them. When it is impossible to receive them from the Church,\nthe grace of God is not so attached to them, but that we may obtain it\nby faith from the word of the Lord.\nFootnote 1135:\nMark xvi. 16.\nFootnote 1136:\nEph. v. 26.\nFootnote 1137:\nTitus iii. 5.\nFootnote 1138:\n1 Peter iii. 21.\nFootnote 1139:\nRom. iii. 25.\nFootnote 1140:\nRom. vi. 3, 4.\nFootnote 1141:\nRom. vi. 11.\nFootnote 1142:\nCol. ii. 11, 12.\nFootnote 1143:\nTitus iii. 6.\nFootnote 1144:\nGal. iii. 26, 27.\nFootnote 1145:\nActs viii. 16.\nFootnote 1146:\nMatt. xxviii. 19.\nFootnote 1147:\nMatt. iii. 6, 11.

          "content": "PÆDOBAPTISM PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH THE INSTITUTION OF CHRIST AND THE\nNATURE OF THE SIGN.\nAs some turbulent spirits in the present age have raised fierce\ndisputes, which still continue to agitate the Church, on the subject of\ninfant baptism, I cannot refrain from adding some observations with a\nview to repress their violence. If any one should think this chapter\nextended to an immoderate length, I would request him to consider, that\npurity of doctrine in a capital point, and the peace of the Church,\nought to be of too much importance in our estimation for us to feel any\nthing tedious which may conduce to the restoration of both. I shall also\nstudy to make this discussion of as much use as possible to a further\nelucidation of the mystery of baptism. They attack infant baptism with\nan argument which carries with it an appearance of great plausibility,\nasserting that it is not founded on any institution of Christ, but was\nfirst introduced by the presumption and corrupt curiosity of man, and\nafterwards received with foolish and inconsiderate facility. For a\nsacrament rests on no authority, unless it stands on the certain\nfoundation of the word of God. But what if, on a full examination of the\nsubject, it shall appear that this is a false and groundless calumny on\nthe holy ordinance of the Lord? Let us, therefore, inquire into its\nfirst origin. And if it shall be found to have been a mere invention of\nhuman presumption, we ought to renounce it, and regulate the true\nobservance of baptism solely by the will of God. But if it shall be\nproved to be sanctioned by his undoubted authority, it behoves us to\nbeware lest, by opposing the holy institutions of God, we offer an\ninsult to their Author himself.\nII. In the first place, it is a principle sufficiently known, and\nacknowledged by all believers, that the right consideration of\nsacramental signs consists not merely in the external ceremonies, but\nthat it chiefly depends on the promise and the spiritual mysteries which\nthe Lord has appointed those ceremonies to represent. Whoever,\ntherefore, wishes to be fully informed of the meaning of baptism, and\nwhat baptism is, must not fix his attention on the element and the\noutward spectacle, but must rather elevate his thoughts to the promises\nof God which are offered to us in it, and to those internal and\nspiritual things which it represents to us. He who discovers these\nthings, has attained the solid truth and all the substance of baptism,\nand thence he will also learn the reason and use of the external\nsprinkling. On the other hand, he who contemptuously disregards these\nthings, and confines his attention entirely to the visible ceremony,\nwill understand neither the force nor propriety of baptism, nor even the\nmeaning or use of the water. This sentiment is established by\ntestimonies of Scripture too numerous and clear to leave the least\nnecessity for pursuing it any further at present. It remains, therefore,\nthat from the promises given in baptism, we endeavour to deduce its\nnature and meaning. The Scripture shows, that the first thing\nrepresented in it, is the remission and purgation of sins, which we\nobtain in the blood of Christ; and the second the mortification of the\nflesh, which consists in the participation of his death, by which\nbelievers are regenerated to newness of life, and so into communion with\nhim. This is the sum to which we may refer every thing delivered in the\nScriptures concerning baptism, except that it is also a sign by which we\ntestify our religion before men.\nIII. As the people of God, before the institution of baptism, had\ncircumcision instead of it, let us examine the similarity and difference\nbetween these two signs, in order to discover how far we may argue from\none to the other. When the Lord gave Abraham the command of\ncircumcision, he prefaced it by saying, “I will be a God unto thee, and\nto thy seed after thee;” at the same time declaring himself to be\n“Almighty,” having an abundance of all things at his disposal, that\nAbraham might expect to find his hand the source of every\nblessing.[1165] These words contain the promise of eternal life,\naccording to the interpretation of Christ, who deduces from this\ndeclaration an argument to evince the immortality and resurrection of\nbelievers. “For God,” says he, “is not the God of the dead, but of the\nliving.”[1166] Wherefore also Paul, in showing the Ephesians from what\nmisery the Lord had delivered them, concludes, from their not having\nbeen admitted to the covenant of circumcision, that “at that time” they\n“were without Christ, strangers from the covenants of promise, having no\nhope and without God;”[1167] all these things being comprehended in that\ncovenant. But the first access to God, the first entrance into immortal\nlife, is the remission of sins. Whence it follows that this promise\ncorresponds with the promise of baptism respecting our purgation. The\nLord afterwards stipulated with Abraham, that he should walk before him\nin sincerity and purity of heart: this belongs to mortification, or\nregeneration. And to preclude any doubt that circumcision is a sign of\nmortification, Moses more expressly declares it in another place, when\nhe exhorts the Israelites to circumcise their hearts, because the Lord\nhad chosen them for himself above all the nations of the earth. As God,\nwhen he adopts the posterity of Abraham to be his people, commands them\nto be circumcised, so Moses pronounces it to be necessary to circumcise\nthe heart, thereby declaring the true signification of that carnal\ncircumcision.[1168] Then, that no one might attempt this in his own\nstrength, he teaches that it is the work of Divine grace.[1169] All\nthese things are so often inculcated by the prophets, that there is no\nneed to collect here the numerous testimonies which every where present\nthemselves. We have ascertained, therefore, that a spiritual promise,\nthe very same which is given to us in baptism, was given to the fathers\nin circumcision; which represented to them the remission of sins and the\nmortification of the flesh. Moreover, as we have shown that Christ, in\nwhom both these things are obtained, is the foundation of baptism, the\nsame must be evident of circumcision. For he was promised to Abraham,\nand in him the blessing of all nations; and the sign of circumcision was\nadded in confirmation of this grace.\nIV. There is now no difficulty in discovering what similarity or what\ndifference there is between these two signs. The promise, in which we\nhave stated the virtue of the signs to consist, is the same in both;\nincluding the paternal favour of God, remission of sins, and eternal\nlife. In the next place, the thing signified also is one and the same,\nnamely, regeneration. The foundation, on which the accomplishment of\nthese things rests, is the same in both. Wherefore there is no\ndifference in the internal mystery, by which all the force and peculiar\nnature of sacraments must be determined. All the difference lies in the\nexternal ceremony, which is the smallest portion of it; whereas the\nprincipal part depends on the promise and the thing signified. We may\nconclude, therefore, that whatever belongs to circumcision, except the\ndifference of the visible ceremony, belongs also to baptism. To this\ninference and comparison we are led by the apostle’s rule, which directs\nus to examine every interpretation of Scripture by the proportion of\nfaith.[1170] And, indeed, the truth on this subject is obvious to the\nslightest observation. For as circumcision was a pledge to the Jews, by\nwhich they were assured of their adoption as the people and family of\nGod, and on their parts professed their entire subjection to him, and\ntherefore was their first entrance into the Church, so now we are\ninitiated into the Church of God by baptism, are numbered among his\npeople, and profess to devote ourselves to his service. Hence it is\nevident, beyond all controversy, that baptism has succeeded in the place\nof circumcision.\nV. Now, if it be inquired, whether baptism may rightly be administered\nto infants, shall we not pronounce it an excess of folly, and even\nmadness, in any one who resolves to dwell entirely on the element of\nwater and the external observance, and cannot bear to direct his\nthoughts to the spiritual mystery; a due consideration of which will\nprove, beyond all doubt, that baptism is justly administered to infants,\nas that to which they are fully entitled? For the Lord, in former ages,\ndid not favour them with circumcision without making them partakers of\nall those things which were then signified by circumcision. Otherwise,\nhe must have deluded his people with mere impostures, if he deceived\nthem by fallacious symbols; which it is dreadful even to hear. For he\nexpressly pronounces that the circumcision of a little infant should\nserve as a seal for the confirmation of the covenant. But if the\ncovenant remains firm and unmoved, it belongs to the children of\nChristians now, as much as it did to the infants of the Jews under the\nOld Testament. But if they are partakers of the thing signified, why\nshall they be excluded from the sign? If they obtain the truth, why\nshall they be debarred from the figure? Though the external sign in the\nsacrament is so connected with the word, as not to be separated from it,\nyet if it be distinguished, which shall we esteem of the greater\nimportance? Certainly, when we see that the sign is subservient to the\nword, we shall pronounce it to be inferior to it, and assign it the\nsubordinate place. While the word of baptism, then, is directed to\ninfants, why shall the sign, which is an appendix to the word, be\nprohibited to them? This one reason, if there were no others, would be\nabundantly sufficient for the refutation of all opposers. The objection\nthat there was a particular day fixed for circumcision, is a mere\nevasion. We admit that we are not now bound to certain days, like the\nJews; but when the Lord, though he prescribes no particular day, yet\ndeclares it to be his pleasure that infants shall be received into his\ncovenant by a solemn rite, what do we want more?\nVI. The Scripture, however, still affords a more certain knowledge of\nthe truth. For it is most evident that the covenant which the Lord once\nmade with Abraham continues as much in force with Christians in the\npresent day, as it did formerly with the Jews; and consequently that\nthat word is no less applicable to Christians than it was to the Jews.\nUnless we suppose that Christ by his advent diminished or curtailed the\ngrace of the Father; which is execrable blasphemy. Wherefore the\nchildren of the Jews, because they were made heirs of that covenant, and\ndistinguished from the children of the impious, were called a holy seed;\nand for the same reason, the children of Christians, even when only one\nof the parents is pious, are accounted holy, and according to the\ntestimony of the apostle, differ from the impure seed of idolaters. Now,\nas the Lord, immediately after having made the covenant with Abraham,\ncommanded it to be sealed in infants by an external sacrament, what\ncause will Christians assign why they should not also at this day\ntestify and seal the same in their children? Nor let it be objected,\nthat the Lord commanded not his covenant to be confirmed by any other\nsymbol than that of circumcision, which has long ago been abolished. For\nit is easy to reply, that during the time of the Old Testament he\nappointed circumcision for the confirmation of his covenant; but that\nsince the abrogation of circumcision, there always remains the same\nreason for confirming it, which we have in common with the Jews. It is\nnecessary, therefore, to be careful in observing what we have in common\nwith them, and what they had different from us. The covenant is common,\nthe reason for confirming it is common. Only the mode of confirmation is\ndifferent; for to them it was confirmed by circumcision, which among us\nhas been succeeded by baptism. Otherwise, if the testimony by which the\nJews were assured of the salvation of their seed be taken away from us,\nthe effect of the advent of Christ has been to render the grace of God\nmore obscure and less attested to us than it was to the Jews. If this\ncannot be affirmed without great dishonour to Christ, by whom the\ninfinite goodness of God has been diffused over the earth, and\nmanifested to men in a more conspicuous and liberal manner than at any\nformer period, we must be obliged to confess, that at least it ought not\nto be more concealed or less attested than under the obscure shadows of\nthe law.\nVII. Wherefore the Lord Jesus, to exhibit a specimen from which the\nworld might understand that he was come to extend rather than to limit\nthe mercy of the Father, kindly received the infants that were presented\nto him, and embraced them in his arms, chiding his disciples who\nendeavoured to forbid their approach to him, because they would keep\nthose, of whom was the kingdom of heaven, at a distance from him who is\nthe only way of entrance into it. But some will object, What resemblance\ndoes this embrace of Christ bear to baptism? for he is not said to have\nbaptized them, but to have received them, taken them in his arms, and\nblessed them; therefore, if we desire to imitate his example, let us\nassist infants with our prayers, but let us not baptize them. But it is\nnecessary to consider the conduct of Christ with more attention than it\nreceives from persons of this class. For it is not to be passed over as\na thing of little importance, that Christ commanded infants to be\nbrought to him, and added, as a reason for this command, “For of such is\nthe kingdom of heaven;” and afterwards gave a practical testimony of his\nwill, when, embracing them in his arms, he commended them to his Father\nby his prayers and benedictions. If it be reasonable for infants to be\nbrought to Christ, why is it not allowable to admit them to baptism, the\nsymbol of our communion and fellowship with Christ? If of them is the\nkingdom of heaven, why shall they be denied the sign, which opens, as it\nwere, an entrance into the Church, that, being received into it, they\nmay be enrolled among the heirs of the heavenly kingdom? How unjust\nshall we be, if we drive away from Christ those whom he invites to him;\nif we deprive them of the gifts with which he adorns them; if we exclude\nthose whom he freely admits! But if we examine how far what Christ did\non that occasion differs from baptism, how much greater importance shall\nwe attach to baptism, by which we testify that infants are included in\nthe covenant of God, than to the reception, the embrace, the imposition\nof hands, and the prayers by which Jesus Christ himself acknowledged\nthem as his, and declared them to be sanctified by him! The other cavils\nby which our opponents endeavour to elude the force of this passage,\nonly betray their ignorance. For they argue that as Christ said, “Suffer\nlittle children to _come_,” they must have been grown to such an age and\nstature as to be capable of walking. But they are called by the\nevangelists Βρεφη; and παιδια, two words used by the Greeks to signify\nlittle infants hanging on the breast. The word “_come_,” therefore, is\nmerely used to denote “_access_.” To such evasions are persons obliged\nto have recourse, who resist the truth. Nor is there any more solidity\nin the objection, that the kingdom of heaven is not said to belong to\ninfants, but to those who resemble them, because the expression is, not\nof _them_, but “of _such_ is the kingdom of heaven.” For if this be\nadmitted, what kind of reason would it be that Christ assigns, with a\nview to show that infants in age ought not to be prevented from\napproaching him, when he says, “Suffer little children to come unto me?”\nNothing can be plainer than that he intends those who are in a state of\nreal infancy. And to prevent this from being thought unreasonable, he\nadds, “Of such is the kingdom of heaven.” And if infants be necessarily\ncomprehended, it is beyond all doubt that the word “_such_” designates\nboth infants themselves and those who resemble them.[1171]\nVIII. Now, every one must perceive, that the baptism of infants, which\nis so strongly supported by the authority of Scripture, is very far from\nbeing an invention of men. Nor is there much plausibility in the\nobjection, that it is nowhere stated that even a single infant was\nbaptized by the hands of the apostles. For though no such circumstance\nis expressly mentioned by the evangelists, yet, on the other hand, as\nthey are never excluded when mention happens to be made of the baptism\nof any family, who can rationally conclude from this, that they were not\nbaptized? If there were any force in such arguments, women might as well\nbe interdicted from the Lord’s supper, because we have no account of\ntheir having been admitted to it in the days of the apostles. But in\nthis we are content with the rule of faith. For when we consider the\ndesign of the institution of the Lord’s supper, the conclusion is easy\nrespecting the persons who ought to be admitted to a participation of\nit. We observe the same rule also in the case of baptism. For when we\nconsider the end of its institution, we evidently perceive that it\nbelongs to infants as well as to adults. Therefore they cannot be\ndeprived of it without a manifest evasion of the will of the Divine\nAuthor. What they circulate among the uninformed multitude, that after\nthe resurrection of Christ, a long series of years passed, in which\ninfant baptism was unknown, is shamefully contrary to truth; for there\nis no ancient writer who does not refer its origin, as a matter of\ncertainty, to the age of the apostles.\nIX. It remains for us briefly to show what advantage results from this\nceremony, both to believers who present their children to the Church to\nbe baptized, and to the infants themselves who are washed in the holy\nwater; to guard it from being despised as useless or unimportant. But if\nany man takes it into his head to ridicule infant baptism on this\npretext, he holds the command of circumcision, which was given by the\nLord, in equal contempt. For what will they allege to impugn the baptism\nof infants, which may not be retorted against circumcision? Thus the\nLord avenges the arrogance of those, who forthwith condemn what their\ncarnal sense does not comprehend. But God furnishes us with other\nweapons to repel their folly; nor does this sacred ordinance of his\nappointment, which we experience to be a source of peculiar support and\nconsolation to our faith, deserve to be called unnecessary. For this\nsign of God, communicated to a child, like the impress of a seal,\nratifies and confirms the promise given to the pious parent, declaring\nthat the Lord will be a God, not only to him, but also to his seed, and\nthat he is determined to exercise his goodness and grace, not only\ntowards him, but towards his posterity even to a thousand generations.\nThe manifestation here given of the mercy of God, in the first place,\nfurnishes the most abundant matter for the celebration of his glory; and\nin the second place, fills pious breasts with more than common joy, by\nwhich they are excited to a more ardent return of affection to such an\nindulgent Father, in whom they discover such care of their posterity on\ntheir account. Nor shall I regard an objection, if it should be urged,\nthat the mere promise of God ought to be sufficient to assure us of the\nsalvation of our children; since God, who knows our weakness, and has\nbeen pleased in this instance to indulge it, has decided otherwise. Let\nthose, therefore, who embrace the promise of God that he will perpetuate\nhis mercy to their offspring, consider it their duty to present them to\nthe Church to be signed with the symbol of mercy, and thereby to animate\ntheir minds to stronger confidence, when they actually see the covenant\nof the Lord engraven on the bodies of their children. The children also\nreceive some advantage from their baptism, their ingrafting into the\nbody of the Church being a more peculiar recommendation of them to the\nother members; and afterwards, when they grow to years of maturity, it\noperates upon them as a powerful stimulus to a serious attention to the\nworship of God, by whom they were accepted as his children by the solemn\nsymbol of adoption, before they were capable of knowing him as their\nFather. Finally, we ought to be alarmed by the vengeance which God\nthreatens to inflict, if any one disdains to mark his son with the\nsymbol of the covenant; for the contempt of that symbol involves the\nrejection and abjuration of the grace which it presents.\nX. Let us now discuss the arguments with which some violent disputants\ncontinue to impugn this holy institution of God. In the first place,\nfinding themselves very hardly pressed and exceedingly embarrassed by\nthe similarity of baptism and circumcision, they labour to establish a\nconsiderable difference between these two signs, that one may appear to\nhave nothing in common with the other. For they affirm, first, that\ndifferent things are signified; secondly, that the covenant is entirely\ndifferent; and thirdly, that the children are mentioned in a different\nmanner. But when they endeavour to prove the first point, they allege\nthat circumcision was a figure of mortification, and not of baptism;\nwhich we most readily grant, for it is an excellent argument in our\nfavour. We urge no other proof of our sentiment, than that baptism and\ncircumcision are equally signs of mortification. Hence we conclude, that\nbaptism was introduced in the place of circumcision, and represents to\nus the very same thing which that formerly did to the Jews. In asserting\na difference of the covenant, with what presumption and absurdity do\nthey corrupt the Scripture, and that not in a single passage, but\nwithout leaving any part of it secure from their perversions. For they\nrepresent the carnality of the Jews to be such, as to give them a\ngreater resemblance to brutes than to rational beings; contending that\nthe covenant made with them was limited to a temporary life, and that\nthe promises given to them were all confined to present and corporeal\nenjoyments. If this notion be admitted, what remains but to consider the\nJewish people as pampered for a season by the Divine bounty, (like a\nherd of swine, fattened in a sty,) to perish at length in eternal ruin?\nFor whenever we adduce circumcision and the promises annexed to it, they\nreply, that circumcision was a literal sign, and that the promises\nconnected with it were all carnal.\nXI. Certainly, if circumcision was a literal sign, the same opinion must\nbe formed of baptism; for the apostle makes one no more spiritual than\nthe other. He says to the Colossians, “In Christ ye are circumcised with\nthe circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins\nof the flesh;” and this he calls “the circumcision of Christ.” In\nexplication of this sentiment, he adds, that they were “buried with\nChrist in baptism.”[1172] What is the meaning of this language, but that\nthe accomplishment and truth of baptism is the same with the\naccomplishment and truth of circumcision, since they both represent the\nsame thing? For his design is to show that baptism was to Christians the\nsame that circumcision had before been to the Jews. But as we have now\nclearly evinced that the promises of these two signs, and the mysteries\nrepresented by them, are precisely the same, we shall insist no longer\non this point at present. I will only recommend believers to consider,\nwhether that sign ought to be accounted earthly and literal, which\ncontains nothing but what is spiritual and heavenly. But to guard the\nsimple against their fallacies, we shall briefly reply by the way to one\nobjection, by which they endeavour to support this shameful\nmisrepresentation. It is very certain that the principal promises of the\ncovenant, which God made with the Israelites under the Old Testament,\nwere spiritual, and had reference to eternal life; and that they were\nalso understood by the fathers, as they ought to be, in a spiritual\nsense, and inspired them with confident hopes of the life to come,\ntowards which they aspired with all the powers of their souls. At the\nsame time, we are far from denying that he testified his benevolence to\nthem by terrestrial and carnal advantages, by which we also maintain\nthat their hopes of spiritual promises were confirmed. Thus, when he\npromised eternal blessedness to his servant Abraham, he added, in order\nto set a manifest token of his favour before his eyes, another promise\nrespecting the possession of the land of Canaan. In this manner we ought\nto understand all the terrestrial promises which were given to the\nJewish nation; so that the spiritual promise may always be considered as\na source and foundation, to which the others may be referred. But having\ntreated these points more at large in discussing the difference of the\nOld and New Testaments, I touch the more slightly upon them here.\nXII. In the mention of the children they find this variety; that under\nthe Old Testament, those were called the children of Abraham, who\nderived their natural descent from him; but that now this appellation is\ngiven to those who imitate his faith; and that, therefore, that carnal\ninfancy, which was ingrafted into the fellowship of the Church by\ncircumcision, prefigured those spiritual infants of the New Testament,\nwho by the word of God are regenerated to an immortal life. In this\nlanguage we discover, indeed, a small spark of truth; but it is a great\nerror of these persons, that while they lay hold of whatever first comes\nto their hands, when they ought to pursue it much further, and to\ncompare many things together, they pertinaciously insist on a single\nword; hence it necessarily happens that they are often deceived, because\nthey acquire no solid knowledge of any thing. We confess that the\nnatural seed of Abraham did for a time hold the place of those spiritual\nchildren which are incorporated with him by faith. For we are called his\nchildren, notwithstanding there is no natural relationship between him\nand us. But if they understand, as they certainly do, that no spiritual\nblessing was ever promised by God to the carnal seed of Abraham, they\nare greatly deceived. It behoves us to aim at a more correct sentiment,\nto which we are directed by the certain guidance of the Scripture. The\nLord, therefore, promised to Abraham, that he should have a Seed, in\nwhom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed, and accompanied\nthis promise with an assurance that he would be a God to him, and to his\nseed. All those, who by faith receive Christ, the Author of the\nblessing, are heirs of this promise, and are therefore denominated\n“children of Abraham.”\nXIII. Though, after the resurrection of Christ, the boundaries of the\nkingdom of God began to be extended far and wide into all nations,\nwithout any distinction, that, according to the declaration of Christ,\nbelievers might be collected “from the east, and from the west, and\nfrom the north, and from the south,” to “sit down with Abraham, and\nIsaac, and Jacob,”[1173] in the glory of heaven, yet he had embraced\nthe Jews with this great mercy for many ages before; and because he\nhad passed by all others, and selected this one nation, to be for a\nseason the exclusive objects of his grace, he called them his\n“peculiar treasure” and “special people.”[1174] In attestation of this\nbeneficence, the Lord gave them circumcision, which was a sign to\nteach the Jews that he would be their defence and salvation; and the\nknowledge of this inspired their hearts with the hope of eternal life.\nFor what can be wanting to them whom God has taken into his charge?\nWherefore the apostle, with a view to prove that the Gentiles are\nchildren of Abraham as well as the Jews, expresses himself in the\nfollowing manner: “Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness in\nuncircumcision. And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of\nthe righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised;\nthat he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be\nnot circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also;\nand the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision\nonly, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father\nAbraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.”[1175] Do not we see\nthat equal dignity is attributed to Jews and Gentiles? For during the\ntime fixed by the decree of God, Abraham was the father of\ncircumcision. When the “middle wall of partition between” them was\n“broken down,”[1176] as the apostle says in another place, to give the\nGentiles an entrance into the kingdom of God, he became also their\nfather, and that without the sign of circumcision; for instead of\ncircumcision, they have baptism. The express intimation, that Abraham\nwas not a father to them who were of the circumcision only, was\nintroduced by the apostle, to repress the vain confidence of some who\nneglected all concern about piety, and prided themselves in mere\nceremonies. In the same manner, we may now refute the vanity of those\nwho in baptism never carry their thoughts beyond the water.\nXIV. But in objection to this, another passage is adduced from the same\napostle, in which he states, “that they which are the children of the\nflesh” are not “the children of Abraham,” but that only “the children of\nthe promise are counted for the seed.”[1177] For this passage seems to\nimply, that carnal descent from Abraham is nothing, though we attribute\nsome importance to it. But it is requisite to pay more particular\nattention to the subject which the apostle is here discussing. For in\norder to show to the Jews, that the goodness of God was not confined to\nthe seed of Abraham, and even that carnal descent from him was of no\nvalue in itself, he alleges, in proof of it, the cases of Ishmael and\nEsau; who, notwithstanding they were the true offspring of Abraham\naccording to the flesh, were rejected as if they had been strangers, and\nthe blessing remained with Isaac and Jacob. Hence follows what he\nafterwards affirms—that salvation depends on the mercy of God, which he\nimparts to whom he pleases; but that the Jews have no reason for\nsatisfaction, or glorying in the name of the covenant, unless they\nobserve the law of the covenant; that is, obey the Divine word. Yet,\nafter having demolished their vain confidence in their descent, knowing,\non the other hand, that the covenant which God had once made with the\nposterity of Abraham could by no means be invalidated, he argues, that\nthe natural descendants are not to be deprived of their dignity; by\nvirtue of which he shows that the Jews were the first and natural heirs\nof the gospel, only that they had been rejected as unworthy, on account\nof their ingratitude, yet that the heavenly benediction had not entirely\ndeparted from their nation. For which reason, though they were rebels\nand violators of the covenant, yet he calls them holy; such high honours\ndoes he give to the holy generation, which God honoured with his sacred\ncovenant; but he considers us, in comparison with them, as the\nposthumous, and even abortive children of Abraham, and that not by\nnature, but by adoption; as if a branch broken off from its native tree\nwere ingrafted on another stock. That they might not be defrauded of\ntheir prerogative, therefore, it was necessary for the gospel to be\nfirst announced to them; for they are, as it were, the first-born in the\nfamily of God. Wherefore this honour was to be given to them, till they\nrejected the offer of it, and by their ingratitude caused it to be\ntransferred to the Gentiles. Nor, whatever be the obstinacy with which\nthey persist in opposing the gospel, ought they, on that account, to be\ndespised by us, if we consider that, for the sake of the promise, the\nblessing of God still remains among them; as the apostle clearly\ntestifies that it will never entirely depart from them; “for the gifts\nand calling of God are without repentance.”[1178]\nXV. See, now, the importance and the estimate to be formed of the\npromise given to the posterity of Abraham. Therefore, though we have no\ndoubt that the distinction of the heirs of the kingdom from those who\nhave no share in it, is the free act of the sovereign election of God,\nyet, at the same time, we perceive that he has been pleased to display\nhis mercy in a peculiar manner on the seed of Abraham, and to testify\nand seal it by circumcision. The same reason is applicable to the\nChristian Church. For as Paul, in that passage, argues that the children\nof the Jews were sanctified by their parents, so, in another\nplace,[1179] he teaches that the children of Christians derive the same\nsanctification from their parents; whence it is inferred, that they who,\non the contrary, are condemned as impure, are deservedly separated from\nothers. Now, who can doubt the falsehood of the consequence attempted to\nbe established, that the infants who were circumcised in former ages,\nonly prefigured those who are infants in a spiritual sense, being\nregenerated by the word of God? Paul does not reason in this manner,\nwhen he says, “that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for\nthe truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers;”[1180]\nas if he had said, Since the covenant made with Abraham relates to his\nseed, Jesus Christ, in order to execute and discharge the promise once\npledged by the Father, came to save the people of the Jews. We see how,\neven after the resurrection of Christ, Paul understands that the promise\nof the covenant is to be fulfilled, not only in an allegorical sense,\nbut, according to the literal import of the words, to the natural seed\nof Abraham. To the same effect is the declaration of Peter to the Jews,\n“The promise is unto you and to your children,”[1181] and the\nappellation under which he addresses them, “Ye are the children of the\ncovenant,”[1182] and if children, then heirs. A similar sentiment is\nconveyed in another passage of the apostle, which we have already\nquoted, where he represents the circumcision performed on infants as a\ntestimony of the communion which they have with Christ.[1183] And, on\nthe contrary principle, what will become of that promise, by which the\nLord, in the second precept of his law, declares to his servants, that\nhe will be merciful to their seed, even to a thousand generations?[1184]\nShall we here have recourse to allegories? That would be a frivolous\nevasion. Shall we say that this promise is cancelled? That would be\nsubversive of the law, which, on the contrary, Christ came to establish,\nas a rule, for a holy life. It ought to be admitted, therefore, beyond\nall controversy, that God is so kind and liberal to his servants, as,\nfor their sakes, to appoint even the children who shall descend from\nthem to be enrolled among his people.\nXVI. The other differences which they endeavour to establish between\nbaptism and circumcision, are not only ridiculous, and destitute of\nevery appearance of reason, but are even repugnant to each other. For\nafter they have affirmed that baptism belongs to the first day of the\nspiritual conflict, but circumcision to the eighth, when the\nmortification is already completed,—immediately forgetting this, they\nchange their story, and call circumcision a sign of the mortification of\nthe flesh, and baptism a symbol of a burial, to which none are to be\nconsigned but those who are already dead. Where can we find another\ninstance of such levity of self-contradiction? For, according to the\nfirst proposition, baptism ought to precede circumcision; according to\nthe second, it ought to follow it. Yet it is not a new thing for the\nminds of men to run into such inconsistencies, when they prefer their\nown dreams to the unerring word of God. We say, therefore, that the\nfirst of these differences is a mere dream. If they wished to allegorize\non the eighth day, yet there was no propriety in this manner of doing\nit. It would have been much better to follow the ancients, and refer the\nnumber of the day either to the resurrection of Christ, which took place\non the eighth day, and on which we know that newness of life depends; or\nto the whole course of the present life, which ought to be a course of\nprogressive mortification, till, at the termination of life, the\nmortification also should be completed. It is probable, however, that\nGod deferred circumcision to the eighth day on account of the tenderness\nof young infants, whose lives might be endangered by the performance of\nthat rite immediately on their birth. Nor is there much more solidity in\nthe second position, that, after being dead, we are buried by baptism;\nsince the Scripture expressly teaches, that “we are buried by baptism\ninto death,”[1185] in order to our entrance on a course of\nmortification, and continuance in it from that time forward! Nor is\nthere any more propriety in the objection, that, if it be necessary to\nconform baptism to circumcision, women ought not to be baptized. For if\nit be evident, that the sign of circumcision testified the\nsanctification of the seed of Israel, there can be no doubt that it was\ngiven equally for the sanctification of males and females. And though\nonly the males were circumcised, they alone being capable of it, the\nfemales were in a certain sense partakers of their circumcision.\nDismissing such follies, therefore, let us never forget the similarity\nof baptism and circumcision, between which we discover a complete\nagreement in the internal mystery, the promises, the use, and the\nefficacy.\nXVII. They consider themselves as advancing a most powerful argument for\nexcluding infants from baptism, when they allege, that by reason of\ntheir age they are not yet capable of understanding the mystery\nsignified in it; that is, spiritual regeneration, which cannot take\nplace in early infancy. Therefore they conclude, they are to be\nconsidered in no other view than as children of Adam, till they have\nattained an age which admits of a second birth. But all these things are\nuniformly contradicted by the truth of God. For if they must be left\namong the children of Adam, they are left in death; for in Adam we can\nonly die. On the contrary, Christ commands them to be brought to him.\nWhy? Because he is life. To give them life, therefore, he makes them\npartakers of himself; while these men, by driving them away from him,\nadjudge them to death. For if they pretend that infants do not perish,\neven though they are considered as children of Adam, their error is\nabundantly refuted by the testimony of Scripture. For when it pronounces\nthat “in Adam all die,”[1186] it follows that there remains no hope of\nlife but in Christ. In order to become heirs of life, therefore, it is\nnecessary for us to be partakers of him. So, when it is said, in other\nplaces, that we are “by nature the children of wrath,”[1187] and\n“conceived in sin,”[1188] with which condemnation is always connected,\nit follows, that we must depart from our own nature, to have any\nadmission to the kingdom of God. And what can be more explicit than this\ndeclaration, “that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of\nGod?”[1189] Let every thing of our own, therefore, be destroyed, which\nwill not be effected without regeneration, and then we shall see this\npossession of the kingdom. Lastly, if Christ speaks the truth, when he\ndeclares himself to be “life,”[1190] it is necessary for us to be\ningrafted into him, that we may be rescued from the bondage of death.\nBut how, it is inquired, are infants regenerated, who have no knowledge\neither of good or evil? We reply, that the work of God is not yet\nwithout existence, because it is not observed or understood by us. Now,\nit is certain that some infants are saved; and that they are previously\nregenerated by the Lord, is beyond all doubt. For if they are born in a\nstate of corruption, it is necessary for them to be purified before they\nare admitted into the kingdom of God, into which “there shall in no wise\nenter any thing that defileth.”[1191] If they are born sinners, as both\nDavid and Paul affirm, either they must remain unacceptable and hateful\nto God, or it is necessary for them to be justified. And what do we\nrequire more, when the Judge himself declares that there is no entrance\ninto the heavenly life, except for those who are born again?[1192] And,\nto silence all objectors, by sanctifying John the Baptist in his\nmother’s womb, he exhibited an example of what he was able to do for\nothers. Nor can they gain any advantage by their frivolous evasion, that\nthis was only a single case, which does not justify the conclusion that\nthe Lord generally acts in this manner with infants. For we use no such\nargument. We only mean to show, that they unjustly confine the power of\nGod within those narrow limits to which it does not suffer itself to be\nrestricted. Their other subterfuge is equally weak. They allege that,\naccording to the usage of the Scripture, the phrase _from the womb_\ndenotes _from childhood_. But it is easy to see that, in the declaration\nof the angel to Zacharias, it was used in a different sense, and that\nJohn was to be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before he was\nborn.[1193] Let us not attempt, therefore, to impose laws upon God,\nwhose power has sustained no diminution, but who is able to sanctify\nwhom he pleases, as he sanctified this child.\nXVIII. And for this reason, Christ was sanctified from his earliest\ninfancy, that he might sanctify in himself all his elect, of every age,\nwithout any difference. For as, in order to obliterate the guilt of the\ntransgression which had been perpetrated in our flesh, he assumed to\nhimself that very flesh, that he might perform a perfect obedience in\nit, on our account, and in our stead, so he was conceived of the Holy\nSpirit, that, having the whole body which he assumed, fully endued with\nthe sanctity of the Spirit, he might communicate the same to us. If\nChrist exhibits a perfect exemplar of all the graces which God bestows\nupon his children, he will also furnish us with a proof, that the age of\ninfancy is not altogether incompatible with sanctification. But, however\nthis may be, we consider it as clear, beyond all controversy, that not\none of the elect is called out of the present life, without having been\npreviously regenerated and sanctified by the Spirit of God. Their\nobjection, that the Holy Spirit, in the Scriptures, acknowledges no\nregeneration, except from “the incorruptible seed,” that is, “the word\nof God,”[1194] is a misinterpretation of that passage of Peter, which\nmerely comprehends believers who had been taught by the preaching of the\ngospel. To such persons, indeed, we grant that the word of the Lord is\nthe only seed of spiritual regeneration; but we deny that it ought to be\nconcluded from this, that infants cannot be regenerated by the power of\nGod, which is as easy to him as it is wonderful and mysterious to us.\nBesides, it would not be safe to affirm, that the Lord cannot reveal\nhimself in any way so as to make himself known to them.\nXIX. But our opponents say, “Faith cometh by hearing,”[1195] of which\nthey have not yet acquired the use, and they cannot be capable of\nknowing God; for Moses declares them to “have no knowledge between good\nand evil.”[1196] But they do not consider, that when the apostle makes\nhearing the source of faith, he only describes the ordinary economy and\ndispensation of the Lord, which he generally observes in the calling of\nhis people; but does not prescribe a perpetual rule for him, precluding\nhis employment of any other method; which he has certainly employed in\nthe calling of many, to whom he has given the true knowledge of himself\nin an internal manner, by the illumination of his Spirit, without the\nintervention of any preaching. But as they think it would be such a\ngreat absurdity for any knowledge of God to be given to infants, to whom\nMoses denies the knowledge of good and evil, I would beg them to inform\nme, what danger can result from our affirming that they already receive\nsome portion of that grace, of which they will ere long enjoy the full\nabundance. For if the plenitude of life consists in the perfect\nknowledge of God,—when some of them, whom death removes from the present\nstate in their earliest infancy, pass into eternal life, they are\ncertainly admitted to the immediate contemplation of the presence of\nGod. As the Lord, therefore, will illuminate them with the full\nsplendour of his countenance in heaven, why may he not also, if such be\nhis pleasure, irradiate them with some faint rays of it in the present\nlife; especially if he does not deliver them from all ignorance before\nhe liberates them from the prison of the body? Not that I would hastily\naffirm them to be endued with the same faith which we experience in\nourselves, or at all to possess a similar knowledge of faith, which I\nwould prefer leaving in suspense; my design is only to check their\nfoolish arrogance, who presumptuously assert or deny whatever they\nplease.\nXX. To strengthen their cause still further, our opponents proceed to\nallege, that baptism is a sacrament of repentance and faith; and that,\ntherefore, as neither of these can be exercised in infancy, infants\nought not to be admitted to a participation of baptism, the\nsignification of which would thereby be rendered vain. But these\narguments are directed against God, more than against us. For it is very\nevident, from many testimonies of Scripture, that circumcision also was\na sign of repentance, and Paul calls it “a seal of the righteousness of\nfaith.”[1197] Let the reason, then, be demanded of God himself, why he\ncommanded it to be impressed on the bodies of infants. For, as baptism\nand circumcision both stand on the same ground, they can attribute\nnothing to the latter which they must not also grant to the former. If\nthey recur to their favourite subterfuge, that the age of infancy then\nprefigured spiritual infants, it has been already answered. We say,\ntherefore, that since God formerly communicated to infants the rite of\ncircumcision, which was a sacrament of repentance and faith, it appears\nto be no absurdity for them now to be admitted to a participation of\nbaptism; unless these men wish to offer a direct insult to the\ninstitution of God. But in this, as well as in all the proceedings of\nGod, his wisdom and righteousness are sufficiently conspicuous to\nrepress the opposition and detraction of the impious. For though\ninfants, at the time of their circumcision, did not understand the\nmeaning of that sign, they were nevertheless truly circumcised into the\nmortification of their corrupt and polluted nature, which they were to\npursue in mature years. In short, this objection may be answered without\nany difficulty, by saying that they are baptized into future repentance\nand faith; for though these graces have not yet been formed in them, the\nseeds of both are nevertheless implanted in their hearts by the secret\noperation of the Spirit. This answer at once overturns every argument\nthey urge against us, derived from the signification of baptism; as when\nthey allege the designation given it by Paul, where he calls it “the\nwashing of regeneration and renewing;”[1198] whence they argue that it\nought to be given only to such as are capable of being regenerated and\nrenewed. But we may reply, on the other hand, neither was circumcision,\nwhich was a sign of regeneration, to be given to any but such as were\nalready regenerated; and this, in their apprehension, will be to condemn\nthe ordinance of God. Therefore, as we have suggested several times\nbefore, whatever arguments tend equally to invalidate circumcision, can\nhave no force in the controversy against baptism. Nor can they escape\nfrom any difficulty, by saying, that whatever clearly rests on the\nauthority of God, we ought to consider as fixed and determined, though\nwe can discover no reason for it; but that this reverence is not due to\ninfant baptism, or to other similar things, which are not enjoined upon\nus by the express word of God; for they will always be held fast by this\ndilemma. Either the command of God, respecting the circumcision of\ninfants, was legitimate and liable to no objections, or it was deserving\nof censure. If there was no absurdity in that command, neither can any\nabsurdity be detected in the practice of infant baptism.\nXXI. The charge of absurdity, with which they endeavour to stigmatize\nit, we thus refute: If any of those who are the objects of divine\nelection, after having received the sign of regeneration, depart out of\nthis life before they have attained years of discretion, the Lord\nrenovates them by the power of his Spirit, incomprehensible to us, in\nsuch a manner as he alone foresees will be necessary. If they happen to\nlive to an age at which they are capable of being instructed in the true\nsignification of baptism, they will hence be the more inflamed to the\npursuit of that renovation, with the token of which they find themselves\nto have been favoured in their earliest infancy, that it might be the\nobject of their constant attention all their lifetime. In the same sense\nmust be understood what Paul states in two places, that we are “buried\nwith Christ by baptism.”[1199] For he does not mean that he who is to be\nbaptized, must previously be buried with Christ, but simply declares the\ndoctrine which is contained in baptism, and that to persons already\nbaptized; so that it would be unreasonable to argue from those passages,\nthat such burial with Christ must precede baptism. In this manner Moses\nand the prophets reminded the people what was the meaning of\ncircumcision, though they had received that rite when they were infants.\nTo the same effect is what Paul writes to the Galatians, that “as many\nas have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.”[1200] For what\npurpose? Why, that they might thenceforward live to Christ, who had\nnever lived to him before. And though in adults a knowledge of the\nmystery ought to precede the reception of the sign, yet a different rule\nis to be applied to infants, as we shall presently show. Nor can any\nother conclusion be drawn from that passage of Peter, which they\nconsider as decisive in their favour—that baptism is “not the putting\naway of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience\ntoward God, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”[1201] They contend\nthat this passage leaves not the least room for the baptism of infants,\nwho are not capable of that in which the truth of baptism is here stated\nto consist. But they frequently fall into this error, of maintaining\nthat the thing signified should always precede the sign. For the truth\nof circumcision also consisted in the same answer of a good conscience;\nbut if it ought of necessity to precede it, infants would never have\nbeen circumcised by the command of God. But by showing us that the\nanswer of a good conscience is comprehended in the truth of\ncircumcision, and at the same time commanding infants to be circumcised,\nhe sufficiently indicates that it is administered with a view to\nsomething future. Wherefore, all the present efficacy to be required in\nthe baptism of infants, is to ratify and confirm the covenant made with\nthem by the Lord. The remaining signification of this sacrament will\nfollow afterwards, at the time foreseen and appointed by the Lord.\nXXII. It must now, I think, be evident to every person, that all\narguments of this kind are mere perversions of Scripture. Those which\nremain, and are nearly allied to these, we shall run over in a cursory\nmanner. They object, that baptism is given for the remission of sins:\nthis we admit, and it is completely in favour of our opinion. For being\nborn sinners, we need pardon and remission even from our birth. Now, as\nthe Lord does not exclude infants from the hope of mercy, but rather\nassures them of it, why shall we refuse them the sign, which is so far\ninferior to the thing signified? Wherefore, the argument which they urge\nagainst us, we retort upon themselves; infants are favoured with\nremission of sins,—therefore they ought not to be deprived of the sign.\nThey also adduce that passage where the Lord is said to “cleanse the\nChurch with the washing of water by the word.”[1202] But no text could\nbe quoted more conclusive against their error; it furnishes an obvious\nconfirmation of our sentiment. If it be the will of Christ that the\nablution, with which he cleanses his Church, be testified by baptism, it\nappears unreasonable that its testimony should be wanting in infants,\nwho are justly considered as part of the Church, since they are called\nheirs of the kingdom of heaven. For Paul speaks of the whole Church,\nwhen he describes it as cleansed with the washing of water. And, on the\nsame principle, from that passage where he says that we are all baptized\ninto the body of Christ,[1203] we conclude that infants, whom he numbers\namong his members, ought to be baptized, that they may not be separated\nfrom his body. See with what violence, and with what variety of weapons,\nthey attack the bulwarks of our faith!\nXXIII. They proceed, in the next place, to the practice of the apostolic\nage, in which no one is found to have been admitted to baptism without a\nprevious profession of faith and repentance. For in answer to those who\n“were pricked in their heart, and said, What shall we do? Peter said\nunto them,” first, “repent,” and then “be baptized for the remission of\nsins.”[1204] In like manner Philip, when the eunuch requested to be\nbaptized, replied, “If thou believest with all thine heart, thou\nmayest.”[1205] Hence they think themselves justified in concluding, that\nbaptism ought never to be administered to any person without being\npreceded by faith and repentance. But if we adopt this reasoning, the\nfirst of these passages, which makes no mention of faith, will evince\nthe sufficiency of repentance alone: the second, where repentance is not\nrequired, will prove that faith alone is sufficient. I suppose they will\nreply that one passage is elucidated by the other, and that therefore\nthey ought to be connected together. I also contend that other places\nought to be consulted, which may contribute to the solution of this\ndifficulty. For there are many passages of Scripture, the sense of which\ndepends on the circumstances connected with them. This is exemplified in\nthe cases now under consideration. For the persons addressed by Peter\nand Philip were of an age capable of exercising repentance and faith. We\nstrenuously deny that such persons ought to be baptized, without a\nknowledge of their repentance and faith, as far, at least, as they are\ncapable of being ascertained by the judgment of men. But that infants\nought to be ranked in a different class, is sufficiently evident; for,\nunder the former dispensation, if any person connected himself with the\nIsraelites in religious communion, it was necessary for him to be taught\nthe covenant of the Lord, and instructed in the law, before he received\ncircumcision, because he was an alien by birth, not one of the\nIsraelitish people, with whom the covenant, which was confirmed by\ncircumcision, had been made.\nXXIV. So the Lord himself, when he adopts Abraham, does not begin with\ncircumcision, concealing for a time what was intended by that sign; but\nhe first announces the covenant which he designs to make with him, and\nthen, after he has received that promise in faith, makes him a partaker\nof that sacrament. Why does the sacrament follow faith in the case of\nAbraham, and in Isaac, his son, precede all exercise of understanding?\nBecause it is reasonable that a person, who at an adult age is admitted\nto the fellowship of a covenant, to which he had hitherto been a\nstranger, should first learn the conditions of it; but this is not\nnecessary in the case of an infant, who, by hereditary right, according\nto the form of the promise, is already included in the covenant from its\nvery birth. Or, to express it with greater clearness and brevity, if the\nchildren of believers, without the aid of understanding, are partakers\nof the covenant, there is no reason why they should be excluded from the\nsign because they are not capable of expressing their consent to the\nstipulation of the covenant. This is evidently the reason why God\nsometimes declares the children descended from the Israelites to be born\nto himself;[1206] for he undoubtedly considers as his children, the\nchildren of those to whose seed he has promised to be a Father. But he\nwho is an unbeliever, descended from impious parents, is accounted an\nalien from the communion of the covenant, till he be united to God by\nfaith. It is no wonder, therefore, if he be not a partaker of the sign,\nthe signification of which in him would be delusive and vain. In this\nsense Paul tells the Ephesians, that as long as they were immersed in\nidolatry, they were “strangers from the covenant.”[1207] The whole of\nthe subject, if I mistake not, may be clearly and summarily stated in\nthe following position; that persons of adult age, who embrace the\nChristian religion, having been hitherto aliens from the covenant, are\nnot to receive the sign of baptism without the intervention of faith and\nrepentance, which alone can give them an admission to the fellowship of\nthe covenant; but that the infant children of Christian parents, being\nadmitted by God to the inheritance of the covenant as soon as they are\nborn, are also to be admitted to baptism. To this must be referred what\nis related by the evangelists, that the people “were baptized of John,\nconfessing their sins”[1208]—an example which we think ought to be\nfollowed in the present day. For if a Turk or heathen were to offer\nhimself to baptism, we would not hastily admit him to that sacrament,\nwithout his having first made a confession to the satisfaction of the\nChurch.\nXXV. Moreover, they adduce the language of Christ, which is recorded by\nJohn, and which they suppose to represent a present regeneration as\nrequisite to baptism; “Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he\ncannot enter into the kingdom of God.”[1209] See, they say, how baptism\nis called _regeneration_ by the mouth of the Lord. When it is evident,\nthen, that infants are utterly incapable of regeneration, on what\npretence do we admit them to baptism, to which regeneration is\nindispensably necessary? In the first place, they are deceived in\nsupposing that this passage refers to baptism, because it mentions\nwater. For, after Christ had declared to Nicodemus the corruption of\nnature, and shown him the necessity of being born again,—because\nNicodemus was dreaming of a second corporeal birth, he here indicates\nthe manner in which God regenerates us, namely, by water and by the\nSpirit; as if he had said, by the Spirit who, in the ablution and\npurification of the souls of believers, performs the office of water. I\ntherefore understand by “water and the Spirit,” simply, the Spirit who\nis water. Nor is this a novel mode of expression; for it perfectly\ncorresponds with that declaration of John the Baptist, “He that cometh\nafter me shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”[1210] As _to\nbaptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire_, therefore, is to confer the\nHoly Spirit, who, in regeneration, has the office and nature of fire, so\n_to be born of water and of the Spirit_ is no other than to receive that\ninfluence of the Spirit, which does in the soul what water does on the\nbody. I know that others give a different interpretation, but I have no\ndoubt that this is the genuine sense; because the intention of Christ is\nsimply to teach that all must be divested of their own nature, who\naspire to the kingdom of heaven. However, if we were desirous of\nimitating their cavils, it would be easy for us, granting what they\nrequire, to retort upon them, that baptism is prior to faith and\nrepentance, because, in the words of Christ, water is mentioned before\nthe Spirit. It is certain that this phrase denotes spiritual gifts; and,\nif these follow baptism, I have established what I wish. But, leaving\nall subterfuges, let us adhere to the simple interpretation which I have\nproposed—that no one, till he is renewed by living water, that is, by\nthe Spirit, can enter into the kingdom of God.\nXXVI. It is further evident that their notion ought to be exploded,\nbecause it adjudges all unbaptized persons to eternal death. Let us\nsuppose their tenet to be admitted, and baptism to be administered to\nadults alone; what will they say will become of a youth who is rightly\ninstructed in the first principles of piety, if he desires to be\nbaptized, but, contrary to the expectation of all around, happens to be\nsnatched away by sudden death? The Lord’s promise is clear: “Whosoever\nbelieveth on the Son, shall not come into condemnation;” but “is passed\nfrom death unto life.”[1211] We are nowhere informed of his having\ncondemned one who had yet not been baptized. By this I would not be\nunderstood as implying that baptism may be despised with impunity; for,\nso far from attempting to excuse such contempt, I affirm it to be a\nviolation of the covenant of the Lord; I only mean to evince that it is\nnot so necessary, as that a person, who is deprived of the opportunity\nof embracing it, must immediately be considered as lost. But if we\nassent to their notion, we shall condemn all, without exception, whom\nany circumstance whatever prevents from being baptized, whatever faith\nthey may otherwise have, even that faith by which Christ himself is\nenjoyed. Moreover, they sentence all infants to eternal death, by\ndenying them baptism, which, according to their own confession, is\nnecessary to salvation. Let them see, now, how well they agree with the\nlanguage of Christ, which adjudges the kingdom of heaven to little\nchildren. But though we should grant them every thing they contend for\nrelative to the sense of this passage, still they will gain no advantage\nfrom it, unless they first overturn the doctrine which we have already\nestablished respecting the regeneration of infants.\nXXVII. But the strongest argument of all in favour of their opinion,\nthey boast, is contained in the original institution of baptism, which\nthey quote from the last chapter of Matthew, where Christ, sending forth\nhis disciples to all nations, gave them a commission, first to teach,\nand then to baptize. “Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing\nthem in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;\nteaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded\nyou.”[1212] Then, from the last chapter of Mark, they add, “He that\nbelieveth and is baptized shall be saved.”[1213] What more do we\nrequire, say they, when the language of our Lord clearly expresses that\nteaching ought to precede baptism, and represents baptism as subsequent\nto faith? Of this order, an example was furnished even by the Lord Jesus\nhimself who was not baptized till he was “about thirty years of\nage.”[1214] In what various ways do they embarrass themselves, and\nbetray their ignorance! For it is a mistake, worse than childish, to\nconsider that commission as the original institution of baptism, which\nChrist had commanded his apostles to administer from the commencement of\nhis preaching. They have no reason to contend, therefore, that the law\nand rule of baptism ought to be derived from those two passages, as if\nthey contained the first institution of it. Though we should indulge\nthem by admitting this error, yet what force is there in their\nreasoning? Indeed, if we wanted to evade the force of their arguments,\nwe need not have recourse to any little subterfuge; a most ample field\npresents itself before us. For while they so violently insist on the\norder of the words, as to argue, that, when it is said, “Go teach and\nbaptize,” and “he that believeth and is baptized,” the meaning is, that\npreaching ought to precede baptism, and that faith ought to precede the\nreception of baptism,—why may not we, on the other hand, reply, that\nbaptizing ought to precede teaching the observance of those things which\nChrist has commanded, because it is said, “Baptize, teaching them to\nobserve all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” We have remarked\nthe same thing on the declaration of Christ, which has just been quoted,\nrespecting the regeneration of water and of the Spirit; for if it be\nunderstood according to their interpretation, it will appear from that\npassage that baptism is prior to regeneration, because it is mentioned\nfirst: Christ teaches that we must be born again, not of the Spirit and\nof water, but of water and of the Spirit.\nXXVIII. Their invincible bulwark, in which they place such great\nconfidence, seems already somewhat shaken; but as the truth may be\nsufficiently defended by simplicity, I have no inclination to escape\nwith such sophistical and trivial arguments; they shall therefore have a\nsolid reply. The principal command which Christ here gives to his\napostles, is to preach the gospel, to which he subjoins the\nadministration of baptism as an appendage. Besides, he says nothing of\nbaptism, any otherwise than as its administration is subordinate to the\noffice of teaching. For Christ sends his apostles to promulgate the\ngospel to all the nations of the world, that by the doctrine of\nsalvation they may collect, from every land, men who before were lost,\nand introduce them into his kingdom. But what men, or men of what\ndescription? It is certain that there is no mention of any, but those\nwho are capable of receiving instruction. He afterwards adds, that such\npersons, when they have been instructed, are to be baptized, and\nsubjoins a promise: “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.”\nIs there even a single syllable in the whole discourse respecting\ninfants? What kind of argumentation, then, is that with which they\nassail us? Persons of _adult_ age are to be instructed, in order that\nthey may believe before they are to be baptized; _therefore_ it is\nunlawful to administer baptism to _infants_. It will be impossible for\nthem, with all their ingenuity, to prove any thing from this passage,\nexcept that the gospel is first to be preached to those who are capable\nof hearing it, before they are baptized; for it relates to no others.\nLet them raise an obstacle from this, if they can, to exclude infants\nfrom baptism.\nXXIX. But to render their fallacies still more palpable, I will show the\nabsurdity of them by a very plain similitude. The apostle says, “that if\nany would not work, neither should he eat.”[1215] Now, if any man should\npretend to infer from this, that infants ought to be deprived of food,\nwould he not deserve universal contempt? Why so? Because it would be a\nperverse application to all men, indiscriminately, of what was spoken of\nmen of a certain class and a certain age. Nor is there any greater\npropriety in their reasoning in the present case. For what every one\nsees to belong exclusively to persons of adult age, they apply to\ninfants, in order to make them subject to a rule, which was only\nprescribed for persons of riper years. The example of Christ is far from\naffording any support to their cause. He was not baptized till he was\n“about thirty years of age.” That is true indeed; but the reason is\nobvious; because he then intended to lay a solid foundation for baptism\nby his preaching, or rather to establish that which had a little before\nbeen laid by John. Intending, therefore, to institute baptism in his\ndoctrine, in order to conciliate the greater authority to his\ninstitution, he sanctified it in his own body, and that at the point of\ntime which he knew to be most proper, namely, when he was about to\ncommence his ministry. In short, they can prove nothing else from this\ncircumstance, except that baptism derived its origin and commencement\nfrom the preaching of the gospel. If they approve of fixing the\nthirtieth year, why do they not observe it, but admit every one to\nbaptism as soon as he is, in their judgment, sufficiently qualified for\nit? And even Servetus, one of their leaders, though he pertinaciously\ninsisted on this age, yet began to boast of being a prophet himself when\nhe had only attained his twenty-first year. As though it ought to be\ntolerated for a man to arrogate the office of a teacher in the Church\nbefore he is a member of it.\nXXX. At length they object, that there is no more reason why infants\nshould be admitted to baptism than to the Lord’s supper, which, however,\nis not administered to them. As though the Scriptures did not make a\nconsiderable difference between the two cases in every respect. Infant\ncommunion was practised, indeed, in the ancient Church, as appears from\nCyprian and Augustine; but the custom has very properly been\ndiscontinued. For if we consider the nature and property of baptism, we\nfind it to be an entrance or initiation into the Church, by which we are\nenrolled among the people of God—a sign of our spiritual regeneration,\nby which we are born again as the children of God; whereas, on the\ncontrary, the supper is appointed for those of riper years, who, having\npassed the tender state of infancy, are capable of bearing solid meat.\nThis difference is very evidently marked in the Scripture; in which, as\nfar as relates to baptism, the Lord makes no distinction of age, whereas\nhe does not present the supper to the participation of all alike, but\nonly to those who are capable of discerning the body and blood of the\nLord, of examining their own consciences, of showing forth the Lord’s\ndeath, and considering the power of it. Do we wish for any thing plainer\nthan what the apostle inculcates in the following exhortation? “Let a\nman examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that\ncup.”[1216] It must, therefore, be preceded by examination, which would\nin vain be expected from infants. Again: “He that eateth and drinketh\nunworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the\nLord’s body.”[1217] If no persons can be worthy partakers of it, except\nthose who can truly distinguish the holiness of the body of Christ, why\nshould we give to our tender infants poison instead of salutary food?\nWhat is that precept of the Lord, “This do in remembrance of me?”[1218]\nWhat is the inference which the apostle deduces from it? “As often as ye\neat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s death till he\ncome.”[1219] What remembrance, I ask, shall we require from infants of\nthat event, of which they have never attained any knowledge? What\npreaching of the cross of Christ, the virtue and benefit of which their\nminds are not yet capable of comprehending? Not one of these things is\nprescribed in baptism. Between these two signs, therefore, there is a\nconsiderable difference; such as we observe, also, between similar signs\nunder the Old Testament. Circumcision, which is known to correspond to\nour baptism, was destined for infants. The passover, which has now been\nsucceeded by the sacred supper, did not admit guests of all descriptions\npromiscuously, but was rightly eaten only by those who were of\nsufficient age to be able to inquire into its signification. If our\nopponents had a grain of sound sense, would they shut their eyes against\na thing so clear and obvious?\nXXXI. Though I am sorry to burden my readers with such an accumulation\nof reveries, yet it will be worth while to refute the specious arguments\nadduced in this controversy by Servetus, one of the most eminent of the\nAnabaptists, and even the chief glory of that sect. 1. He pretends that\nthe symbols appointed by Christ, as they are perfect, require also those\nwho receive them to be perfect, or persons capable of perfection. But\nthe answer is easy—that the perfection of baptism reaches even unto\ndeath, and cannot with propriety be restricted to one instant of time. I\nobserve, also, that it is foolish to expect a man on the first day to\nattain perfection, towards which baptism invites us to proceed, by\ncontinual advances, as long as we live. 2. He objects, that the symbols\nof Christ were instituted as memorials, that every one may remember that\nhe has been buried with Christ. I answer, that what he has framed from\nhis own head requires no refutation; and that he applies to baptism what\nthe language of Paul shows to be peculiar to the sacred supper, namely,\nthat every one should examine himself; but that nothing like this is any\nwhere said of baptism; from which we conclude, that though, by reason of\ntheir age, infants are not capable of examination, it is nevertheless\nright to baptize them. 3. He adduces the declaration of Christ, that “he\nthat believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God\nabideth on him;”[1220] and concludes that infants, who are incapable of\nbelieving, remain in their condemnation. I answer, that in this passage\nChrist is not speaking of the general guilt in which all the descendants\nof Adam are involved, but only threatening the despisers of the gospel,\nwho proudly and obstinately reject the grace which is offered to them;\nand this has nothing to do with infants. I likewise oppose a contrary\nargument; all those whom Christ blesses are exempted from the curse of\nAdam and the wrath of God; and as it is known that infants were blessed\nby him, it follows that they are exempted from death. He falsely\nalleges, as a passage of Scripture, that “whosoever is born of the\nSpirit heareth the voice of the Spirit;” which, though we were to admit\nas a genuine text, yet he could infer nothing more from it, than that\nbelievers are formed to obedience as the Spirit operates within them.\nBut that which is affirmed of a certain number, it is wrong to apply\nequally to all. 4. He objects, that because “that is first which is\nnatural,”[1221] we ought to wait the proper time for baptism, which is\nspiritual. Now, though I grant that all the descendants of Adam, being\ncarnal, bring their condemnation into the world with them, yet I deny\nthat this is any impediment to the communication of a remedy, as soon as\never God is pleased to impart it. For Servetus can show no Divine\nappointment, that many years shall elapse before the newness of\nspiritual life can begin; for according to the testimony of Paul, though\nthe infant children of believers are in a ruined condition by nature,\nyet they are sanctified by supernatural grace.[1222] 5. He next produces\nan allegory, that when David went up to the fortress of Zion, he took\nwith him neither the blind nor the lame, but hardy soldiers.[1223] And\nwhat if I oppose him with a parable, in which God invites the blind and\nthe lame to the celestial feast?[1224] how will he extricate himself\nfrom this difficulty? I ask, also, whether the blind and the lame had\nnot previously served as soldiers with David. But it is useless to\ninsist longer on this argument, which the readers will discover from the\nsacred history to be founded on mere falsehood. 6. Then follows another\nallegory, that the apostles were “fishers of men,”[1225] not of infants.\nI ask, what is the meaning of that declaration of Christ, that “the\nkingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and\ngathered of every kind?”[1226] But as I am not fond of allegorical\ntrifling, I answer, that when the apostles were appointed to the office\nof teaching, they were not forbidden to baptize infants. I would further\nwish to be informed, since the evangelist uses the word ανθρωπους, (a\nword which comprehends all the human race, without any exception,) why\ninfants should be denied to be ανθρωπους, (human beings.) 7. He\npretends, that as spiritual things belong to spiritual persons,[1227]\ninfants who are not spiritual are not fit subjects of baptism. But here\nit is evident that he is guilty of a gross perversion of that passage of\nPaul, the subject of which relates to doctrine. When the Corinthians\ndiscovered too much complacency in a vain subtlety, the apostle reproved\ntheir stupidity, because they still required to be taught the first\nprinciples of Christian doctrine. Who can infer from this, that baptism\nought to be denied to infants, whom, though they are born of the flesh,\nyet God consecrates to himself by gratuitous adoption? 8. He objects,\nthat if they are new men, they ought to be fed with spiritual food. The\nanswer is easy—that they are admitted into the flock of Christ by\nbaptism, and that the symbol of that adoption is sufficient for them,\ntill they grow to an age capable of bearing solid food; and that it is\ntherefore necessary to wait for the time of that examination, which God\nexpressly requires in the sacred supper. 9. He next objects, that Christ\ninvites all his people to the sacred supper. I answer, it is\nsufficiently clear that he admits none but such as are already prepared\nto celebrate the remembrance of his death. Whence it follows, that\ninfants, whom he condescended to take into his arms, remain in a\ndistinct and peculiar class, till they grow to riper years, and yet that\nthey are not strangers to the Church. To this he objects, that it is a\nmonstrous thing for a person that is born, not to eat. I reply, that the\nexternal participation of the supper is not the only way in which souls\nare fed; and therefore that Christ is food to infants, notwithstanding\nthey abstain from the sign; but that the case of baptism is different,\nby which alone they are admitted into the Church. He further objects,\nthat “a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over\nhis household, giveth them meat in due season.”[1228] This I readily\ngrant; but by what authority will he determine the time of baptism for\nus, so as to prove that it is not administered to infants at a proper\ntime? 10. He likewise adduces the command of Christ to his apostles, to\nhasten to the harvest, while the fields are whitening.[1229] The sole\ndesign of Christ on that occasion was to stimulate the apostles, that,\nseeing the present fruit of their labours, they might exert themselves\nin their ministry with the greater cheerfulness. Who can infer from this\nthat the time of harvest is the only time proper for baptism? 11. His\nnext argument is, that in the primitive Church Christians and disciples\nwere the same persons.[1230] But here we see that he injudiciously\nreasons from a part to the whole. The appellation of disciples was given\nto persons of adult age, who had been already instructed, and had made a\nprofession of Christianity; just as the Jews under the law were the\ndisciples of Moses; yet no one can justly infer from this, that infants\nwere strangers, God having declared them to be part of his family. 12.\nMoreover he alleges, that all Christians are brethren, but that we treat\ninfants as not of that number, as long as we exclude them from the\nLord’s supper. But I return to that principle, that none are heirs of\nthe kingdom of heaven, except those who are members of Christ; and that\nthe embrace with which he honoured infants was a true pledge of the\nadoption, by which they are united with adults, and that their temporary\nabstinence from the supper does not prevent them from belonging to the\nbody of the Church. The thief who was converted on the cross was a\nbrother of believers, though he never partook of the Lord’s supper at\nall. 13. He proceeds to assert, that no person becomes our brother but\nby the spirit of adoption communicated “by the hearing of faith.”[1231]\nI reply, that he is constantly reverting to the same false reasoning, by\na preposterous application to infants of that which is spoken\nexclusively of adults. Paul is there showing that the ordinary method\nwhich God uses in calling his elect, and bringing them to the faith, is\nto raise them up faithful teachers, by whose labours and instructions he\nextends his assistance to them. But who will dare to impose a law to\nprevent his ingrafting infants into Christ by some other secret method?\n14. He objects, that Cornelius was baptized after he had received the\nHoly Ghost.[1232] But the absurdity of attempting to extract a general\nrule from this one example, is evident from the cases of the eunuch and\nthe Samaritans,[1233] in whom the Lord observed a different order, for\ntheir baptism preceded their reception of the gifts of the Spirit. 15.\nHis next argument is worse than absurd; he says, that by regeneration we\nare made gods;[1234] but that they are gods to whom the word of God\ncomes,[1235] which is not applicable to infants. The ascription of deity\nto believers is one of his reveries, which it is irrelevant to our\npresent subject to discuss; but to pervert that quotation from the\nPsalms to a sense so remote from its genuine meaning, betrays the most\nmonstrous impudence. Christ says that the appellation of _gods_ is given\nby the prophet to kings and magistrates, because they sustain an office\nof Divine appointment. But that which is directed to certain individuals\nrespecting the particular charge of governors, this dexterous\ninterpreter applies to the doctrine of the gospel, in order to exclude\ninfants from the Church. 16. He objects, again, that infants cannot be\naccounted new creatures, because they are not begotten by the word. I\nmust again repeat, what I have so often remarked, that the doctrine of\nthe gospel is the incorruptible seed, to regenerate those who are\ncapable of understanding it; but that where, by reason of age, there is\nnot yet any capacity of learning, God has his different degrees of\nregenerating those whom he has adopted. 17. Then he returns to his\nallegories, and alleges that sheep and goats were not offered in\nsacrifice immediately after they were brought forth.[1236] If I approved\nof the application of figures to this subject, I might easily retort,\nthat all the first born immediately on their birth are consecrated to\nthe Lord,[1237] and that a lamb was to be sacrificed in its first year;\nwhence it should follow, that it is not at all necessary to wait for\nmany years, but that our children ought to be dedicated to God in their\nearliest infancy. 18. He further contends, that none can come to Christ\nbut those who have been prepared by John; as though the office of John\nhad not been a temporary one. But to pass over this; the children whom\nChrist took up in his arms and blessed, had certainly no such\npreparation. Wherefore let him depart with his false principle. 19. At\nlength he calls in the assistance of Trismegistus and the Sibyls, to\nshow that sacred ablutions are not suitable to any but adults. See what\nhonourable sentiments he entertains respecting the baptism of Christ,\nwhich he would conform to the profane rites of the heathen, that its\nadministration might be regulated by the pleasure of Trismegistus. But\nwe have more reverence for the authority of God, who has been pleased to\nconsecrate infants to himself, and to initiate them by a sacred sign,\nthe meaning of which they were too young to be able to understand. Nor\ndo we esteem it lawful to borrow from the ablutions of the heathen any\nthing that may introduce into our baptism the least change of that\neternal and inviolable law which God has established respecting\ncircumcision. 20. In the last place, he argues, that if it be lawful to\nbaptize infants without understanding, baptism may be, in mimicry and\njest, administered by boys in play. But he must contest this subject\nwith God, by whose command circumcision was performed upon infants,\nbefore they had attained any understanding. Was it a ludicrous ceremony,\nthen, or a fit subject for the sports of children, that they could\noverturn the sacred institution of God? But it is no wonder that these\nreprobate spirits, as if transported with frenzy, bring forward the most\nenormous absurdities in defence of their errors; for such delusion is\nthe just judgment of God upon their pride and obstinacy. And I trust I\nhave clearly shown the futility of all the arguments with which Servetus\nhas endeavoured to assist the cause of his Anabaptist brethren.\nXXXII. No doubt, I conceive, can now remain in the mind of any sober\nman, that those who raise controversies and contentions on the subject\nof infant baptism are presumptuous disturbers of the Church of Christ.\nBut it is worth while to notice the object which Satan aims at promoting\nby so much subtlety; which is, to deprive us of the peculiar benefit of\nconfidence and spiritual joy, which is to be derived from this source,\nand in the same degree also to diminish the glory of the Divine\ngoodness. For how delightful is it to pious minds, not only to have\nverbal assurances, but even ocular proof, of their standing so high in\nthe favour of their heavenly Father, that their posterity are also the\nobjects of his care! For here we see how he sustains the character of a\nmost provident Father to us, since he discontinues not his solicitude\nfor us even after our death, but regards and provides for our children.\nOught we not, then, after the example of David, to exult in praise and\nthanksgiving to God with our whole heart, that his name may be glorified\nby such an expression of his goodness? This is evidently the reason why\nSatan makes such great exertions in opposition to infant baptism; that\nthe removal of this testimony of the grace of God may cause the promise\nwhich it exhibits before our eyes gradually to disappear, and at length\nto be forgotten. The consequence of this would be, an impious\ningratitude to the mercy of God, and negligence of the instruction of\nour children in the principles of piety. For it is no small stimulus to\nour education of them in the serious fear of God, and the observance of\nhis law, to reflect, that they are considered and acknowledged by him as\nhis children as soon as they are born. Wherefore, unless we are\nobstinately determined to obscure the goodness of God, let us present to\nhim our children, to whom he assigns a place in his family, that is,\namong the members of his Church.\nFootnote 1165:\nGen. xvii. 1-14.\nFootnote 1166:\nMatt. xxii. 32.

          "title": "CHAPTER XVII.",
          "content": "THE LORD’S SUPPER AND ITS ADVANTAGES.\nAfter God has once received us into his family, and not only so as to\nadmit us among his servants, but to number us with his children,—in\norder to fulfil the part of a most excellent father, solicitous for his\noffspring, he also undertakes to sustain and nourish us as long as we\nlive; and not content with this, he has been pleased to give us a\npledge, as a further assurance of this never-ceasing liberality. For\nthis purpose, therefore, by the hand of his only begotten Son, he has\nfavoured his Church with another sacrament, a spiritual banquet, in\nwhich Christ testifies himself to be the bread of life, to feed our\nsouls for a true and blessed immortality. Now, as the knowledge of so\ngreat a mystery is highly necessary, and on account of its importance,\nrequires an accurate explication; and, on the other hand, as Satan, in\norder to deprive the Church of this inestimable treasure, long ago\nendeavoured, first by mists, and afterwards by thicker shades, to\nobscure its lustre, and then raised disputes and contentions to alienate\nthe minds of the simple from a relish for this sacred food, and in our\ntime also has attempted the same artifice; after having exhibited a\nsummary of what relates to the subject, adapted to the capacity of the\nunlearned, I will disentangle it from those sophistries with which Satan\nhas been labouring to deceive the world. In the first place, the signs\nare bread and wine, which represent to us the invisible nourishment\nwhich we receive from the body and blood of Christ. For as in baptism\nGod regenerates us, incorporates us into the society of his Church, and\nmakes us his children by adoption, so we have said, that he acts towards\nus the part of a provident father of a family, in constantly supplying\nus with food, to sustain and preserve us in that life to which he has\nbegotten us by his word. Now, the only food of our souls is Christ; and\nto him, therefore, our heavenly Father invites us, that being refreshed\nby a participation of him, we may gain fresh vigour from day to day,\ntill we arrive at the heavenly immortality. And because this mystery of\nthe secret union of Christ with believers is incomprehensible by nature,\nhe exhibits a figure and image of it in visible signs, peculiarly\nadapted to our feeble capacity; and, as it were, by giving tokens and\npledges, renders it equally as certain to us as if we beheld it with our\neyes; for the dullest minds understand this very familiar similitude,\nthat our souls are nourished by Christ, just as the life of the body is\nsupported by bread and wine. We see, then, for what end this mystical\nbenediction is designed; namely, to assure us that the body of the Lord\nwas once offered as a sacrifice for us, so that we may now feed upon it,\nand, feeding on it, may experience within us the efficacy of that one\nsacrifice; and that his blood was once shed for us, so that it is our\nperpetual drink. And this is the import of the words of the promise\nannexed to it: “Take, eat; this is my body, which is given for you.” The\nbody, therefore, which was once offered for our salvation, we are\ncommanded to take and eat; that seeing ourselves made partakers of it,\nwe may certainly conclude, that the virtue of that life-giving death\nwill be efficacious within us. Hence, also, he calls the cup “the new\ntestament,” or rather _covenant_, in his blood.[1238] For the covenant\nwhich he once ratified with his blood, he in some measure renews, or\nrather continues, as far as relates to the confirmation of our faith,\nwhenever he presents us that sacred blood to drink.\nII. From this sacrament pious souls may derive the benefit of\nconsiderable satisfaction and confidence; because it affords us a\ntestimony that we are incorporated into one body with Christ, so that\nwhatever is his, we are at liberty to call ours. The consequence of this\nis, that we venture to assure ourselves of our interest in eternal life,\nof which he is the heir, and that the kingdom of heaven, into which he\nhas already entered, can no more be lost by us than by him; and, on the\nother hand, that we cannot be condemned by our sins, from the guilt of\nwhich he absolved us, when he wished them to be imputed to himself, as\nif they were his own. This is the wonderful exchange which, in his\ninfinite goodness, he has made with us. Submitting to our poverty, he\nhas transferred to us his riches; assuming our weakness, he has\nstrengthened us by his power; accepting our mortality, he has conferred\non us his immortality; taking on himself the load of iniquity with which\nwe were oppressed, he has clothed us with his righteousness; descending\nto the earth, he has prepared a way for our ascending to heaven;\nbecoming with us the Son of man, he has made us, with himself, the sons\nof God.\nIII. Of all these things we have such a complete attestation in this\nsacrament, that we may confidently consider them as truly exhibited to\nus, as if Christ himself were presented to our eyes, and touched by our\nhands. For there can be no falsehood or illusion in this word, “Take,\neat, drink; this is my body which is given for you; this is my blood\nwhich is shed for the remission of sins.” By commanding us to take, he\nsignifies that he is ours; by commanding us to eat and drink, he\nsignifies that he is become one substance with us. In saying that his\nbody is given for us, and his blood shed for us, he shows that both are\nnot so much his as ours, because he assumed and laid down both, not for\nhis own advantage, but for our salvation. And it ought to be carefully\nobserved, that the principal and almost entire energy of the sacrament\nlies in these words, “which is given for you;” “which is shed for you;”\nfor otherwise it would avail us but little, that the body and blood of\nthe Lord are distributed to us now, if they had not been once delivered\nfor our redemption and salvation. Therefore they are represented to us\nby bread and wine, to teach us that they are not only ours, but are\ndestined for the support of our spiritual life. This is what we have\nalready suggested—that by the corporeal objects which are presented in\nthe sacrament, we are conducted, by a kind of analogy, to those which\nare spiritual. So, when bread is given to us as a symbol of the body of\nChrist, we ought immediately to conceive of this comparison, that, as\nbread nourishes, sustains, and preserves the life of the body, so the\nbody of Christ is the only food to animate and support the life of the\nsoul. When we see wine presented as a symbol of his blood, we ought to\nthink of the uses of wine to the human body, that we may contemplate the\nsame advantages conferred upon us in a spiritual manner by the blood of\nChrist; which are these—that it nourishes, refreshes, strengthens, and\nexhilarates. For if we duly consider the benefits resulting to us from\nthe oblation of his sacred body, and the effusion of his blood, we shall\nclearly perceive that these properties of bread and wine, according to\nthis analogy, are most justly attributed to those symbols, as\nadministered to us in the Lord’s supper.\nIV. The principal object of the sacrament, therefore, is not to present\nus the body of Christ, simply, and without any ulterior consideration,\nbut rather to seal and confirm that promise, where he declares that his\n“flesh is meat indeed, and” his “blood drink indeed,” by which we are\nnourished to eternal life; where he affirms that he is “the bread of\nlife,” and that “he that eateth of this bread shall live for\never;”[1239] to seal and confirm that promise, I say; and, in order to\ndo this, it sends us to the cross of Christ, where the promise has been\nfully verified, and entirely accomplished. For we never rightly and\nadvantageously feed on Christ, except as crucified, and when we have a\nlively apprehension of the efficacy of his death. And, indeed, when\nChrist called himself “the bread of life,” he did not use that\nappellation on account of the sacrament, as some persons erroneously\nimagine, but because he had been given to us as such by the Father, and\nshowed himself to be such, when, becoming a partaker of our human\nmortality, he made us partakers of his Divine immortality; when,\noffering himself a sacrifice, he sustained our curse, to fill us with\nhis blessing; when, by his death, he destroyed and swallowed up death;\nwhen, in his resurrection, this corruptible flesh of ours, which he had\nassumed, was raised up by him, in a state of incorruption and glory.\nV. It remains for all this to be applied to us; which is done in the\nfirst place by the gospel, but in a more illustrious manner by the\nsacred supper, in which Christ offers himself to us with all his\nbenefits, and we receive him by faith. The sacrament, therefore, does\nnot first constitute Christ the bread of life; but, by recalling to our\nremembrance that he has been made the bread of life, upon which we may\nconstantly feed, and by giving us a taste and relish for that bread, it\ncauses us to experience the support which it is adapted to afford. For\nit assures us, in the first place, that whatever Christ has done or\nsuffered, was for the purpose of giving life to us; and, in the next\nplace, that this life will never end. For as Christ would never have\nbeen the bread of life to us, if he had not been born, and died, and\nrisen again for us, so now he would by no means continue so, if the\nefficacy and benefit of his nativity, death, and resurrection, were not\npermanent and immortal. All this Christ has beautifully expressed in\nthese words: “The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give\nfor the life of the world;”[1240] in which he clearly signifies, that\nhis body would be as bread to us, for the spiritual life of the soul,\nbecause it was to be exposed to death for our salvation; and that it is\ngiven to us to feed upon it, when he makes us partakers of it by faith.\nHe gave it once, therefore, to be made bread, when he surrendered it to\nbe crucified for the redemption of the world; he gives it daily, when,\nby the word of the gospel, he presents it to us, that we may partake of\nit as crucified; when he confirms that presentation by the sacred\nmystery of the supper; when he accomplishes within that which he\nsignifies without. Here it behoves us to guard against two errors; that,\non the one hand, we may not, by undervaluing the signs, disjoin them\nfrom the mysteries with which they are connected; nor, on the other\nhand, by extolling them beyond measure, obscure the glory of the\nmysteries themselves. That Christ is the bread of life, by which\nbelievers are nourished to eternal salvation, there is no man, not\nentirely destitute of religion, who hesitates to acknowledge; but all\nare not equally agreed respecting the manner of partaking of him. For\nthere are some who define in a word, that to eat the flesh of Christ,\nand to drink his blood, is no other than to believe in Christ himself.\nBut I conceive that, in that remarkable discourse, in which Christ\nrecommends us to feed upon his body, he intended to teach us something\nmore striking and sublime; namely, that we are quickened by a real\nparticipation of him, which he designates by the terms of _eating_ and\n_drinking_, that no person might suppose the life which we receive from\nhim to consist in simple knowledge. For as it is not _seeing_, but\n_eating_ bread, that administers nourishment to the body, so it is\nnecessary for the soul to have a true and complete participation of\nChrist, that by his power it may be quickened to spiritual life. At the\nsame time, we confess that there is no other eating than by faith, as it\nis impossible to imagine any other; but the difference between me and\nthe persons whose sentiment I am opposing, is this; they consider eating\nto be the very same as believing; I say, that in believing we eat the\nflesh of Christ, because he is actually made ours by faith, and that\nthis eating is the fruit and effect of faith; or, to express it more\nplainly, they consider the eating to be faith itself; but I apprehend it\nto be rather a consequence of faith. The difference is small in words,\nbut in the thing itself it is considerable. For though the apostle\nteaches that “Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith,”[1241] yet no one\nwill explain this inhabitation to be faith itself. Every one must\nperceive that the apostle intended to express a peculiar advantage\narising from faith, of which the residence of Christ in the hearts of\nbelievers is one of the effects. In the same manner, when the Lord\ncalled himself “the bread of life,”[1242] he intended not only to teach\nthat salvation is laid up for us in the faith of his death and\nresurrection, but also that, by our real participation of him, his life\nis transferred to us, and becomes ours; just as bread, when it is taken\nfor food, communicates vigour to the body.\nVI. When Augustine, whom they bring forward as their advocate, said that\nwe eat the body of Christ by believing in him, it was with no other\nmeaning than to show that this eating is not of a corporeal nature, but\nsolely by faith. This I admit; but at the same time I add, that we\nembrace Christ by faith, not as appearing at a distance, but as uniting\nhimself with us, to become our head, and to make us his members. I do\nnot altogether disapprove, however, such a mode of expression, but if\nthey mean to define what it is to eat the flesh of Christ, I deny this\nto be a complete explanation. Otherwise, I see that Augustine has\nfrequently used this phrase; as when he says, “Except ye eat the flesh\nof the Son of man, ye have no life in you;[1243] this is a figure which\nenjoins a participation of the sufferings of our Lord, and a sweet and\nuseful recollection in the memory, that his flesh was wounded and\ncrucified for us:” and again, when he says, “That the three thousand,\nwho were converted by the preaching of Peter,[1244] drank the blood of\nChrist by believing in him, which they had shed in persecuting him.” But\nin many other passages he highly celebrates that beneficial consequence\nof faith, and states our souls to be as much refreshed by the communion\nof the body of Christ, as our bodies are by the bread which we eat. And\nthe very same idea is conveyed by Chrysostom, when he says, “That Christ\nmakes us his body, not only by faith, but also in reality.” For he does\nnot mean that this benefit is obtained any otherwise than by faith; he\nonly intends to preclude a supposition from being entertained by any\none, that this faith is nothing more than a speculative apprehension. I\nsay nothing at present of those who maintain the Lord’s supper to be a\nmere mark of external profession, because I think I have sufficiently\nrefuted their error, when treating of the sacraments in general. Only\nlet it be observed, that when Christ says, “This cup is the new\ntestament, or covenant, in my blood,”[1245] this is the expression of a\npromise calculated for the confirmation of faith; whence it follows,\nthat unless we direct our views to God, and embrace what he offers us,\nwe never properly celebrate the sacred supper.\nVII. Nor am I satisfied with those persons, who, after having\nacknowledged that we have some communion with Christ, when they mean to\ndescribe it, represent us merely as partakers of his Spirit, but make no\nmention of his flesh and blood; as though there were no meaning in these\nand other similar expressions: “That his flesh is meat indeed; that his\nblood is drink indeed; that except we eat his flesh, and drink his\nblood, we have no life in us.” Wherefore, if it be evident that the full\ncommunion of Christ goes beyond their too confined description of it, I\nwill endeavour to state, in few words, how far it extends, before I\nspeak of the contrary error of carrying it to excess. For I shall have a\nlonger controversy with the hyperbolical doctors, who, while in their\nfolly they imagine an absurd and extravagant way of eating the flesh of\nChrist, and drinking his blood, deprive him of his real body, and\nmetamorphose him into a mere phantom; if, however, it be possible, in\nany words, to unfold so great a mystery, which I find myself incapable\nof properly comprehending, even in my mind; and this I am ready to\nacknowledge, that no person may measure the sublimity of the subject by\nmy inadequate representation of it. On the contrary, I exhort my readers\nnot to confine their thoughts within such narrow and insufficient\nlimits, but to endeavour to rise much higher than I am able to conduct\nthem; for as to myself, whenever I handle this subject, after having\nendeavoured to say every thing, I am conscious of having said but very\nlittle, in comparison of its excellence. And though the conceptions of\nthe mind can far exceed the expressions of the tongue, yet, with the\nmagnitude of the subject, the mind itself is oppressed and overwhelmed.\nNothing remains for me, therefore, but to break forth in admiration of\nthat mystery, which the mind is unable clearly to understand, or the\ntongue to express. I will nevertheless state the substance of my\nopinion, which, as I have no doubt of its truth, I trust will also be\nreceived with approbation by godly minds.\nVIII. In the first place, we learn from the Scriptures, that Christ was\nfrom the beginning that life-giving Word of the Father, the fountain and\norigin of life, from which all things have ever derived their existence.\nTherefore John in one place calls him “The Word of life,” and in another\nsays, that “in him was life;”[1246] signifying, that even then he\ndiffused his energy over all the creatures, and endued them with life\nand breath. Yet the same apostle immediately adds, that “the life was\nmanifested” then, and not before, when the Son of God, by assuming our\nflesh, rendered himself visible to the eyes, and palpable to the hands\nof men. For though he diffused his influence over all the creatures\nbefore that period, yet, because man was alienated from God by sin, had\nlost the participation of life, and saw nothing on every side but\nimpending death, it was necessary to his recovery of any hope of\nimmortality, that he should be received into the communion of that word.\nFor what slender hopes shall we form, if we hear that the Word of God\ncontains in himself all the plenitude of life, while we are at an\ninfinite distance from him, and, withersoever we turn our eyes, see\nnothing but death presenting itself on every side? But since he who is\nthe fountain of life has taken up his residence in our flesh, he remains\nno longer concealed at a distance from us, but openly exhibits himself\nto our participation. He also makes the very flesh in which he resides\nthe means of giving life to us, that, by a participation of it, we may\nbe nourished to immortality. “I am the living bread,” says he, “which\ncame down from heaven. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which\nI will give for the life of the world.”[1247] In these words, he shows,\nnot only that he is life, as he is the eternal Word who descended from\nheaven to us, but that in descending he imparted that power to the flesh\nwhich he assumed, in order that it might communicate life to us. Hence\nfollow these declarations: “That his flesh is meat indeed, and that his\nblood is drink indeed;”[1248] meat and drink by which believers are\nnourished to eternal life. Here, then, we enjoy peculiar consolation,\nthat we find life in our own flesh. For in this manner we not only have\nan easy access to it, but it freely discovers and offers itself to our\nacceptance; we have only to open our hearts to its reception, and we\nshall obtain it.\nIX. Now, though the power of giving life to us is not an essential\nattribute of the body of Christ, which, in its original condition, was\nsubject to mortality, and now lives by an immortality not its own, yet\nit is justly represented as the source of life, because it is endued\nwith a plenitude of life to communicate to us. In this I agree with\nCyril, in understanding that declaration of Christ, “As the Father hath\nlife in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in\nhimself.”[1249] For in this passage, he is not speaking of the\nattributes which he possessed with the Father from the beginning, but of\nthe gifts with which he was adorned in the flesh in which he appeared;\ntherefore he showed that the fulness of life dwelt in his humanity, that\nwhoever partook of his flesh and blood might, at the same time, enjoy a\nparticipation of life. For, as the water of a fountain is sometimes\ndrunk, sometimes drawn, and sometimes conveyed in furrows for the\nirrigation of lands, yet the fountain does not derive such an abundance\nfor so many uses from itself, but from the spring which is perpetually\nflowing to furnish it with fresh supplies, so the flesh of Christ is\nlike a rich and inexhaustible fountain, which receives the life flowing\nfrom the Divinity, and conveys it to us. Now, who does not see that a\nparticipation of the body and blood of Christ is necessary to all who\naspire to heavenly life? This is implied in those passages of the\napostle, that the Church is the body of Christ, and his fulness;[1250]\nthat he is “the head, from whom the whole body, joined together and\ncompacted by that which every joint supplieth, maketh increase of the\nbody;”[1251] that our bodies are “the members of Christ;”[1252] things\nwhich we know can no otherwise be effected than by his entire union both\nof body and spirit with us. But that most intimate fellowship, by which\nwe are united with his flesh, the apostle has illustrated in a still\nmore striking representation, when he says, “We are members of his body,\nof his flesh, and of his bones.”[1253] At length, to declare the subject\nto be above all description, he concludes his discourse by exclaiming,\n“This is a great mystery.”[1254] It would be extreme stupidity,\ntherefore, to acknowledge no communion of believers with the body and\nblood of the Lord, which the apostle declares to be so great, that he\nwould rather admire than express it.\nX. We conclude, that our souls are fed by the flesh and blood of Christ,\njust as our corporeal life is preserved and sustained by bread and wine.\nFor otherwise there would be no suitableness in the analogy of the sign,\nif our souls did not find their food in Christ; which cannot be the case\nunless Christ truly becomes one with us, and refreshes us by the eating\nof his flesh and the drinking of his blood. Though it appears incredible\nfor the flesh of Christ, from such an immense local distance, to reach\nus, so as to become our food, we should remember how much the secret\npower of the Holy Spirit transcends all our senses, and what folly it is\nto apply any measure of ours to his immensity. Let our faith receive,\ntherefore, what our understanding is not able to comprehend, that the\nSpirit really unites things which are separated by local distance. Now,\nthat holy participation of his flesh and blood, by which Christ\ncommunicates his life to us, just as if he actually penetrated every\npart of our frame, in the sacred supper he also testifies and seals; and\nthat not by the exhibition of a vain or ineffectual sign, but by the\nexertion of the energy of his Spirit, by which he accomplishes that\nwhich he promises. And the thing signified he exhibits and offers to all\nwho come to that spiritual banquet; though it is advantageously enjoyed\nby believers alone, who receive such great goodness with true faith and\ngratitude of mind. For which reason the apostle said, “The cup of\nblessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?\nThe bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of\nChrist?”[1255] Nor is there any cause to object, that it is a figurative\nexpression, by which the name of the thing signified is given to the\nsign. I grant, indeed, that the breaking of the bread is symbolical, and\nnot the substance itself: yet, this being admitted, from the exhibition\nof the symbol we may justly infer the exhibition of the substance; for,\nunless any one would call God a deceiver, he can never presume to affirm\nthat he sets before us an empty sign. Therefore, if, by the breaking of\nthe bread, the Lord truly represents the participation of his body, it\nought not to be doubted that he truly presents and communicates it. And\nit must always be a rule with believers, whenever they see the signs\ninstituted by the Lord, to assure and persuade themselves that they are\nalso accompanied with the truth of the thing signified. For to what end\nwould the Lord deliver into our hands the symbol of his body, except to\nassure us of a real participation of it? If it be true that the visible\nsign is given to us to seal the donation of the invisible substance, we\nought to entertain a confident assurance, that in receiving the symbol\nof his body, we at the same time truly receive the body itself.\nXI. In harmony, therefore, with the doctrine which has always been\nreceived in the Church, and which is maintained in the present day by\nall who hold right sentiments, I say, that the sacred mystery of the\nsupper consists of two parts: the corporeal signs, which, being placed\nbefore our eyes, represent to us invisible things in a manner adapted to\nthe weakness of our capacities; and the spiritual truth, which is at the\nsame time typified and exhibited by those symbols. When I intend to give\na familiar view of this truth, I am accustomed to state three\nparticulars which it includes: the signification; the matter, or\nsubstance, which depends on the signification; and the virtue, or\neffect, which follows from both. The signification consists in the\npromises which are interwoven with the sign. What I call the matter or\nsubstance, is Christ, with his death and resurrection. By the effect, I\nmean redemption, righteousness, sanctification, eternal life, and all\nthe other benefits which Christ confers upon us. Now, though all these\nthings are connected with faith, yet I leave no room for this cavil; as\nthough, when I say that Christ is received by faith, I intended that he\nis received merely in the understanding and imagination; for the\npromises present him to us, not that we may rest in mere contemplation\nand simple knowledge, but that we may enjoy a real participation of him.\nAnd, in fact, I see not how any man can attain a solid confidence that\nhe has redemption and righteousness in the cross of Christ, and life in\nhis death, unless he first has a real communion with Christ himself; for\nthose blessings would never be imparted to us, if Christ did not first\nmake himself ours. I say, therefore, that in the mystery of the supper,\nunder the symbols of bread and wine, Christ is truly exhibited to us,\neven his body and blood, in which he has fulfilled all obedience to\nprocure our justification. And the design of this exhibition is, first,\nthat we may be united into one body with him, and, secondly, that being\nmade partakers of his substance, we may experience his power in the\ncommunication of all blessings.\nXII. I now proceed to the hyperbolical additions which superstition has\nmade to this sacrament. For here Satan has exerted amazing subtlety to\nwithdraw the minds of men from heaven, and involve them in a\npreposterous error, by persuading them that Christ is attached to the\nelement of bread. In the first place, we must be careful not to dream of\nsuch a presence of Christ in the sacrament as the ingenuity of the\nRomanists has invented; as if the body of Christ were exhibited, by a\nlocal presence, to be felt by the hand, bruised by the teeth, and\nswallowed by the throat. For this was the form of recantation which Pope\nNicolas directed to Berengarius as a declaration of his repentance; the\nlanguage of which is so monstrous, that the scholiast exclaims, that\nthere is danger, unless the readers be very prudent and cautious, of\ntheir imbibing from it a worse heresy than that of Berengarius; and\nPeter Lombard, though he takes great pains to defend it from the charge\nof absurdity, yet rather inclines to a different opinion. For, as we\nhave not the least doubt that Christ’s body is finite, according to the\ninvariable condition of a human body, and is contained in heaven, where\nit was once received, till it shall return to judgment, so we esteem it\nutterly unlawful to bring it back under these corruptible elements, or\nto imagine it to be present every where. Nor is there any need of this,\nin order to our enjoying the participation of it; since the Lord by his\nSpirit gives us the privilege of being united with himself in body,\nsoul, and spirit. The bond of this union, therefore, is the Spirit of\nChrist, by whom we are conjoined, and who is, as it were, the channel by\nwhich all that Christ himself is and has is conveyed to us. For, if we\nbehold the sun darting his rays and transmitting his substance, as it\nwere, in them, to generate, nourish, and mature the roots of the earth,\nwhy should the irradiation of the Spirit of Christ be less effectual to\nconvey to us the communication of his body and blood? Wherefore, the\nScripture, when it speaks of our participation of Christ, attributes all\nthe power of it to the Spirit. One passage shall suffice instead of\nmany. In the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, Paul\nrepresents Christ as dwelling in us no otherwise than by his\nSpirit.[1256] By this representation, the apostle does not destroy that\ncommunion of the body and blood of Christ of which we are now treating,\nbut teaches that it is solely owing to the agency of the Spirit that we\npossess Christ with all his benefits, and have him dwelling within us.\nXIII. Deterred by a horror of such barbarous impiety, the schoolmen have\nexpressed themselves in more modest language, yet they only trifle with\nequal fallacy and greater subtlety. They admit that Christ is not\ncontained in the bread and wine in a local or corporeal manner; but they\nafterwards invent a manner which they neither understand themselves nor\ncan explain to others; which, however, amounts to this, that Christ is\nto be sought, as they express it, in the form of bread. When they say\nthat the substance of bread is transmuted into Christ, do they not\nattach his substance to the whiteness, which they pretend is all that\nremains of the bread? But, they say, he is so contained in the\nsacrament, that he remains in heaven, and we maintain no other presence\nthan that of _habitude_. But whatever words they employ to gloss over\ntheir notions, they all terminate in this, that, by the consecration,\nthat which was before bread becomes Christ, so that the substance of\nChrist is concealed under the colour of bread. This they are not ashamed\nto express in plain terms; for Lombard says, “That the body of Christ,\nwhich is visible in itself, is hidden and concealed, after the\nconsecration, under the form of bread.” Thus the figure of the bread is\nnothing but a veil, which prevents the flesh from being seen. Nor is\nthere any need of many conjectures, to discover what snares they\nintended to lay in these words, which the thing itself plainly evinces.\nFor it is evident in what profound superstition not only the people in\ngeneral, but even the principal men, have now for several ages been\ninvolved, and are involved, at the present day, in the Papal churches.\nTrue faith, which is the sole medium of our union and communion with\nChrist, being an object of little solicitude to them, provided they have\nthat carnal presence which they have fabricated without any authority\nfrom the Divine word, they consider him as sufficiently present with\nthem. The consequence of this ingenious subtlety, therefore, we find to\nbe this, that bread has been taken for God.\nXIV. Hence proceeded that pretended transubstantiation, for which they\nnow contend with more earnestness than for all the other articles of\ntheir faith. For the first inventors of the local presence were unable\nto explain how the body of Christ could be mixed with the substance of\nthe bread, without being immediately embarrassed by many absurdities.\nTherefore they found it necessary to have recourse to this fiction, that\nthe bread is transmuted into the body of Christ; not that his body is\nproperly made of the bread, but that Christ annihilates the substance of\nthe bread, and conceals himself under its form. It is astonishing that\nthey could fall into such ignorance, and even stupidity, as to\npromulgate such a monstrous notion, in direct opposition to the\nScripture and to the doctrine of the primitive Church. I confess,\nindeed, that some of the ancient writers sometimes used the word\n_conversion_, not with a view to destroy the substance of the external\nsigns, but to signify that the bread dedicated to that sacrament is\nunlike common bread, and different from what it was before. But they all\nconstantly and expressly declare, that the sacred supper consists of two\nparts, earthly and heavenly; and the earthly part they explain, without\nthe least hesitation, to be bread and wine. Whatever the Romanists may\npretend, it is very clear that the authority of the ancients, which they\nfrequently presume to oppose to the plain word of God, affords them no\nassistance in the support of this dogma; and, indeed, it is\ncomparatively but of recent invention, for it was not only unknown to\nthose better times, when the doctrine of religion still flourished in\nits purity, but even when that purity had already been much corrupted.\nThere is not one of the ancient writers who does not acknowledge in\nexpress terms that the consecrated symbols of the supper are bread and\nwine; though, as we have observed, they sometimes distinguish them with\nvarious titles, to celebrate the dignity of the mystery. For when they\nsay, that a secret _conversion_ takes place in the consecration, so that\nthey are something different from bread and wine, I have already stated\ntheir meaning to be, not that the bread and wine are annihilated, but\nthat they are to be considered in a different light from common\naliments, which are merely designed for the nourishment of the body;\nbecause, in those elements, we are presented with the spiritual meat and\ndrink of the soul. In this we also coincide. But, say our opponents, if\nthere be a conversion, one thing must be changed into another. If they\nmean that something is made what it was not before, I agree with them.\nIf they wish to apply this to their absurd notion, let them tell me what\nchange they think takes place in baptism. For in that also the fathers\nstate a wonderful conversion, when they say, that from the corruptible\nelement proceeds a spiritual ablution of the soul, yet not one of them\ndenies that it retains the substance of water. But there is no such\ndeclaration, they say, respecting baptism as there is respecting the\nsupper: “This is my body.” As though the question related to those\nwords, which have a meaning obvious enough, and not rather to the\nconversion or change spoken of, which ought to signify no more in the\nsupper than in baptism. Let them cease their verbal subtleties,\ntherefore, which only betray their own absurdity. Indeed, there would be\nno consistency in the signification, if the external sign were not a\nliving image of the truth which is represented in it. By the external\nsign, Christ intended to declare that his flesh is meat. If he were to\nset before us a mere spectre of bread, and not real bread, where would\nbe the analogy or similitude, which ought to lead us from the visible\nemblem to the invisible substance? For, to preserve the correspondence\ncomplete, the signification would extend no further than that we should\nbe fed with an appearance of the flesh of Christ. As in baptism, if\nthere were nothing but an appearance of water to deceive our eyes, we\nshould have no certain pledge of our ablution; and such an illusive\nrepresentation we should find a source of painful uncertainty. The\nnature of the sacrament, therefore, is subverted, unless the earthly\nsign correspond in its signification to the heavenly substance; and,\nconsequently, we lose the truth of this mystery, unless the true body of\nChrist be represented by real bread. I repeat it again; since the sacred\nsupper is nothing but a visible attestation of the promise, that Christ\nis “the bread of life which cometh down from heaven,”[1257] it requires\nthe use of visible and material bread to represent that which is\nspiritual; unless we are determined that the means which God kindly\naffords to support our weakness shall be altogether unavailing to us.\nWith what reason could Paul conclude that “we, being many, are one\nbread, for we are all partakers of that one bread,”[1258] if there were\nnothing but a mere phantom of bread, and not the true and real substance\nof it?\nXV. They would never have been so shamefully deluded by the fallacies of\nSatan, if they had not been previously fascinated with this error—that\nthe body of Christ contained in the bread was received in a corporeal\nmanner into the mouth, and actually swallowed. The cause of such a\nstupid notion was, that they considered the consecration as a kind of\nmagical incantation. But they were unacquainted with this principle,\nthat the bread is a sacrament only to those to whom the word is\naddressed; as the water of baptism is not changed in itself, but on the\nannexation of the promise, begins to be to us that which it was not\nbefore. This will be further elucidated by the example of a similar\nsacrament. The water which flowed from the rock in the wilderness, was\nto the fathers a token and sign of the same thing which is represented\nto us by the wine in the sacred supper; for Paul says, “They did drink\nthe same spiritual drink.”[1259] But the same water served also for\ntheir flocks and herds. Hence it is easily inferred, that when earthly\nelements are applied to a spiritual use, no other change takes place in\nthem than with regard to _men_, to whom they become seals of the\npromises. Besides, since the design of God is, as I have often repeated,\nby suitable vehicles to elevate us to himself, this object is impiously\nfrustrated by the obstinacy of those who invite us to Christ indeed, but\ninvisibly concealed under the form of bread. It is not possible for the\nhuman mind to overcome the immensity of local distance, and to penetrate\nto Christ in the highest heavens. What nature denied them, they\nattempted to correct by a remedy yet more pernicious, that while\nremaining on the earth, they might attain a proximity to Christ without\nany need of ascending to heaven. This is all the necessity which\nconstrained them to metamorphose the body of Christ. In the time of\nBernard, though a harsh mode of expression had been adopted, still\ntransubstantiation was yet unknown; and in all preceding ages it was a\ncommon similitude, in the mouths of all, that in this sacrament the body\nand blood of Christ were spiritually united with the bread and wine.\nThey argue respecting the terms, in their own apprehension, with great\nacuteness, but without adducing any thing applicable to the present\nsubject. The rod of Moses, they say, though it took the form of a\nserpent, still retained its original name, and was called a rod.[1260]\nSo they think it equally probable, that though the bread be changed into\nanother substance, yet it may by a catachresis, without any violation of\npropriety, be denominated according to its visible appearance. But what\nsimilitude or connection can they discover between that illustrious\nmiracle and their fictitious illusion, which no eye on earth witnesses?\nThe magicians had practised their sorceries, so that the Egyptians\nbelieved them to possess a Divine power to effect changes in the\ncreatures above the order of nature. Moses confronted them, and\ndefeating all their enchantments, showed the invincible power of God to\nbe on his side; because his one rod swallowed up all the rest. But that\nbeing a transmutation visible to the eye, makes nothing to the present\nargument, as we have already observed; and the rod soon after visibly\nreturned to its original form. Moreover, it is not known whether that\nwas in reality a temporary transmutation of substance or not. The\nallusion to the rods of the magicians deserves also to be observed; for\nMoses says, that “Aaron’s rod swallowed up their _rods_:” he would not\ncall them serpents, lest he might appear to imply a transmutation which\ndid not exist; for those impostors had done nothing but dazzle the eyes\nof the spectators. What resemblance has this to the following and other\nsimilar expressions: “The bread which we break;”[1261] “As often as ye\neat this bread;”[1262] “They continued in breaking of bread?”[1263] It\nis certain that their eyes were only deceived by the incantations of the\nmagicians. There is greater uncertainty with respect to Moses, by whose\nhand it was no more difficult for God to make a rod into a serpent, and\nafterwards to make the serpent into a rod again, than to invest angels\nwith material bodies, and soon after to disembody them again. If the\nnature of this sacrament were the same, or bore any affinity to the case\nwe have mentioned, our opponents would have some colour for their\nsolution. We must, therefore, consider it as a fixed principle, that the\nflesh of Christ is not truly promised to us for food in the sacred\nsupper, unless the true substance of the external symbol corresponds to\nit. And as one error gives birth to another, a passage of Jeremiah is so\nstupidly perverted, in order to prove transubstantiation, that I am\nashamed to recite it. The prophet complains that wood was put into his\nbread;[1264] signifying that his enemies by their cruelty had taken away\nall the relish of his food; as David in a similar figure utters the\nfollowing complaint: “They gave me also gall for my meat, and in my\nthirst they gave me vinegar to drink.”[1265] These disputants explain it\nas an allegory, that the body of Christ was affixed to the wood of the\ncross; and this, they say, was the opinion of some of the fathers. I\nreply, we ought rather to pardon their ignorance, and bury their\ndisgrace in oblivion, than to add the effrontery of constraining them\ncontinually to combat the genuine meaning of the prophet.\nXVI. Others, who perceive it to be impossible to destroy the analogy of\nthe sign and the thing signified, without subverting the truth of the\nmystery, acknowledge that the bread in the sacred supper is the true\nsubstance of that earthly and corruptible element, and undergoes no\nchange in itself; but they maintain that it has the body of Christ\nincluded under it. If they explained their meaning to be, that when the\nbread is presented in the sacrament, it is attended with an exhibition\nof the body of Christ, because the truth represented is inseparable from\nits sign, I should make little objection; but as, by placing the body\nitself in the bread, they attribute ubiquity to it, which is\nincompatible with its nature, and by stating it to be _under the bread_,\nrepresent it as lying concealed in it; it is necessary to unmask such\nsubtleties: not that it is my intention to enter on a professed\nexamination of the whole of this subject at present; I shall only lay\nthe foundations of the discussion, which will follow in its proper\nplace. They maintain the body of Christ, therefore, to be invisible and\ninfinite, that it may be concealed under the bread; because they suppose\nit to be impossible for them to partake of him, any otherwise than by\nhis descending into the bread; but they know nothing of that descent of\nwhich we have spoken, by which he elevates us to himself. They bring\nforward every plausible pretext that they can; but when they have said\nall, it is evident that they are contending for a local presence of\nChrist. And what is the reason of it? It is because they cannot conceive\nof any other participation of his flesh and blood, except what would\nconsist in local conjunction and contact, or in some gross enclosure.\nXVII. And to defend with obstinacy the error which they have once\nembraced, some of them hesitate not to affirm that the body of Christ\nnever had any other dimensions than the whole extent of heaven and\nearth. His birth as an infant, his growth to maturity, his extension on\nthe cross, his incarceration in the sepulchre,—all this, they say, took\nplace in consequence of a kind of dispensation, that he might as a man\naccomplish every thing necessary to our salvation. His appearance in the\nsame corporeal form after his resurrection, his ascension to heaven, his\nsubsequent appearances to Stephen and to Paul,—all this also resulted\nfrom a similar dispensation, that he might manifest himself to the view\nof man as appointed King in heaven. Now, what is this but to raise\nMarcion from the dead? For if such were the condition of Christ’s body,\nevery one must perceive it to have been a mere phantom or visionary\nform, without any real substance. Some plead, with a little more\nsubtlety, that the body of Christ, which is given in the sacrament, is\nglorious and immortal, and that therefore it involves no absurdity, if\nit be contained under the sacrament in various places, or in no place,\nor without any form. But I ask what kind of body did Jesus Christ give\nto his disciples, the night before he suffered? Do not the words imply,\nthat he gave them the same mortal body which was just about to be\nbetrayed? They reply, that he had already manifested his glory in the\neyes of three of his disciples, on the mount. That is true; but his\ndesign was, in that splendour, to give them a transient glimpse of his\nimmortality. They will not find there a twofold body, but the very same\nwhich Christ was accustomed to carry about with him, adorned with\nunusual glory, from which it speedily returned to its natural condition.\nWhen he distributed his body at the institution of the sacred supper,\nthe hour was approaching, in which, “stricken and smitten of God,” he\nwas to lie down like a leper “without form or comeliness:”[1266] he was\nthen far from intending to display the glory of his resurrection. What a\ndoor does this open to the error of Marcion, if the body of Christ\nappeared in one place mortal and mean, and in another was received as\nimmortal and glorious? On their principle, however, this happens every\nday; for they are constrained to confess that the body of Christ is\nvisible in itself, while at the same time they say that it is invisibly\nconcealed under the symbol of bread. And yet the promulgators of such\nmonstrous absurdities are so far from being ashamed of their disgrace,\nthat they stigmatize us with unprovoked and enormous calumnies, because\nwe refuse to subscribe to them.\nXVIII. If they are determined to fasten the body and blood of the Lord\nto the bread and wine, one must of necessity be severed from the other.\nFor as the bread is presented separately from the cup, the body, being\nunited to the bread, must consequently be divided from the blood\ncontained in the cup. For when they affirm that the body is in the\nbread, and the blood in the cup, while the bread and the wine are at\nsome distance from each other, no sophistry will enable them to evade\nthis conclusion—that the body is separated from the blood. Their usual\npretence, that the blood is in the body, and the body in the blood, by\nwhat they call _concomitance_, is perfectly frivolous, while the symbols\nin which they are contained are so divided. But if we elevate our views\nand thoughts towards heaven, to seek Christ there in the glory of his\nkingdom, as the symbols invite us to him entire, under the symbol of\nbread we shall eat his body, under the symbol of wine we shall\ndistinctly drink his blood, so that we shall thus enjoy him entire. For\nthough he has removed his flesh from us, and in his body is ascended to\nheaven, yet he sits at the Father’s right hand, that is, he reigns in\nthe power, and majesty, and glory of the Father. This kingdom is neither\nlimited to any local space, nor circumscribed by any dimensions; Christ\nexerts his power wherever he pleases in heaven and earth, exhibits\nhimself present in his energetic influence, is constantly with his\npeople, inspiring his life into them, lives in them, sustains them,\nstrengthens and invigorates them, just as if he were corporeally\npresent; in short, he feeds them with his own body, of which he gives\nthem a participation by the influence of his Spirit. This is the way in\nwhich the body and blood of Christ are exhibited to us in the sacrament.\nXIX. It is necessary for us to establish such a presence of Christ in\nthe sacred supper, as neither, on the one hand, to fasten him to the\nelement of bread, or to enclose him in it, or in any way to circumscribe\nhim, which would derogate from his celestial glory; nor, on the other\nhand, to deprive him of his corporeal dimensions, or to represent his\nbody as in different places at once, or to assign it an immensity\ndiffused through heaven and earth, which would be clearly inconsistent\nwith the reality of his human nature. Let us never suffer ourselves to\nbe driven from these two exceptions; that nothing be maintained\nderogatory to Christ’s celestial glory; which is the case when he is\nrepresented as brought under the corruptible elements of this world, or\nfastened to any earthly objects; and that nothing be attributed to his\nbody incompatible with the human nature; which is the case when it is\nrepresented as infinite, or is said to be in more places than one at the\nsame time. These absurdities being disclaimed, I readily admit whatever\nmay serve to express the true and substantial communication of the body\nand blood of the Lord, which is given to believers under the sacred\nsymbols of the supper; and to express it in a manner implying not a mere\nreception of it in the imagination or apprehension of their mind, but a\nreal enjoyment of it as the food of eternal life. Nor can any cause be\nassigned, why this opinion is so odious to the world, and the minds of\nmultitudes are so unjustly prejudiced against any defence of it, but\nthat they have been awfully infatuated with the delusions of Satan. It\nis certain that the doctrine we advance is in all respects in perfect\nharmony with the Scriptures; it contains nothing absurd, ambiguous, or\nobscure; it is not at all inimical to true piety, or solid edification;\nin short, it includes nothing that can offend, except that for several\nages, while the ignorance and barbarism of the sophists prevailed over\nthe Church, this very clear light and obvious truth was shamefully\nsuppressed. Yet, as, in the present age also, Satan is making the most\npowerful exertions to oppose it, and is employing turbulent spirits to\nendeavour to blacken it by every possible calumny and reproach, it is\nnecessary to be the more diligent in asserting and defending it.\nXX. Now, before we proceed any further, it is requisite to discuss the\ninstitution itself; because the most plausible objection of our\nadversaries is, that we depart from the words of Christ. To exonerate\nourselves from the false charge which they bring against us, it is\nhighly proper, therefore, to begin with an exposition of the words. The\naccount given by three of the evangelists, and by Paul, informs us, that\n“Jesus took bread, and gave thanks, and blessed it, and brake it, and\ngave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is\ngiven or broken for you. And he took the cup, and said, This cup is my\nblood of the new testament, or the new testament in my blood, which is\nshed for you, and for many, for the remission of sins.”[1267] The\nadvocates of transubstantiation contend that the pronoun _this_ denotes\nthe appearance of the bread, because the consecration is made by the\nwhole of the sentence, and there is no visible substance, according to\nthem, which can be indicated by it. But if they are guided by a\nscrupulous attention to the words, because Christ declared that which he\ngave into the hands of his disciples to be his body, nothing can be more\nat variance with a just interpretation of them, than the notion that\nwhat before was bread had now become the body of Christ. For it was that\nwhich Christ took into his hands to deliver to his disciples, that he\nasserts to be his body; but he took “_bread_.” Who does not perceive,\nthen, that that to which this pronoun referred was bread still? and\ntherefore nothing would be more absurd than to transfer to a mere\nappearance or visionary form that which was spoken of real bread.\nOthers, when they explain the word _is_ to denote transubstantiation,\nhave recourse to an interpretation still more violently perverted and\nunnatural. They have not the least colour, therefore, for a pretence\nthat they are influenced by a scrupulous reverence for the words of\nChrist. For to use the word _is_ to signify a transmutation into another\nsubstance, is a thing never heard of, in any country or in any language.\nThose who acknowledge the continuance of bread in the supper, and affirm\nthat it is accompanied with the real body of Christ, differ considerably\namong themselves. Those of them who express themselves more modestly,\nthough they strenuously insist on the literal meaning of these words,\n“_This is my body_,” yet afterwards depart from their literal precision,\nand explain them to import that the body of Christ is with the bread, in\nthe bread, and under the bread. Of the opinion maintained by them, we\nhave already spoken, and shall soon have occasion to take further\nnotice; at present I am only arguing respecting the words, by which they\nconsider themselves bound, so that they cannot admit the bread to be\ncalled _his body_, because it is a sign of it. But if they object to\nevery trope, and insist on taking the words in a sense strictly literal,\nwhy do they forsake the language of Christ, and adopt a phraseology of\ntheir own so very dissimilar? For there is a wide difference between\nthese two assertions, that “the bread is the body,” and that “the body\nis with the bread.” But because they perceived the impossibility of\nsupporting this simple proposition, “that the bread is the body,” they\nhave endeavoured to escape from their embarrassment by those evasions.\nOthers, more daring, hesitate not to assert, that, in strict propriety\nof speech, the bread _is_ the body; and thereby prove themselves to be\nadvocates for a truly literal interpretation. If it be objected, that\nthen the bread is Christ, and Christ is God, they will deny this,\nbecause it is not expressed in the words of Christ. But they will gain\nnothing by their denial of it, for it is universally admitted that the\nwhole person of Christ is offered to us in the sacrament. Now, it would\nbe intolerable blasphemy to affirm of a frail and corruptible element,\nwithout any figure, that it is Christ. I ask them whether these two\npropositions are equivalent to each other—_Christ is the Son of God_,\nand _Bread is the body of Christ_. If they confess them to be\ndifferent,—a confession which, if they hesitated, it would be easy to\nextort from them,—let them say wherein the difference consists. I\nsuppose they will adduce no other point of difference, than that the\nbread is called _the body_ in a sacramental sense. Whence it follows,\nthat the words of Christ are not subject to any common rule, and ought\nnot to be examined on the principles of grammar. I would likewise\ninquire of the inflexible champions of a literal interpretation, whether\nthe words attributed to Christ, by Luke and Paul, “This cup _is_ the new\ntestament in my blood,” do not express the same idea as the former\nclause, in which the bread is called his body. Surely the same reverence\nought to be shown to one part of the sacrament as to the other; and\nbecause brevity is obscure, the sense is elucidated by a fuller\nstatement. Whenever, therefore, they shall argue, from that one word,\nthat the bread is the body of Christ, I shall adduce the interpretation\nfurnished by the fuller account, that it is the _testament_ in his body.\nFor shall we seek for an expositor of greater fidelity or accuracy than\nPaul and Luke? Nor is it my design to diminish in the smallest degree\nthat participation of the body of Christ, which I have acknowledged is\nenjoyed; my only object is, to silence that foolish obstinacy which\ndisplays itself in violent contentions about words. From the authority\nof Paul and Luke, I understand the bread to be the body of Christ,\nbecause it is the covenant in his body. If they resist this, their\ncontention is not with me, but with the Spirit of God. Notwithstanding\nthey profess to be influenced by such reverence for the words of Christ,\nthat they dare not understand an explicit declaration of his in a\nfigurative sense, yet this pretext is not sufficient to justify their\npertinacious rejection of all the reasons which we allege to the\ncontrary. At the same time, as I have already suggested, it is necessary\nto understand what is meant by “the testament in the body and blood of\nChrist;” because we should derive no benefit from the covenant ratified\nby the sacrifice of his death, if it were not followed by that secret\ncommunication by which we become one with him.\nXXI. It remains for us, therefore, to acknowledge that, on account of\nthe affinity which the things signified have with their symbols, the\nname of the substance has been given to the sign, in a figurative sense\nindeed, but by a most apt analogy. I forbear to introduce any thing of\nallegories and parables, lest any one should accuse me of having\nrecourse to subterfuges, and travelling out of the present subject. I\nobserve that this is a metonymical form of expression, which is commonly\nused in the Scripture in reference to sacraments. For in no other sense\nis it possible to understand such passages as these; when of\ncircumcision it is said, “This is my covenant;”[1268] of the paschal\nlamb, “It is the Lord’s passover;”[1269] of the legal sacrifices, that\nthey were expiations, or atonements;[1270] of the rock, from which the\nwater issued in the desert, “That Rock was Christ.”[1271] And not only\nis the name of something superior transferred to that which is inferior,\nbut, on the contrary, the name of the visible sign is likewise given to\nthe thing signified; as when God is said to have appeared to Moses in\nthe bush,[1272] when the ark of the covenant is called God,[1273] and\nthe Holy Spirit, a dove.[1274] For, though there is an essential\ndifference between the symbol and the thing signified, the former being\ncorporeal, terrestrial, and visible, and the latter spiritual,\ncelestial, and invisible, yet, as the symbol is not a vain and useless\nmemorial, a mere adumbration of the thing which it has been consecrated\nto represent, but also a true and real exhibition of it, why may not the\nname of that which it signifies be justly applied to it? If symbols\ninvented by man, which are rather emblems of things absent, than tokens\nof things present, of which also they very frequently give a delusive\nrepresentation, are, nevertheless, sometimes distinguished by the names\nof the things which they signify, there is far greater reason why the\nsymbols instituted by God should borrow the names of those things of\nwhich they always exhibit a correct and faithful representation, and by\nthe truth of which they are always accompanied. So great, therefore, is\nthe similitude and affinity of the one to the other, that there is\nnothing at all unnatural in such a mutual interchange of appellations.\nLet our adversaries cease, then, to assail us with their ridiculous wit,\nby calling us Tropologists, because we explain the sacramental\nphraseology according to the common usage of the Scripture. For as there\nis a great similarity in many respects between the various sacraments,\nso this metonymical transfer of names is common to them all. As the\napostle, therefore, states, that “the Rock” from which flowed “spiritual\ndrink” for the Israelites, “was Christ,”[1275] because it was a visible\nsymbol, under which “that spiritual drink” was received, though not in a\nmanner discernible by the corporeal eye, so bread is now called the body\nof Christ, because it is the symbol under which the Lord truly offers us\nhis body to eat. And that no one may despise this as a novel sentiment,\nwe shall show that the same was entertained by Augustine. He says, “If\nthe sacraments had not some similitude to those things of which they are\nsacraments, they would be no sacraments at all. On account of this\nsimilitude, they frequently take the names even of the things which they\nrepresent. Therefore, as the sacrament of the body of Christ is in some\nsense that body itself, and the sacrament of the blood of Christ, is\nthat blood itself, so the sacrament of faith is called faith.” His works\ncontain many similar passages, which it would be useless to collect, as\nthis one is sufficient; only the reader ought to be apprized that this\nholy father repeats and confirms the same observation in an epistle to\nEuodius. It is a frivolous subterfuge to plead, that when Augustine\nspeaks of metonymical expressions, as frequently and commonly used\nrespecting the sacraments, he makes no mention of the Lord’s supper;\nfor, if this were admitted, we could no longer reason from the genus to\nthe species, or from the whole to a part; it would not be a good\nargument to say, that every animal is endued with the power of motion,\ntherefore oxen and horses are endued with the power of motion. All\nfurther dispute on this point, however, is precluded by the language of\nthe same writer on another occasion—“that Christ did not hesitate to\ncall it his body, when he gave it as the sign of his body.” Again: “It\nwas wonderful patience in Christ, to admit Judas to the feast, in which\nhe instituted and gave to his disciples the emblem of his body and of\nhis blood.”\nXXII. But if some obstinate man, shutting his eyes against every other\nconsideration, should insist on this single expression, “_This is_ my\nbody,” as though it made a distinction between the supper and all other\nsacraments, the answer is easy. They allege that the verb substantive is\ntoo emphatical to admit of any figure. If we grant this, the verb\nsubstantive is also used by Paul, where he says, “The bread which we\nbreak, _is_ it not the _communion_ of the body of Christ?”[1276] But the\ncommunion of the body is something different from the body itself. In\nalmost all cases of sacraments, we find the same word used—“This _is_ my\ncovenant.” “It _is_ the Lord’s passover.”[1277] And to mention no more,\nwhen Paul says, “That Rock _was_ Christ,”[1278] why do they consider the\nverb substantive less emphatical in that passage than in the speech of\nChrist? Let them also explain the force of the verb substantive in that\nplace where John says, “The Holy Ghost _was_ not yet, because that Jesus\nwas not yet glorified.”[1279] For if they obstinately adhere to their\nrule, they will destroy the eternal existence of the Spirit, as if it\ncommenced at the ascension of Christ. Let them answer, in the last\nplace, what is the meaning of Paul, when he calls baptism “the washing\nof regeneration, and renewing,”[1280] though it is evidently useless to\nmany. But nothing is more conclusive against them than that passage\nwhere Paul says, that the Church is Christ. For having drawn a\nsimilitude from the human body, he adds, “So also is Christ;”[1281] by\nwhich he means not the only begotten Son of God, in himself, but in his\nmembers. I think I have so far succeeded, that all men of sense and\nintegrity must be disgusted with the foul calumnies of our adversaries,\nwhen they charge us with giving no credit to the words of Christ, which\nwe receive with as much submission as themselves, and consider with\ngreater reverence. Indeed, their supine negligence is a proof that it is\na subject of little concern to them, what was the will or meaning of\nChrist, provided they can use him as a shield to defend their obstinacy;\nas our diligence in inquiring into Christ’s true meaning is a sufficient\nproof of our high regard to his authority. They maliciously represent,\nthat human reason prevents us from believing what Christ himself has\ndeclared with his sacred mouth; but how unjustly they stigmatize us with\nthis reproach, I have explained, in a great measure, already, and shall\npresently make still more evident. Nothing prevents us, therefore, from\nbelieving Christ when he speaks, and immediately acquiescing in every\nword he utters. The only question is, whether it be criminal to inquire\ninto his genuine meaning.\nXXIII. To show themselves men of letters, these good doctors prohibit\neven the least departure from the literal signification. I reply, When\nthe Scripture calls God “a man of war,” because this language would be\ntoo harsh, unless it be explained in a figurative sense, I hesitate not\nto consider it as a comparison borrowed from men. And indeed it was upon\nno other pretext that the ancient Anthropomorphites molested the\northodox fathers, than by laying hold of such expressions as these: “The\neyes of the Lord behold; It entereth into the ears of the Lord; His hand\nis stretched out; The earth is his footstool;” and accusing them of\ndepriving God of his body, which the Scripture ascribes to him. If this\ncanon of interpretation be admitted, all the light of faith will be\noverwhelmed in the crudest barbarism. For what monstrous absurdities\nwill not fanatics be able to elicit from the Scripture, if they are\npermitted to allege every detached and ill-understood word and syllable\nin confirmation of their notions? The objection which they urge, from\nthe improbability that Christ, when he was preparing peculiar\nconsolation for his disciples in seasons of adversity, should express\nhimself in enigmatical or obscure language, is completely in our favour.\nFor if it had not been understood by the apostles, that the bread was\ncalled his body in a figurative sense, because it was a symbol of his\nbody, they would undoubtedly have been disturbed about so monstrous a\ndeclaration. Almost at the same moment, John states that they were\nembarrassed and perplexed with every minute difficulty. They who debated\namong themselves how Christ was to go to the Father, and were at a loss\nto know how he would depart from this world; who could understand\nnothing that was said of a heavenly Father, because they had not seen\nhim; how could they have been so ready to believe any thing so entirely\nrepugnant to every dictate of reason, as that Christ was sitting at the\ntable before their eyes, and yet was invisibly enclosed in the bread? By\neating the bread without any hesitation, they testified their consent,\nand hence it appears that they understood the words of Christ in the\nsame sense that we do, considering that it is common in all sacraments\nfor the name of the sign to be transferred to the thing signified. To\nthe disciples, therefore, it was, as it is to us, a certain and clear\nconsolation, involved in no enigma; nor is there any other cause to be\nassigned why some reject our interpretation, except that the devil has\nblinded them by his delusions, in consequence of which they imagine\nenigmatical obscurities, where a beautiful figure furnishes such an\nobvious and natural meaning. Besides, if we rigidly adhere to the\nletter, what Christ said of the bread would be inconsistent with what he\nsaid of the cup. He calls the bread _his body_, he calls the wine _his\nblood_: either this must be a vain repetition, or a distinction which\nseparates the body from the blood. It might be said of the cup, This is\nmy body, as truly as of the bread; and the converse of this proposition\nwould be equally correct, that the bread is his blood. If they reply,\nthat we ought to consider for what end or use the symbols were\ninstituted,—this I acknowledge; but it is impossible to free their error\nfrom this absurd consequence, that the bread is the blood, and the wine\nthe body. Now I am at a loss how to understand them, when they admit the\nbread and the body to be different things, and yet assert that the bread\nis properly and without any figure called the body; as if any one should\nsay that a garment is different from a man, and yet that it is properly\ncalled a man. At the same time, as if their victory consisted in\nobstinacy and calumny, they charge us with accusing Christ of falsehood,\nif we inquire into the true meaning of his words. Now it will be easy\nfor the readers to judge how unjustly we are treated by these\nsyllable-hunters, when they persuade the simple to believe that we\nderogate from the authority due to the words of Christ, which we have\nproved to be outrageously perverted and confounded by them, but to be\nfaithfully and accurately explained by us.\nXXIV. But the infamy of this falsehood cannot be entirely effaced,\nwithout repelling another calumny; for they accuse us of being so\ndevoted to human reason, as to limit the power of God by the order of\nnature, and to allow him no more than our own understanding teaches us\nto ascribe to him. Against such iniquitous aspersions I appeal to the\ndoctrine which I have maintained; which will sufficiently evince that I\nam far from measuring this mystery by the capacity of human reason, or\nsubjecting it to the laws of nature. Is it from natural philosophy that\nwe have learned that Christ feeds our souls with his flesh from heaven,\njust as our bodies are nourished with bread and wine? Whence is it that\nflesh has the power of giving life to our souls? Every one will\npronounce it not to be from nature. No more will it accord with human\nreason that the flesh of Christ descends to us to become nourishment to\nus. In short, whoever shall understand our doctrine, will be enraptured\nwith admiration of the secret power of God. But these good zealots\ncontrive a miracle, without which God himself, with all his power,\ndisappears from their view. I would again request of my readers a\ndiligent consideration of the nature and tendency of our doctrine,\nwhether it depends on human reason, or on the wings of faith rises above\nthe world and ascends to heaven. We say that Christ descends to us both\nby the external symbol and by his Spirit, that he may truly vivify our\nsouls with the substance of his flesh and blood. He who perceives not\nthat many miracles are comprehended in these few words, is more than\nstupid; for there is nothing more preternatural than for souls to derive\nspiritual and heavenly life from the flesh, which had its origin from\nthe earth, and was subject to death; nothing is more incredible than for\nthings separated from each other by all the distance of heaven and\nearth, notwithstanding that immense local distance, to be not only\nconnected, but united, so that our souls receive nourishment from the\nflesh of Christ. Let these fanatics, then, no longer attempt to render\nus odious by such a foul calumny, as though we, in any respect, limited\nthe infinite power of God; which is either a most stupid mistake, or an\nimpudent falsehood. For the question here respects not what God could\ndo, but what he has chosen to do. We affirm that what pleased him, came\nto pass. It pleased him for Christ to become in all respects like his\nbrethren, sin excepted.[1282] What is the nature of our body? Has it not\nits proper and certain dimensions? is it not contained in some\nparticular place, and capable of being felt and seen? And why, say they,\nmay not God cause the same flesh to occupy many different places, to be\ncontained in no particular place, and to have no form or dimensions? But\nhow can they be so senseless as to require the power of God to cause a\nbody to be a body, and not to be a body, at the same time? It is like\ndemanding of him to cause light to be at once both light and darkness.\nBut he wills light to be light, darkness to be darkness, and flesh to be\nflesh. Whenever it shall be his pleasure, indeed, he will turn darkness\ninto light, and light into darkness; but to require that light and\ndarkness shall no longer be different, is to aim at perverting the order\nof Divine wisdom. Therefore body must be body, spirit must be spirit,\nevery thing must be subject to that law, and retain that condition,\nwhich was fixed by God at its creation. And the condition of a body is\nsuch, that it must occupy one particular place, and have its proper form\nand dimensions. In this condition did Christ assume a body, to which, as\nAugustine observes, “he gave incorruption and glory, but without\ndepriving it of its nature and reality.” The testimony of the Scripture\nis clear—that he ascended to heaven, whence he will come again, in like\nmanner as he was seen to ascend.[1283]\nXXV. They reply, that they have the word in which the will of God is\nclearly revealed; that is, if they be allowed to banish from the Church\nthe gift of interpretation which elucidates the word. I confess that\nthey have the word and quote the letter of Scripture; but just as did\nthe Anthropomorphites in past ages, who represented God to be corporeal;\njust as did Marcion and the Manichæans, who attributed to Christ a\ncelestial or visionary body. For they quoted these texts: “The first man\nis of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.”[1284]\n“Christ made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a\nservant, and was made in the likeness of man.”[1285] These groveling\nsouls imagine that God can have no power, unless the whole order of\nnature be reversed by the monster which they have fabricated in their\nown brains; but this is an attempt to circumscribe God, and to measure\nhis power by the fancies of men. For from what word have they learned\nthat the body of Christ is visible in heaven, and yet is on earth,\nconcealed in an invisible manner under innumerable pieces of bread? They\nwill say that necessity requires this, in order to the body of Christ\nbeing given in the supper. The truth is, that when they had determined\nto conclude, from the language of Christ, that his body was eaten in a\ncarnal manner, carried away with this prejudice, they found it necessary\nto invent that subtlety, which the whole tenor of the Scripture\ncontradicts. That we derogate any thing from the power of God, is so far\nfrom being true, that our doctrine peculiarly tends to magnify it. But\nas they never cease to accuse us of defrauding God of his due honour, by\na rejection of every thing which natural reason finds it difficult to\nbelieve, though promised by the mouth of Christ himself, I repeat the\nanswer which I have lately given, that we consult not natural reason\nrespecting the mysteries of faith, but that, with the placid docility\nand gentleness of spirit recommended by James,[1286] we receive the\ndoctrine which comes down from heaven. Yet, in a point in which they run\ninto a pernicious error, I admit that we pursue a useful moderation. On\nhearing the words of Christ, “This is my body,” they imagine a miracle\nthe most distant from his intention. This notion gives birth to\nprodigious absurdities; but, having already embarrassed themselves by\ntheir foolish precipitation, they plunge themselves into the abyss of\nthe Divine omnipotence, in order to extinguish the light of truth. Hence\nthe haughty presumption, with which they profess to have no wish to know\nhow Christ is concealed under the bread, being content with that\ndeclaration, “This is my body.” We, on the contrary, with equal\nobedience and care, endeavour to ascertain the true meaning of this\npassage, as we do of all others; nor do we, with preposterous eagerness,\ntemerity, and indiscretion, seize the first thought which presents\nitself to our minds, but after diligent meditation we embrace that sense\nwhich the Spirit of God suggests; established in which, we look down\nwith contempt on every opposition made to it by the wisdom of this\nworld; we even impose restraints on our own minds, that they may not\ndare to utter a word of cavil, and keep them humble to prevent their\nmurmuring against the authority of God. Hence has proceeded that\nexposition of the words of Christ, which all, who are but moderately\nversed in the Scripture, know to be agreeable to its invariable usage\nrespecting sacraments. Nor do we esteem it unlawful, in a difficult\ncase, after the example of the holy virgin, to inquire how it can\nbe.[1287]\nXXVI. But as nothing will be more effectual to confirm the faith of true\nbelievers, than a knowledge that the doctrine which we have advanced is\ndrawn from the pure word of God, and rests upon its authority, I will\ndemonstrate this with all possible brevity. It is not from Aristotle,\nbut from the Holy Spirit, that we have learned that the body of Christ,\nsince its resurrection, is limited, and received into heaven till the\nlast day. I am fully aware that our adversaries contemptuously elude the\npassages which are adduced for this purpose.[1288] Whenever Christ\nspeaks of his approaching departure from the world, they reply that this\ndeparture was nothing more than a change of his mortal state. But if\nthis were correct, Christ would not substitute the Holy Spirit to supply\nthe defect of his absence, as they express it, since the Spirit does not\nsucceed to his place, nor does Christ himself descend again from the\nglory of heaven to assume the condition of this mortal life. The advent\nof the Spirit, and the ascension of Christ, are clearly opposed to each\nother; and, therefore, it is impossible for Christ to dwell with us,\naccording to his flesh, in the same manner in which he sends his Spirit.\nBesides, he expressly declares that he shall not always be with his\ndisciples in the world.[1289] This declaration also they think they have\ncompletely explained away, by saying that Christ merely intended that he\nshould not always be poor and mean, and exposed to the necessities of\nthis transitory life. But they are evidently contradicted by the\ncontext, which relates, not to his poverty, or indigence, or any of the\nmiseries of this life, but to his reception of respect and honour. The\nunction performed by the woman displeased the disciples, because they\nthought it an unnecessary and useless expense, bordering on luxury; and,\ntherefore, they wished that the value of the ointment, which they\nconsidered as improperly lavished, had been distributed to the poor.\nChrist said, that he should not always be present to receive such\nhonour. Augustine has given the same explanation of this passage, in the\nfollowing explicit language:—“When Christ said, Me ye have not always\nwith you, he spoke of the presence of his body. For according to his\nmajesty, his providence, and his ineffable and invisible grace, is\naccomplished what he said on another occasion—Lo, I am with you always,\neven to the end of the world; but, with respect to the body, which the\nWord assumed, which was born of the virgin, which was apprehended by the\nJews, which was affixed to the tree, which was taken down from the\ncross, which was wrapped in linen clothes, which was laid in the\nsepulchre, which was manifested at the resurrection, this declaration is\nfulfilled—Me ye have not always with you. Why? Because in his corporeal\npresence he conversed with his disciples for forty days, and while they\nwere attending him, seen, but not followed by them, he ascended to\nheaven. He is not here; for he sits at the right hand of the Father: and\nyet he is here; for he has not withdrawn the presence of his majesty:\notherwise, according to the presence of his majesty, we have Christ\nalways with us; but, with respect to his corporeal presence, he said\nwith truth, Me ye have not always with you. For the Church had his\nbodily presence for a few days; now it retains him by faith, but does\nnot behold him with corporeal eyes.” Here let us briefly remark, this\nfather represents Christ as present with us in three respects—in his\nmajesty, his providence, and his ineffable grace; under the last of\nwhich I comprehend the wonderful communion of his body and blood; only\nwe must understand this to be effected by the power of the Holy Spirit,\nand not by a fictitious enclosure of his body under the bread. For our\nLord has declared that he has flesh and bones, capable of being felt and\nseen; and _to go away_ and _to ascend_ import not a mere appearance of\nascent and departure, but an actual performance of that which the words\nexpress. Shall we, then, it will be said by some, assign to Christ a\nparticular district of heaven? I reply, with Augustine, that this\nquestion is too curious, and altogether unnecessary; provided we believe\nthat he is in heaven, that is enough.\nXXVII. Does not the term _ascension_, which is so frequently repeated,\nsignify a removal from one place to another? This they deny, because\nthey consider his exaltation as only denoting the majesty of his empire.\nBut I ask, What was the manner of his ascent? Was he not carried up on\nhigh in the view of his disciples? Do not the evangelists expressly\nstate that he was received up into heaven?[1290] These acute sophists\nreply that he was concealed from their sight by an interposing cloud, to\nteach believers that thenceforward he would not be visible in the world.\nAs though, to produce a belief of his invisible presence, he ought not\nrather to have vanished in a moment, or to have been enveloped in the\ncloud without moving from where he stood. But as he was carried up into\nthe air, and, by the interposition of a cloud between him and his\ndisciples, showed that he was no longer to be sought for on earth, we\nconfidently conclude that his residence is now in heaven. This also is\naffirmed by Paul, who teaches us to expect him from thence.[1291] For\nthis reason the angels admonished the disciples—“Why stand ye gazing up\ninto heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,\nshall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”[1292]\nHere also the adversaries of sound doctrine have recourse to what they\nthink an ingenious evasion—that he will then become visible who has\nnever departed from the world, but remained invisible with his people.\nAs though the angels, in that address, insinuated a twofold presence,\nand did not simply make the disciples ocular witnesses of his ascension,\nwith a view to preclude every doubt; just as if they had said, Received\nup into heaven in your sight, he has taken possession of the celestial\nempire; it remains for you to wait with patience till he shall come\nagain as the judge of the world; for he is now entered into heaven, not\nto occupy it alone, but to assemble you and all the godly to enjoy it\nwith him.\nXXVIII. As the advocates of this spurious doctrine are not ashamed to\ndefend it by the suffrages of the fathers, and particularly of\nAugustine, I will briefly expose the disingenuousness of this attempt.\nTheir testimonies having been collected by learned and pious writers, I\nhave no inclination to go over the same ground; any one who wishes may\nconsult their writings. Nor even from Augustine shall I adduce every\npassage which would serve the argument; but shall content myself with\nshowing, by a few extracts, that he is, beyond all doubt, perfectly in\nharmony with us. In order to deprive us of him, our adversaries allege\nthat, in various parts of his works, he states the flesh and blood of\nChrist, even the victim once offered on the cross, to be dispensed in\nthe sacred supper; but this is altogether frivolous; since he also calls\nthe consecrated symbols either “the eucharist,” or “the sacrament of\nChrist’s body and blood.” But in what sense he uses the words _flesh_\nand _blood_, it is unnecessary to make any long or circuitous inquiry;\nfor he explains himself by saying, “that sacraments take their names\nfrom the similitude of those things which they signify, and, therefore,\nin some sense, the sacrament of the body is _the body_.” With this\ncorresponds another well known passage: “The Lord hesitated not to say,\nThis is my body, when he delivered the sign of it.” They object again,\nthat Augustine expressly says, that the body of Christ falls to the\nearth, and enters into the mouth. I reply, that he says this in the same\nsense in which he affirms it to be consumed; because he connects both\nthese things together. Nor does any objection arise from his saying,\nthat when the mystery is finished, the bread is consumed; because he had\njust before said, “As these things are known to man, being done by man,\nthey may have honour as holy things, but not as miracles.” And to the\nsame effect is another expression, which our adversaries, without\nsufficient consideration, represent as in their favour; that, “when\nChrist presented the mystical bread to his disciples, he, in a certain\nsense, held himself in his own hands.” For, by introducing this\nqualifying phrase _in a certain sense_, he sufficiently declares that\nthe body of Christ was not truly or really enclosed in the bread. Nor\nought this to be thought strange, for in another place he expressly\nmaintains, “That if bodies be deprived of their local spaces, they will\nbe nowhere, and consequently will cease to have any existence.” It is a\npoor cavil, to say that this passage does not relate to the sacred\nsupper, in which God exerts a special power; because the question had\nbeen agitated respecting the body of Christ, and this holy father,\nprofessedly answering it, says, “Christ has given immortality to his\nbody, but has not deprived it of its nature. In a corporeal form,\ntherefore, he is not to be considered as universally diffused; for we\nmust beware of asserting his Divinity in such a way as to destroy the\ntruth of his body. It does not follow, that, because God is every where,\nall that is in him is every where also.” The reason is immediately\nadded—“For one person is God and man, and both constitute one Christ; as\nGod, he is every where; as man, he is in heaven.” What stupidity would\nit have betrayed not to except the mystery of the supper, a thing so\nserious and important, if it contained any thing inconsistent with the\ndoctrine he was maintaining! Yet, if any one will attentively read what\nfollows, he will find, that under that general doctrine, the Lord’s\nsupper is also comprehended. He says, that Christ, who is, in one\nperson, the only begotten Son of God and the Son of man, is every where\npresent as God; that, as God, he resides in the temple of God, that is,\nin the Church; and yet that he occupies some particular place in heaven,\naccording to the dimensions of a real body. To unite Christ with his\nChurch, we see he does not bring down his body from heaven; which he\ncertainly would have done, if that body could not become our food\nwithout being enclosed under the bread. In another place, describing how\nChrist is now possessed by believers, he says, “You have him by the sign\nof the cross, by the sacrament of baptism, by the food and drink of the\naltar.” Whether he is correct in placing a superstitious ceremony among\nthe symbols of Christ’s presence, I am not now discussing; but in\ncomparing the presence of the flesh to the sign of the cross, he\nsufficiently shows that he does not imagine Christ to have two bodies,\none visibly seated in heaven, and the other invisibly concealed under\nthe bread. If any further explication be necessary, it is soon after\nadded, “That we always have Christ, according to the presence of his\nmajesty; but that, according to the presence of his flesh, it is rightly\nsaid, Me ye have not always.” Our adversaries reply, that it is also\nobserved, at the same time, “that according to his ineffable and\ninvisible grace, his declaration is fulfilled—Lo, I am with you always,\neven to the end of the world.” But this is nothing in their favour,\nbecause, after all, it is restricted to that majesty which is always\nopposed to the body, and his flesh is expressly distinguished from his\npower and grace. In another passage of this author, we find the same\nantithesis, or contrast, “that Christ left his disciples in his\ncorporeal presence, that he might be with them by his spiritual\npresence;” which clearly distinguishes the substance of the flesh from\nthe power of the Spirit, which conjoins us with Christ, notwithstanding\nwe are widely separated from him by local distance. He frequently uses\nthe same mode of expression, as when he says, “Christ will come again,\nin his corporeal presence, to judge the living and the dead, according\nto the rule of faith and sound doctrine. For in his spiritual presence,\nhe was to come to his disciples, and to be with his whole Church on\nearth, to the end of time. This discourse, therefore, was addressed to\nthe believers, whom he had already begun to keep with his corporeal\npresence, and whom he was about to leave by his corporeal absence, that\nwith the Father he might keep them by his spiritual presence.” To\nexplain _corporeal_ to mean _visible_, is mere trifling; for he opposes\nthe body of Christ to his Divine power; and by adding, “that _with the\nFather he might keep them_,” clearly expresses that the Saviour\ncommunicates his grace to us from heaven by the Holy Spirit.\nXXIX. As they place so much confidence in this subterfuge of an\ninvisible presence, let us see how far it serves their cause. In the\nfirst place, they cannot produce a single syllable from the Scriptures\nto prove that Christ is invisible; but they take for granted, what no\nman of sound judgment will concede to them, that the body of Christ\ncannot be given in the supper, without being concealed under the form of\nbread. Now, so far is this from being an admitted axiom, that it is the\nvery point in dispute between them and us. And while they talk in this\nway, they are constrained to attribute to Christ a double body, because,\nupon their principle, he is visible in heaven, and at the same time, by\na special dispensation, is invisible in the sacred supper. Whether this\nis correct or not, it is easy to judge from various passages of\nScripture, and particularly from the testimony of Peter; who says of\nChrist, that “the heavens must receive him, until the times of\nrestitution of all things.”[1293] These men maintain that he is in all\nplaces, but without any form. They object that it is unreasonable to\nsubject the nature of a glorified body to the laws of common nature. But\nthis objection leads to the extravagant notion of Servetus, which justly\ndeserves the detestation of all believers, that the body of Christ,\nafter his ascension, was absorbed in his Divinity. I will not assert,\nthat they hold this opinion; but if it be considered as one of the\nattributes of the glorified body, to fill all places in an invisible\nmanner, it is evident that the corporeal substance must be destroyed,\nand no difference will be left between the Divinity and the humanity.\nBesides, if the body of Christ be multiform and variable, so as to\nappear in one place, and to be invisible in another, what becomes of the\nnature of a body which consists in having its proper dimensions? and\nwhere is its unity? With far greater propriety Tertullian argues, that\nthe body of Christ was a true and natural body, because the emblem of it\nis presented to us in the mystery of the supper, as a pledge and\nassurance of spiritual life. And, indeed, it was of his glorified body,\nthat Christ said, “Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and\nbones, as ye see me have.”[1294] We see how the truth of his body is\nproved by the lips of Christ himself, because it can be felt and seen;\ndeprive it of these qualities, and it will cease to be a body. They are\nalways recurring to their subterfuge of the dispensation which they have\ninvented. But it is our duty to receive what Christ absolutely declares,\nin such a manner, as to admit, without any exception, whatever he is\npleased to affirm. He proved that he was not a phantom, because he was\nvisible in his flesh. If that be taken away which he asserts to belong\nto the nature of his body, will it not be necessary to frame a new\ndefinition of a body? Now, with all their sophistry, they can extract\nnothing to support their imaginary _dispensation_ from that passage of\nPaul, where he says, that “From heaven we look for the Saviour, who\nshall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his\nglorious body.”[1295] For we cannot hope for a conformity to Christ in\nthose qualities which they attribute to him, which would make all our\nbodies invisible and infinite; nor will they find a man foolish enough\nto be persuaded to believe so great an absurdity. Let them, then, no\nlonger ascribe to the glorified body of Christ the property of being in\nmany places at once, or of being contained within no particular space.\nIn short, let them either deny the resurrection of the flesh, or admit\nthat Christ, though clothed with celestial glory, has not divested\nhimself of his flesh; for he will make us, in our flesh, partakers of\nthe same glory, as we shall enjoy a resurrection similar to his. For\nwhat is there more clearly stated in any part of the Scripture, than\nthat as Christ really assumed our flesh when he was born of the virgin,\nand suffered in our flesh to atone for our sins, so he resumed the same\nflesh, at his resurrection, and carried it up into heaven? For all the\nhope that we have of our resurrection and ascension to heaven, is\nfounded on the resurrection and ascension of Christ; who, as Tertullian\nsays, “has taken the pledge of our resurrection into heaven with him.”\nNow, how weak and faint would this hope be, if the real flesh of Christ\nhad not truly risen from the dead, and entered into the kingdom of\nheaven! But it is essential to a real body, to have its particular form\nand dimensions, and to be contained within some certain space. Let us\nhear no more, then, of this ridiculous notion, which fastens the minds\nof men, and Christ himself, to the bread. For what is the use of this\ninvisible presence concealed under the bread, but to lead those who\ndesire to be united to Christ, to confine their attention to that\nsymbol? But the Lord intended to withdraw, not only our eyes, but all\nour senses, from the earth, when he forbade the woman to touch him,\nbecause he was not yet ascended to his Father.[1296] When he saw Mary,\nwith pious affection and reverence, hastening to kiss his feet, there\nwas no reason for his disapprobation and prohibition of such an act,\nbefore his ascension to heaven, except that heaven was the only place\nwhere he chose to be sought. It is objected, that he was afterwards seen\nby Stephen;[1297] but the answer is easy; for, in order to this, no\nchange of place was necessary to Christ, who could impart to the eyes of\nhis servant a supernatural perspicacity, capable of penetrating into\nheaven. The same observation is applicable to his appearance to\nPaul.[1298] They allege that Christ came out of the sepulchre, while the\nsepulchre remained closed, and entered into the room where his disciples\nwere assembled, while the doors continued shut; but this contributes no\nsupport to their error. For as the water was like a solid pavement,\nforming a road for Christ when he walked on the lake, so it is no wonder\nif the hardness of the stone gave way, to make him a passage; though it\nis more probable that the stone removed at his command, and after his\ndeparture returned to its place. And to enter while the doors remained\nshut, does not imply his penetrating through the solid matter, but his\nopening an entrance for himself by his Divine power, so that, in a\nmiraculous manner, he instantaneously stood in the midst of his\ndisciples, though the doors were shut. What they adduce from Luke, that\n“he vanished out of the sight” of his two disciples, with whom he had\nwalked to Emmaus,[1299] is of no service to their cause, but is in\nfavour of ours; for, according to the testimony of the same evangelist,\nwhen he joined these disciples, he assumed no new appearance in order to\nconceal himself; but “their eyes were holden, that they should not know\nhim.”[1300] Our adversaries, however, not only transform Christ, to keep\nhim in the world, but they represent him as unlike himself, and\naltogether different on earth from what he is in heaven. By such\nextravagances, in short, they turn the body of Christ into a spirit,\nthough not by positive assertion, yet by direct implication; and not\ncontent with this, they attribute to it qualities utterly incompatible\nwith each other; whence it follows, of necessity, that he must have two\nbodies.\nXXX. Though we should grant them what they contend for, respecting its\ninvisible presence, still this would be no proof of its infinity,\nwithout which it will be a vain attempt to enclose Christ under the\nbread. Unless the body of Christ be capable of being every where at\nonce, without any limitation of place, it will not be credible that it\nis concealed under the bread in the sacred supper. It was this necessity\nwhich caused them to introduce their monstrous notion of its ubiquity.\nBut it has been shown, by clear and strong testimonies of Scripture,\nthat the body of Christ was, like other human bodies, circumscribed by\ncertain dimensions; and its ascension to heaven made it evident that it\nwas not in all places, but that it left one place, when it removed to\nanother. Nor is the promise, “I am with you always, even unto the end of\nthe world,”[1301] to be applied, as they suppose it should be, to his\nbody. In the first place, on this supposition, there will be no such\nperpetual connection, unless Christ dwells in us in a corporeal manner,\nwithout the use of the sacramental supper; and therefore they have no\nsufficient cause for contending so fiercely respecting the words of\nChrist, in order to enclose Christ under the bread. In the next place,\nthe context evinces, that Christ there has not the most distant\nreference to his flesh, but promises his disciples invincible aid to\nsustain and defend them against all the assaults of Satan and the world.\nFor having assigned them a difficult province, to encourage them to\nundertake it without hesitation, and to discharge it with undaunted\nresolution, he supports them with the assurance of his presence; as\nthough he had said, they should never want his aid, which nothing could\novercome. Unless these men wished to involve every thing in confusion,\nought they not to distinguish the nature of this presence? It is evident\nthat some persons would rather incur the greatest disgrace by betraying\ntheir ignorance, than relinquish even the least particle of their error.\nI speak not of the Romanists, whose doctrine is more tolerable, or at\nleast more modest; but some are so carried away with the heat of\ncontention, as to affirm that, on account of the union of the two\nnatures in Christ, wherever his Divinity is, his flesh, which cannot be\nseparated from it, is there also; as if that union had mingled the two\nnatures so as to form some intermediate kind of being, which is neither\nGod nor man. This notion was maintained by Eutyches, and since his time\nby Servetus. But it is clearly ascertained from the Scriptures, that in\nthe one person of Christ the two natures are united in such a manner,\nthat each retains its peculiar properties undiminished. That Eutyches\nwas justly condemned as a heretic, our adversaries will not deny; it is\nsurprising that they overlook the cause of his condemnation, which was,\nthat by taking away the difference between the two natures, and\ninsisting on the unity of the person, he made the Divinity human, and\ndeified the humanity. What absurdity, therefore, is it to mingle heaven\nand earth together, rather than not to draw the body down from the\ncelestial sanctuary! They endeavour to justify themselves by adducing\nthese texts: “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down\nfrom heaven, even the Son of man, which is in heaven;” and, “The only\nbegotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared\nhim.”[1302] But it argues the same stupidity to disregard the\ncommunication of properties, a term which was with good reason adopted\nby the holy fathers in the early ages. When Paul says that “The Lord of\nglory” was “crucified,”[1303] he certainly does not intend that Christ\nsuffered any thing in his Divinity, but that the same person, who\nsuffered as an abject and despised man, was also, as God, the Lord of\nglory. In the same sense, the Son of man was in heaven; because the same\nChrist, who, according to the flesh, dwelt on earth as the Son of man,\nas God, was always in heaven. For this reason, in the same passage, he\nrepresents himself as having descended from heaven, according to his\nDivinity; not that his Divinity quitted heaven to confine itself in the\nprison of the body; but because, though it filled all space, yet it\ndwelt corporeally, or naturally, and in a certain ineffable manner, in\nthe humanity. It is a distinction common in the schools, and which I am\nnot ashamed to repeat, that though Christ is every where entire, yet all\nthat is in him is not every where. And I sincerely wish that the\nschoolmen themselves had duly considered the meaning of this\nobservation; for then we should never have heard of their stupid notion\nof the corporeal presence of Christ in the sacrament. Therefore, our\nMediator, as he is every where entire, is always near to his people; and\nin the sacred supper exhibits himself present in a peculiar manner, yet\nnot with all that belongs to him; because, as we have stated, his body\nhas been received into heaven, and remains there till he shall come to\njudgment.\nXXXI. They are exceedingly deceived, who cannot conceive of any presence\nof the flesh of Christ in the supper, except it be attached to the\nbread. For on this principle they leave nothing to the secret operation\nof the Spirit, which unites us to Christ. They suppose Christ not to be\npresent, unless he descends to us; as though we cannot equally enjoy his\npresence, if he elevates us to himself. The only question between us,\ntherefore, respects the manner of this presence; because they place\nChrist in the bread, and we think it unlawful for us to bring him down\nfrom heaven. Let the readers judge on which side the truth lies. Only\nlet us hear no more of that calumny, that Christ is excluded from the\nsacrament, unless he be concealed under the bread. For as this is a\nheavenly mystery, there is no necessity to bring Christ down to the\nearth, in order to be united to us.\nXXXII. If any one inquire of me respecting the manner, I shall not be\nashamed to acknowledge, that it is a mystery too sublime for me to be\nable to express, or even to comprehend; and, to be still more explicit,\nI rather experience it, than understand it. Here, therefore, without any\ncontroversy, I embrace the truth of God, on which I can safely rely. He\npronounces his flesh to be the food, and his blood the drink, of my\nsoul. I offer him my soul, to be nourished with such aliment. In his\nsacred supper, he commands me, under the symbols of bread and wine, to\ntake, and eat, and drink, his body and blood. I doubt not that he truly\npresents, and that I receive them. Only I reject the absurdities which\nappear to be either degrading to his majesty, or inconsistent with the\nreality of his human nature, and are at the same time repugnant to the\nword of God, which informs us that Christ has been received into the\nglory of the celestial kingdom, where he is exalted above every\ncondition of the world, and which is equally careful to attribute to his\nhuman nature the properties of real humanity. Nor ought this to seem\nincredible or unreasonable, because, as the kingdom of Christ is wholly\nspiritual, so his communications with his Church are not at all to be\nregulated by the order of the present world; or, to use the words of\nAugustine, “This mystery, as well as others, is celebrated by man, but\nin a Divine manner; it is administered on earth, but in a heavenly\nmanner.” The presence of Christ’s body, I say, is such as the nature of\nthe sacrament requires; where we affirm that it appears with so much\nvirtue and efficacy, as not only to afford our minds an undoubted\nconfidence of eternal life, but also to give us an assurance of the\nresurrection and immortality of our bodies. For they are vivified by his\nimmortal flesh, and in some degree participate his immortality. Those\nwho go beyond this in their hyperbolical representations, merely obscure\nthe simple and obvious truth by such intricacies. If any person be not\nyet satisfied, I would request him to consider, that we are now treating\nof a sacrament, every part of which ought to be referred to faith. Now,\nwe feed our faith by this participation of the body of Christ which we\nhave mentioned, as fully as they do, who bring him down from heaven. At\nthe same time, I candidly confess, that I reject that mixture of the\nflesh of Christ with our souls, or that transfusion of it into us, which\nthey teach; because it is sufficient for us that Christ inspires life\ninto our souls from the substance of his flesh, and even infuses his own\nlife into us, though his flesh never actually enters into us. I may also\nremark, that the analogy of faith, to which Paul directs us to conform\nevery interpretation of the Scripture, is in this case, beyond all\ndoubt, eminently in our favour. Let the adversaries of so clear a truth\nexamine by what rule of faith they regulate themselves. “He that\nconfesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of\nGod.”[1304] Such persons, though they may conceal it, or may not observe\nit, do, in effect, deny the reality of his flesh.\nXXXIII. The same judgment is to be formed of our participation, which\nthey suppose not to be enjoyed at all, unless the flesh of Christ be\nswallowed in the bread. But we do no small injury to the Holy Spirit,\nunless we believe that our communion with the flesh and blood of Christ\nis the effect of his incomprehensible influence. Even if the virtue of\nthis mystery, such as we have represented it, and as it was understood\nby the ancient Church, had received the consideration justly due to it,\nfor four hundred years past, there would have been quite enough to\nsatisfy us, and the door would have been shut against many pernicious\nerrors, which have kindled dreadful dissensions, by which the Church has\nbeen miserably agitated in the present, as well as past ages. But\nsophistical men insist on a hyperbolical kind of presence, which is\nnever taught in the Scripture; and they contend as eagerly for this\nfoolish and absurd imagination, as if the whole of religion consisted in\nthe enclosure of Christ in the bread. It principally concerns us to know\nhow the body of Christ, which was once delivered for us, is made ours,\nand how we are made partakers of his blood which was shed; for the\nentire possession of Christ crucified consists in an enjoyment of all\nhis benefits. Now, leaving these things, which are of such great\nimportance, and even neglecting and forgetting them, these sophists take\nno pleasure but in this thorny question; how the body of Christ is\nconcealed under the bread, or under the form of the bread. They falsely\npretend that all that we teach respecting a spiritual participation, is\ncontrary to what they call the true and real participation; because we\nregard nothing but the manner, which, in their opinion, is corporeal, as\nthey enclose Christ in the bread, but in ours is spiritual, because the\nsecret influence of the Spirit is the bond which unites us to Christ.\nNor is there any more truth in their other objection, that we attend to\nnothing but the fruit or effect which believers experience from feeding\non the flesh of Christ. For we have already said, that Christ himself is\nthe matter or substance of the sacred supper, and that it is in\nconsequence of this, that we are absolved from our sins by the sacrifice\nof his death, are washed in his blood, and by his resurrection are\nraised to the hope of the heavenly life. But the foolish imagination, of\nwhich Lombard was the author, has perverted their minds, while they have\nsupposed the sacrament to consist in eating the flesh of Christ. For\nthese are his words: “The sacrament, without the thing, consists in the\nforms of bread and wine; the sacrament and the thing are the flesh and\nblood of Christ; the thing, without the sacrament, is his mystical\nflesh.” Again, a little after: “The thing signified and contained is the\nproper flesh of Christ; the thing signified and not contained, is his\nmystical body.” With his distinction between the flesh of Christ, and\nthe power which it has to nourish, I fully agree; but his notion, of\nwhat is a sacrament, and as contained under the bread, is an error not\nto be endured. Hence proceeded a false idea of sacramental eating,\nbecause they supposed the body of Christ to be eaten by impious and\nprofane persons, notwithstanding they were strangers to him. But the\nflesh of Christ itself, in the mystery of the supper, is as much a\nspiritual thing, as our eternal salvation. Whence we conclude, that\npersons who are destitute of the Spirit of Christ, can no more eat the\nflesh of Christ, than drink wine which has no taste. It is certainly\noffering an insult, and doing violence to Christ, to attribute to him a\nbody all feeble and dead, which is promiscuously distributed to\nunbelievers; and it is expressly contradicted by his own words: “He that\neateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in\nhim.”[1305] They reply, that the discourse from which this text is\nquoted does not treat of sacramental eating; and this I concede to them;\nonly let them not be perpetually striking on the same rock, that the\nflesh of Christ may be eaten without any benefit. But I would wish them\nto inform me how long they retain it after they have eaten it. Here I\nbelieve they will find it impossible to escape. But they object, that\nthe truth of the promises of God can sustain no diminution or failure\nfrom the ingratitude of men. This I admit; and I also maintain, that the\nvirtue of this mystery remains unimpaired, notwithstanding wicked men\nexert their utmost efforts to destroy it. It is one thing, however, for\nthe body of Christ to be offered, and another for it to be received.\nChrist presents this spiritual meat and spiritual drink to all; some\nreceive them with avidity, others fastidiously reject them; shall their\nrejection cause the meat and drink to lose their nature? They will\nplead, that their sentiment is supported by this similitude—that the\nflesh of Christ, though it be not relished by unbelievers, nevertheless\nstill continues to be flesh. But I deny that it can ever be eaten\nwithout the taste of faith; or, if the language of Augustine be\npreferred, I deny that men carry away from the sacrament any more than\nthey collect in the vessel of faith. Thus, nothing is taken from the\nsacrament, but its truth and efficacy remain unimpaired, notwithstanding\nthe wicked depart empty from its external participation. If our\nadversaries object again, that it derogates from these words, “This is\nmy body,” if the wicked receive corruptible bread, and nothing more, the\nanswer is easy—That God will have his veracity discovered, not in the\nreception itself, but in the constancy of his goodness, since he is\nready to impart to the unworthy, and even liberally offers to them, that\nwhich they reject. And this is the perfection of the sacrament, which\nthe whole world cannot violate, that the flesh and blood of Christ are\nas truly given to the unworthy, as to the elect and faithful people of\nGod; but it is likewise true, that as rain, falling upon a hard rock,\nruns off from it without penetrating into the stone, thus the wicked, by\ntheir obduracy, repel the grace of God, so that it does not enter into\ntheir hearts. Besides, a reception of Christ, without faith, is as great\nan absurdity, as for seed to germinate in the fire. Their inquiry, how\nChrist came for condemnation to some, unless they receive him\nunworthily, is a groundless cavil; for we nowhere read that the\nperdition of man is owing to an unworthy reception of Christ, but rather\nto a rejection of him. Nor can they derive any assistance from the\nparable in which Christ speaks of some seed springing up among thorns,\nand being afterwards choked and destroyed; for he is there showing what\nvalue belongs to that temporary faith, which our adversaries suppose to\nbe unnecessary to a participation of the flesh and blood of Christ,\nplacing Judas, in this respect, on an equality with Peter. Their error\nis rather refuted by another part of the same parable, in which Christ\nspeaks of some seed as having fallen by the way-side, and some on stony\nground, neither of which took any root.[1306] Whence it follows, that\nthe obduracy of unbelievers is such an obstacle, that Christ does not\nreach them. Whoever desires our salvation to be promoted by this\nmystery, will find nothing more proper than that believers, conducted to\nthe fountain should derive life from the Son of God. But the dignity of\nit is sufficiently magnified, when we remember, that it is a medium by\nwhich we are incorporated into Christ; or by which, after our\nincorporation into him, the connection is more and more strengthened,\ntill he perfectly unites us with himself, in the heavenly life. They\nobject, that Paul ought not to have made unbelievers “guilty of the body\nand blood of the\nLord,”[1307] unless they had been partakers of them. But I answer, that\nthey are not condemned for having eaten and drunk his body and blood,\nbut only for having profaned the mystery, by trampling under foot the\npledge of our holy union with God, which ought to have been received by\nthem with reverence.\nXXXIV. Now, because Augustine is the principal among the ancient fathers\nwho has asserted this point of doctrine, that the sacraments sustain no\ndiminution, and that the grace which they represent is not frustrated by\nthe unbelief or wickedness of men, it will be useful to adduce his own\nwords, which will clearly prove that those who expose the body of Christ\nto be eaten by dogs,[1308] are chargeable with an injudicious and\nculpable perversion of his meaning, in applying it to the present\nargument. Sacramental eating, according to them, is that by which the\nwicked receive the body and blood of Christ without any influence of his\nSpirit, or any effect of his grace. Augustine, on the contrary,\ncarefully examining these words, “Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my\nblood hath eternal life,”[1309] says, “This is the virtue of the\nsacrament, not the mere visible sacrament; and that internally, not\nexternally; he who eats with his heart, and not with his teeth;” from\nwhich he concludes that the sacrament of the union which we have with\nthe body and blood of Christ, is presented in the sacred supper, to some\nto life, to others to perdition; but that the thing signified by the\nsacrament is only given to life to all who partake of it, and in no case\nto perdition. To preclude any cavil here, that the thing signified is\nnot the body, but the grace of the Spirit, which may be separated from\nthe body, he obviates such misrepresentations by the use of the\ncontrasted epithets of _visible_ and _invisible_; for the body of Christ\ncannot be comprehended under the former. Hence it follows, that\nunbelievers receive nothing but the visible symbol. And, for the more\ncomplete removal of every doubt, after having said that this bread\nrequires the hunger of the inner man, he adds, “Moses, and Aaron, and\nPhinehas, and many others who ate the manna, were acceptable to God.\nWhy? Because they spiritually understood the visible food, they\nspiritually hungered, they spiritually ate, that they might be\nspiritually satisfied. For we also, in the present day, have received\nvisible food; but the sacrament is one thing, and the virtue of the\nsacrament is another.” A little after he says, “Therefore he who abides\nnot in Christ, and in whom Christ does not abide, spiritually neither\neats his flesh nor drinks his blood, though he may carnally and visibly\npress the sign of the body and blood with his teeth.” Here, again, we\nfind the visible sign opposed to the spiritual eating; which contradicts\nthat error, that the invisible body of Christ is really eaten\nsacramentally, though it be not eaten spiritually. We are informed also\nthat nothing is granted to the profane and impure, beyond the visible\nreception of the sign. Hence that well known observation of his, that\nthe other disciples ate _the bread which was the Lord_, but that Judas\nmerely ate _the Lord’s bread_; by which he clearly excludes unbelievers\nfrom the participation of the body and blood. And to the same purpose is\nwhat he says in another place: “Why do you wonder if the bread of Christ\nwas given to Judas to enslave him to the devil, when you see, on the\nother hand, that the messenger of Satan was given to Paul to make him\nperfect in Christ?”[1310] He says, indeed, in another place, “That the\nsacramental bread was the body of Christ to those to whom Paul said, He\nthat eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to\nhimself;[1311] and that they could not, therefore, be affirmed to have\nreceived nothing, because they had received amiss.” But his meaning is\nmore fully explained in another passage. For professedly undertaking to\ndescribe how the body of Christ is eaten by the wicked and profligate,\nwho confess the Christian faith with their lips while they deny it in\ntheir actions, and that in opposition to the opinion of some who\nsupposed them to eat not only the sacramental symbol, but the substance\nitself, he says, “They must not be considered as eating the body of\nChrist, because they are not to be numbered among the members of Christ.\nFor, to mention nothing else, they cannot, at the same time, be the\nmembers of Christ and the members of a harlot. And where the Lord\nhimself says, He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth\nin me, and I in him;[1312] he shows what it is to eat his body, not\nmerely in a sacramental way, but in truth; for this is to dwell in\nChrist, that Christ may dwell in us. This is the same as if he had said,\nWhoever dwelleth not in me, and in whom I dwell not, let him not say or\nthink he eateth my body or drinketh my blood.” Let the readers consider\nthe opposition here stated between eating _merely in a sacramental way_,\nand _in truth_, and there will remain no doubt respecting his meaning.\nHe confirms the same with equal perspicuity in the following passage:\n“Prepare not your jaws, but your heart; it is for this that the supper\nis enjoined. Behold, we believe in Christ when we receive him by faith;\nin receiving him, we know what we think; we take a bit of bread, and our\nhearts are satisfied. We are fed, therefore, not by what we see, but by\nwhat we believe.” Here, also, what the wicked partake of he restricts to\nthe visible sign, and pronounces that Christ is only received by faith.\nSo, in another place, he expressly remarks that the good and the wicked\npartake of the elements in common, and excludes the latter from the true\nparticipation of the body of Christ. For, if they had enjoyed the\nsubstance itself, he would not have been entirely silent on that which\nwould have strengthened his argument. In another place also, treating of\nthe eating, and the benefit of it, he concludes thus: “Then will the\nbody and blood of Christ be life to every one, if that which is visibly\nreceived in the sacrament, be, in the truth which is signified,\nspiritually eaten and spiritually drunk.” Let those, therefore, who, in\norder to agree with Augustine, make unbelievers partakers of the flesh\nand blood of Christ, exhibit to us the body of Christ in a visible\nmanner, since he pronounces the whole truth of the sacrament to be\nspiritual. And the evident conclusion from his language is, that the\nsacramental eating is nothing more than eating the visible and external\nsign, when unbelief precludes the entrance of the substance. If the body\nof Christ could be eaten truly, without being eaten spiritually, what\ncould be the meaning of Augustine, when he said, “You are not to eat\nthis body which you see, and to drink the blood which will be shed by\nthose who shall crucify me. I have appointed a sacrament for you;\nspiritually understood, it shall vivify you.” He certainly did not mean\nto deny that the same body which Christ offered in sacrifice is\nexhibited in the supper; but he designates the mode of participating in\nit—that though it has been received into celestial glory, it inspires us\nwith life by the secret influence of the Holy Spirit. I acknowledge that\nhe frequently speaks of the body of Christ as eaten by unbelievers, but\nhe explains his meaning by adding that it is done sacramentally; and, in\nanother place, he describes the spiritual eating as not consisting in a\ncorporeal swallowing of the grace of God. And that my adversaries may\nnot charge me with a wish to overwhelm them by an accumulation of\npassages, I would request them to inform me how they can evade that one\ndeclaration of his, where he says, “that the sacraments realize what\nthey represent in the elect alone.” Surely they will not dare to deny\nthat the bread represents the body of Christ. Hence it follows, that the\nreprobate are excluded from the participation of it. The following\npassage of Cyril also shows him to have been of the same opinion: “As\nwhen any one pours melted wax upon other wax, the whole will be mingled\ntogether into one mass, so it is necessary to any person’s reception of\nthe body and blood of Christ, for him to be united with Christ, so that\nChrist may be found in him, and he in Christ.” These words, I think,\nsufficiently prove, that those who eat the body of Christ merely in a\nsacramental way are deprived of the true and real participation of it,\nas the body itself cannot be separated from its efficacious power; and\nyet that this is no impeachment of the truth of the promises of God, who\nstill continues to send us rain from heaven, though rocks and stones\nimbibe none of the moisture.\nXXXV. This knowledge will also easily dissuade us from the carnal\nadoration which has been introduced into the sacrament by the perverse\ntemerity of some, who reasoned in this manner: If the body be there,\nconsequently the soul and the Divinity are there together with the body,\nfor they cannot be separated from it; therefore Christ ought to be\nadored there. In the first place, what will they do, if we refuse to\nadmit what they call _concomitance_? For, however they may urge the\nabsurdity of separating the soul and the Divinity from the body, what\nman in his senses can be persuaded that the body of Christ is Christ?\nThey consider it, indeed, as fully demonstrated by their arguments. But\nas Christ speaks distinctly of his body and blood, without specifying\nthe nature of the presence, how can they establish what they wish by\nthat which is itself doubtful? What then? If their consciences happen to\nbe exercised with any peculiar affliction, will they not, with all their\nsyllogisms, be confounded and overwhelmed; when they shall perceive\nthemselves to be destitute of the certain word of God, which furnishes\nthe only support for our souls when they are called to give an account,\nand without which they sink in a moment; when they shall reflect that\nthe doctrine and examples of the apostles are against them, and that\nthey are themselves the sole authors of their error? To such reflections\nwill be added other sentiments of compunction, and those by no means\ninconsiderable. What! was it a thing of no consequence to adore God in\nthis form, without any such thing being enjoined upon us? In a case\nwhere the true worship of God was concerned, ought that to have been so\nlightly undertaken, which not a word in the Scripture could be found to\nsanction? But if, with becoming humility, they had kept all their\nthoughts in subjection to the word of God, they would certainly have\nlistened to what Christ said, “Take, eat, drink,” and would have obeyed\nthis command, which enjoins the sacrament to be taken, not to be adored.\nThose who, as the Lord has commanded, receive it without adoration, are\nassured that they do not deviate from the Divine command; and such an\nassurance is the best satisfaction we can have in any thing in which we\nengage. They have the example of the apostles, of whom we read, not that\nthey prostrated themselves in adoration, but that, as they were sitting\nat the table, they took, and did eat. They have the practice of the\napostolic Church, in which Luke states that the communion of believers\nconsisted, not in adoration, but in “the breaking of bread.”[1313] They\nhave the apostolic doctrine with which Paul instructed the Church of the\nCorinthians, accompanying it with this declaration: “I have received of\nthe Lord that which also I delivered unto you.”[1314]\nXXXVI. All these things lead the pious reader to consider how unsafe it\nis, in matters of such importance, to leave the pure word of God for the\nreveries of our own brains. The remarks which have already been made,\nought to relieve our minds from every difficulty on this subject. For,\nin order to a due reception of Christ in the sacrament, it is necessary\nfor pious souls to be elevated to heaven. If it be the design of the\nsacrament to assist the mind of man, which is otherwise weak, that it\nmay be enabled to rise to discover the sublimity of spiritual\nmysteries,—those who confine themselves to the external sign, wander\nfrom the right way of seeking Christ. What, then, shall we deny it to be\na superstitious worship, when men prostrate themselves before a piece of\nbread, to adore Christ in it? There is no doubt that the Council of Nice\nintended to guard against this evil, when it prohibited Christians from\nhaving their attention humbly fixed on the visible signs. And this was\nthe only reason for that custom in the ancient Church, that, before the\nconsecration, one of the deacons should, with an audible voice, admonish\nthe people to have their _hearts above_. The Scripture itself, also, in\naddition to the particular account which it gives us of the ascension of\nChrist, by which he removed his corporeal presence from the view and\nsociety of men, in order to divest us of every carnal idea respecting\nhim, whenever it mentions him, calls us to lift our minds upwards, and\nto seek for him seated “at the right hand of God.”[1315] According to\nthis rule, it was our duty to adore him spiritually in the glory of\nheaven, rather than to invent such a dangerous kind of adoration,\ninvolving such gross and carnal conceptions of God. Wherefore, those who\nhave invented the adoration of the sacrament, have not only dreamed it\nof themselves, without the sanction of the Scripture, in which not the\nleast mention of it can be found, though, if it had been agreeable to\nGod, it would not have been omitted; but even in direct opposition to\nthe Scripture, forsaking the living God, they have fabricated a new\ndeity, according to their own wayward inclinations. For what is\nidolatry, if it be not to worship the gifts instead of the giver\nhimself? In which they have fallen into a double sin; for the honour has\nbeen taken away from God, to be transferred to the creature; and God\nhimself has also been dishonoured by the pollution and profanation of\nhis gift, when his holy sacrament has been made an execrable idol. Let\nus, on the contrary, lest we fall into the same danger, fix our ears,\nour eyes, our minds, and our tongues, entirely on the sacred doctrine of\nGod. For that is the school of the Holy Spirit, the best of all\nteachers; whose instructions require nothing to be added from any other\nquarter, and omit nothing of which we ought not to be willing to remain\nin ignorance.\nXXXVII. Now, as superstition, when it has once gone beyond the proper\nlimits, proceeds in sinning without end, they have wandered still\nfurther; they have invented ceremonies altogether incompatible with the\ninstitution of the sacred supper, for the sole purpose of giving divine\nhonours to the sign. When we remonstrate with them, they reply, that\nthey pay this veneration to Christ. In the first place, if this were\ndone in the supper, I would still say that that is the only legitimate\nadoration, which terminates not in the sign, but is directed to Christ\nenthroned in heaven. Now, what pretence have they for alleging that they\nworship Christ in the bread, when they have no promise of such a thing?\nThey consecrate their _host_, as they call it, to carry it about in\nprocession, to display it in pomp, and to exhibit it in a box, to be\nseen, adored, and invoked by the people. I inquire how they consider it\nto be rightly consecrated. They immediately adduce these words: “This is\nmy body.” I object, that it was said at the same time. “Take and eat.”\nAnd I have sufficient reason for this; for when a promise is annexed to\na precept, it is so included in the precept, that, separated from it, it\nceases to be a promise at all. This shall be further elucidated by a\nsimilar example. The Lord gave a command, when he said, “Call upon me;”\nhe added a promise, “I will deliver thee.”[1316] If any one should\ninvoke Peter or Paul, and boast of this promise, will not his conduct be\nuniversally condemned? And wherein would this differ from the conduct of\nthose who suppress the command to eat, and lay hold of the mutilated\npromise, “This is my body,” in order to misapply it to ceremonies\nforeign from the institution of Christ? Let us remember, then, that this\npromise is given to those who observe the commandment connected with it,\nbut that they are entirely unsupported by the word of God, who transfer\nthe sacrament to any other usage. We have already shown how the mystery\nof the supper promotes our faith before God. But as God here not only\nrecalls to our remembrance the vast exuberance of his goodness, but\ndelivers it, as it were, into our hands, as we have already declared,\nand excites us to acknowledge it, so he also admonishes us not to be\nungrateful for such a profusion of beneficence, but, on the contrary, to\nmagnify it with the praises it deserves, and to celebrate it with\nthanksgivings. Therefore, when he gave the institution of this sacrament\nto the apostles, he said to them, “This do in remembrance of me;”[1317]\nwhich Paul explains to be “showing the Lord’s death;”[1318] that is,\npublicly, and all together, as with one mouth, to confess that all our\nconfidence of life and salvation rests on the death of the Lord; that we\nmay glorify him by our confession, and by our example may exhort others\nto give him the same glory. Here, again, we see the object to which the\nsacrament tends, which is, to exercise us in a remembrance of the death\nof Christ. For the command which we have received, to “show the Lord’s\ndeath till he come” to judgment, is no other than to declare, by the\nconfession of our lips, what our faith has acknowledged in the\nsacrament, that the death of Christ is our life. This is the second use\nof the sacrament, which relates to external confession.\nXXXVIII. In the third place, the Lord intended it to serve us as an\nexhortation, and no other could be better adapted to animate and\ninfluence us in the most powerful manner to purity and sanctity of life,\nas well as to charity, peace, and concord. For there the Lord\ncommunicates his body to us in such a manner that he becomes completely\none with us, and we become one with him. Now, as he has only one body,\nof which he makes us all partakers, it follows, of necessity, that, by\nsuch participation, we also are all made one body; and this union is\nrepresented by the bread which is exhibited in the sacrament. For as it\nis composed of many grains, mixed together in such a manner that one\ncannot be separated or distinguished from another,—in the same manner we\nought, likewise, to be connected and united together, by such an\nagreement of minds, as to admit of no dissension or division between us.\nThis I prefer expressing in the language of Paul: “The cup of blessing\nwhich we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The\nbread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For\nwe, being many, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of\nthat one bread.”[1319] We have derived considerable benefit from the\nsacrament, if this thought be impressed and engraven upon our minds,\nthat it is impossible for us to wound, despise, reject, injure, or in\nany way to offend one of our brethren, but we, at the same time, wound,\ndespise, reject, injure, and offend Christ in him; that we have no\ndiscord with our brethren without being, at the same time, at variance\nwith Christ; that we cannot love Christ without loving him in our\nbrethren; that such care as we take of our own body, we ought to\nexercise the same care of our brethren, who are members of our body;\nthat as no part of our body can be in any pain without every other part\nfeeling correspondent sensations, so we ought not to suffer our brother\nto be afflicted with any calamity without our sympathizing in the same.\nWherefore, it is not without reason that Augustine so frequently calls\nthis sacrament “the bond of charity.” For what more powerful stimulus\ncould be employed to excite mutual charity among us, than when Christ,\ngiving himself to us, not only invites us by his example mutually to\ndevote ourselves to the promotion of one another’s welfare, but also, by\nmaking himself common to all, makes us all to be one with himself?\nXXXIX. This furnishes the best confirmation of what I have stated\nbefore, that there is no true administration of the sacrament without\nthe word. For whatever advantage accrues to us from the sacred supper\nrequires the word; whether we are to be confirmed in faith, exercised in\nconfession, or excited to duty, there is need of preaching. Nothing more\npreposterous, therefore, can be done with respect to the supper, than to\nconvert it into a mute action, as we have seen done under the tyranny of\nthe pope. For they have maintained that all the validity of the\nconsecration depends on the intention of the priests, as if it had\nnothing to do with the people, to whom the mystery ought principally to\nbe explained. They fell into this error, for want of observing that\nthose promises on which the consecration rests, are not directed to the\nelements themselves, but to the persons who receive them. Christ does\nnot address the bread, to command it to become his body; but enjoins his\ndisciples to eat, and promises them the communication of his body and\nblood. Nor does Paul teach any other order than that the promises should\nbe offered to believers, together with the bread and the cup. And this\nis the truth. We are not to imagine any magical incantation, or think it\nsufficient to have muttered over the words, as if they were heard by the\nelements; but we are to understand those words, by which the elements\nare consecrated, to be a lively preaching, which edifies the hearers,\nwhich penetrates their minds, which is deeply impressed upon their\nhearts, which exerts its efficacy in the accomplishment of that which it\npromises. These considerations clearly show that the reservation of the\nsacrament, insisted upon by many persons, for the purpose of\nextraordinary distribution to the sick, is perfectly useless. For either\nthey will receive it without any recital of the institution of Christ,\nor the minister will accompany the sign with a true explication of the\nmystery. If nothing be said, it is an abuse and corruption. If the\npromises are repeated and the mystery declared, that those who are about\nto receive it may communicate with advantage, we have no reason to doubt\nthat this is the true consecration. What end will be answered, then, by\nthe former consecration, which, having been pronounced when the sick\npersons were not present, is of no avail to them? But it will be\nalleged, that those who adopt this practice have the example of the\nancient Church in their favour. This I confess; but in a matter of such\ngreat importance, and in which any error must be highly dangerous, there\nis nothing so safe as to follow the truth itself.\nXL. Now, as we perceive this sacred bread of the Lord’s supper to be\nspiritual food, grateful and delicious as well as salutary to the\nsincere worshippers of God, who, in the participation of it, experience\nChrist to be their life, whom it stimulates to thanksgiving, whom it\nexhorts to mutual charity among themselves; so, on the contrary, it is\nchanged into a most noxious poison to all whose faith it does not\nnourish and confirm, and whom it does not excite to thanksgiving and\ncharity. For as corporeal food, when it offends a diseased stomach,\nbecoming itself corrupted, is found rather noxious than nutritious, so\nthis spiritual food, when it meets with a soul polluted by iniquity,\nonly precipitates it into a more dreadful ruin; not, indeed, from any\nfault in the food, but because “unto them that are defiled and\nunbelieving nothing is pure,”[1320] however it may be otherwise\nsanctified by the blessing of the Lord. For, as Paul says, “He that\neateth and drinketh unworthily is guilty of the body and blood of the\nLord, and eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the\nLord’s body.”[1321] Persons of this description, who, without one\nparticle of faith, or the least feeling of charity, intrude themselves,\nlike so many swine, to seize the supper of the Lord, have no discernment\nof the Lord’s body. For, as they do not believe that body to be their\nlife, they treat it with the utmost dishonour they are capable of\ncasting upon it, robbing it of its dignity, and receiving it in such a\nmanner as to pollute and profane it. And as, amidst their dissension and\nalienation from their brethren, they presume to mingle the sacred symbol\nof Christ’s body with their discords, it is not owing to them that the\nbody of Christ is not divided, and every member severed from the rest.\nTherefore they are justly represented as guilty of the body and blood of\nthe Lord, which they so shamefully pollute with their sacrilegious\nimpiety. By this unworthy eating they receive their own condemnation.\nFor though they have no faith fixed on Christ, yet in their reception of\nthe sacrament they profess that there is no salvation for them any where\nexcept in him, and renounce every other dependence. Wherefore they are\ntheir own accusers; they give testimony against themselves; they seal\ntheir own condemnation. Moreover, while divided and distracted from\ntheir brethren, that is, from the members of Christ, they have no part\nin Christ, yet they testify that the only way of salvation is to\nparticipate of Christ, and to be united to him. For this reason, Paul\ngave the following injunction: “Let a man examine himself, and so let\nhim eat of that bread, and drink of that cup;”[1322] by which, I\napprehend, he meant that every man should retire into himself, and\nconsider whether, with sincere confidence of heart, he relies on the\nsalvation procured by Christ; whether he acknowledges it by the\nconfession of his mouth; whether he aspires after an imitation of Christ\nin the pursuit of integrity and holiness; whether, after the example of\nChrist, he is ready to devote himself to his brethren, and to\ncommunicate himself to them with whom he has a common interest in\nChrist; whether, as he himself is acknowledged by Christ, he in like\nmanner considers all his brethren as members of his body; whether he\ndesires to cherish, preserve, and assist them as his own members. Not\nthat these duties of faith and charity can now be perfect in us; but\nbecause this is the point which we ought to feel the most ardent desires\nand exert the most strenuous efforts to attain, that our faith may be\nmore and more increased, and our charity strengthened from day to day.\nXLI. In general, when they have intended to prepare persons for this\nworthy participation of the sacrament, they have dreadfully harassed and\ntortured miserable consciences, and yet have not mentioned a single\nthing which the case required. They have said that those “eat worthily,”\nwho are in a state of grace. To be in a state of grace, they have\nexplained to consist in being pure and cleansed from all sin—a doctrine\nwhich would exclude all the men who now live, or ever have lived upon\nearth, from the benefit of this sacrament. For if it be necessary for us\nto derive our worthiness from ourselves, we are undone; nothing awaits\nus but ruin, confusion, and despair. Though we strive with all our\npowers, we shall gain nothing, at last, but a discovery that we are most\nunworthy, after having laboured to the utmost to find some worthiness.\nTo heal this wound, they have contrived a method of attaining\nworthiness; which is, that having, as far as we can, examined our\nconsciences, and required from ourselves an account of all our actions,\nwe should purge ourselves from our unworthiness by contrition,\nconfession, and satisfaction; but what kind of purgation this is, we\nhave already stated in a place more suitable to the discussion of it. As\nfar as relates to the present subject, I observe that these consolations\nare too poor and unsubstantial for consciences disturbed, distressed,\ndejected, and overwhelmed with a sense of their sins. For if the Lord,\nby his express interdiction, admits none to a participation of the\nsupper, but those who are righteous and innocent, it requires no little\ncare in any individual to attain an assurance of his possession of that\nrighteousness, which he finds to be required by God. Now, what ground of\nassurance have we, that God is satisfied with persons who have done what\nthey could? And even if this were the case, when shall any man be found\nwho can venture to declare that he has done all that he could? Thus,\nwhile no certain assurance of our worthiness can be obtained, the\nentrance to the sacrament will always remain closed by that dreadful\ninterdiction, which denounces that “he that eateth and drinketh\nunworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself.”\nXLII. Now, it is easy to judge what kind of doctrine this is which\nprevails in the Papacy, and from what author it has proceeded; which by\nits extreme austerity deprives and robs miserable sinners, who are\nalready afflicted with trepidation and sorrow, of the consolation of\nthis sacrament, in which all the comforts of the gospel were set before\nthem. It was certainly impossible for the devil to take a more\ncompendious method of ruining men, than by infatuating them in such a\nmanner as to deprive them of all taste and relish for such food which\ntheir heavenly and most merciful Father had intended for their\nnourishment. That we may not precipitate ourselves into this abyss,\ntherefore, let us remember that this sacred banquet is medicine to the\nsick, comfort to the sinner, alms to the poor; but that it would confer\nno advantage on the healthy, the righteous, and the rich, if any such\ncould be found. For as Christ is given to us in it for food, we\nunderstand, that without him we pine, starve, and faint, as the body\nloses its vigour from want of sustenance. Moreover, as he is given to us\nfor life, we understand that without him we are utterly dead in\nourselves. Wherefore the best and only worthiness that we can present to\nGod, is to offer him our vileness and unworthiness, that he may make us\nworthy of his mercy; to despair in ourselves, that we may find\nconsolation in him; to humble ourselves, that we may be exalted by him;\nto accuse ourselves, that we may be justified by him; likewise to aspire\nto that unity which he enjoins upon us in his supper; and as he makes us\nall to be one in himself, so it should be our desire that we may all\nhave one mind, one heart, and one tongue. If we have these things well\nconsidered and digested in our minds, though we may be disturbed, we\nshall never be subverted by such reflections as this: Needy and\ndestitute of every good, defiled with the pollution of sin, and half\ndead, how could we worthily eat the Lord’s body? We shall rather\nconsider, that we come as paupers to the liberal Benefactor, as patients\nto the Physician, as sinners to the Author of righteousness, as persons\ndead to the fountain of life; that the worthiness which is required by\nGod consists principally in faith, which attributes every thing to\nChrist, and places no dependence on ourselves, and, secondly, in\ncharity, even that charity which it is enough for us to present to God\nin an imperfect state, that he may increase and improve it; for we\ncannot produce it in a state of perfection. Others, who have agreed with\nus that the worthiness which is enjoined consists in faith and charity,\nhave nevertheless fallen into a considerable error respecting the degree\nof that worthiness, requiring a perfection of faith to which nothing can\never approach, and a charity equal to that which Christ has manifested\ntoward us. But by this requisition they exclude all men from access to\nthis sacred supper, as much as the persons to whom we adverted before.\nFor if their opinion were admitted, no person could receive it, but\nunworthily; since all, without a single exception, would be convinced of\ntheir imperfection. And surely it must betray extreme ignorance, not to\nsay stupidity, to require in the reception of the sacrament, that\nperfection which would render the sacrament unnecessary and useless; for\nit was not instituted for the perfect, but for the imperfect and feeble,\nto awaken, excite, stimulate, and exercise their graces of faith and\ncharity, and to correct the defects of both.\nXLIII. With respect to the external ceremonial, whether believers take\nthe bread in their hands or not; whether they divide it between them, or\nevery individual eat that which is given to him; whether they return the\ncup into the hand of the deacon, or deliver it to the person who is\nnext; whether the bread be leavened or unleavened; whether the wine be\nred or white; is not of the least importance. These things are\nindifferent, and left to the liberty of the Church. It is certain,\nhowever, that the custom of the ancient Church was, that every one\nshould take the bread into his hand. And Christ said “Divide it among\nyourselves.”[1323] History informs us, that leavened and common bread\nwas used before the time of Alexander, bishop of Rome, who was the first\nadvocate for unleavened bread; but for what reason I know not, unless it\nwas to dazzle the eyes of the people with admiration of a new spectacle,\nrather than to instruct their minds in pure religion. I appeal to all\nwho feel the least concern for piety, whether they do not clearly\nperceive, how much more conspicuously the glory of God appears in this\nuse of the sacrament, and how much greater abundance of spiritual\nconsolation and delight believers enjoy in it, than in those\ninsignificant and theatrical fooleries which only tend to deceive the\nminds of the gazing multitude. This they call keeping the people in\nreligion, when they lead them into any thing they please, under the\nstupefaction and infatuation of superstition. If any one be inclined to\ndefend such inventions by the plea of antiquity, I am equally aware how\nearly chrism and exorcism were used in baptism, and how soon after the\nage of the apostles, corruptions were introduced into the Lord’s supper;\nbut this is the confidence of human presumption, which can never\nrestrain itself from trifling with the mysteries of God. But let us\nremember, that God holds the obedience of his word in such high\nestimation, that it is the standard by which he appoints us to judge\neven his angels and the whole world. Now, leaving all this mass of\nceremonies, let us remark, that the Lord’s supper might be most properly\nadministered, if it were set before the Church very frequently, and at\nleast once in every week in the following manner: The service should\ncommence with public prayer; in the next place, a sermon should be\ndelivered; then, the bread and wine being placed upon the table, the\nminister should recite the institution of the supper, should declare the\npromises which are left to us in it, and, at the same time, should\nexcommunicate all those who are excluded from it by the prohibition of\nthe Lord; after this, prayer should be offered, that with the same\nbenignity with which our Lord has given us this sacred food, he would\nalso teach and enable us to receive it in faith and gratitude of heart,\nand that, as of ourselves we are not worthy, he would, in his mercy,\nmake us worthy of such a feast. Then either some psalms should be sung,\nor a portion of Scripture should be read, and believers, in a becoming\norder, should participate of the sacred banquet, the ministers breaking\nthe bread and distributing it, and presenting the cup, to the people;\nafter the conclusion of the supper, an exhortation should be given to\nsincere faith, and a confession of the same; to charity, and a\ndeportment worthy of Christians. Finally, thanksgivings should be\nrendered, and praises sung, to God; and to close the whole, the Church\nshould be dismissed in peace.\nXLIV. The observations which we have already made respecting the\nsacrament, abundantly show that it was not instituted for the purpose of\nbeing received once in a year, and that in a careless and formal manner,\nas is now the general practice; but in order to be frequently celebrated\nby all Christians, that they might often call to mind the sufferings of\nChrist; the recollection of which would sustain and strengthen their\nfaith, would incite them to sing praises to God, and to confess and\ncelebrate his goodness, and would also cherish in their hearts, and\npromote the mutual exercise of that charity, the bond of which they\nwould see in the unity of the body of Christ. For whenever we\ncommunicate in the symbol of the Lord’s body, it is like the interchange\nof a mutual pledge, by which we reciprocally bind ourselves to all the\nduties of charity, that no one among us will do any thing by which he\nmay injure his brother, or will omit any thing by which he can assist\nhim, when necessity requires and opportunity admits. That such was the\npractice of the apostolic Church, is mentioned by Luke, when he says\nthat believers “continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and\nfellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.”[1324] The\ninvariable custom, therefore, was, that no assembly of the Church should\nbe held without the word being preached, prayers being offered, the\nLord’s supper administered, and alms given. That this was the order\nestablished among the Corinthians, may be fairly concluded from the\nEpistles of Paul; and it is well known to have been followed for many\nages after. For hence those ancient canons, which are attributed to\nAnacletus and Calixtus, “that, after the consecration is finished, all\nshall communicate, on pain of expulsion from the Church.” And the\nancient canons which are ascribed to the apostles, say, “that those who\ncontinue not to the end, and receive not the sacrament, ought to be\ncorrected as disturbers of the Church.” In the Council of Antioch, also,\nit was decreed, that those who enter into the Church, hear the sermon,\nand retire from the communion, be excluded from the Church till they\nshall have corrected this fault. And though in the first Council of\nToledo, this decree was either mitigated, or at least enacted in a\nmilder form, yet there also it was ordained, that those who shall be\nfound never to communicate after having heard the sermon, be admonished;\nand that, if they obey not the first admonition, they be excommunicated.\nXLV. These decrees were evidently passed by the holy fathers with a view\nto retain and perpetuate the frequent celebration of the communion,\nwhich had been transmitted by the apostles themselves, and which they\nperceived to be highly beneficial to believers, but by negligence to be\ngradually falling into general disuse. Augustine testifies respecting\nthe age in which he lived, when he says, “The sacrament of this thing,\nthat is, of the unity of the body of our Lord, is prepared on the table\nof the Lord, in some places daily, in other places on appointed days, at\nstated intervals of time; and is thence received by some to life, by\nothers to destruction.” And in his first epistle to Januarius: “Some\nreceive the body and blood of the Lord every day, and others receive\nthem on certain days; in some Churches, not a day passes without the\nadministration of the sacrament; in others, it is administered only on\nSaturday and Sunday; and in others only on Sunday.” But the people in\ngeneral, being, as we have observed, sometimes too remiss, the holy\nfathers stimulated them with severe reproofs, that they might not appear\nto connive at such negligence. Of this we have an example in a homily of\nChrysostom, on the Epistle to the Ephesians: “To him who dishonoured the\nfeast, it is not said, Wherefore didst thou sit down? but, How camest\nthou in hither?[1325] Whoever is present here, and is not a partaker of\nthe mysteries, is wicked and impudent. I appeal to you, if any one be\ninvited to a feast, and come, wash his hands, sit down, and apparently\nmake every preparation for partaking of it, and after all taste\nnothing,—will he not offer an insult both to the feast and to him who\nhas provided it? So you, who appear among them who, by prayer prepare\nthemselves to receive the sacred food, who by the very circumstance of\nnot departing, confess yourself to be one of their number, and after all\ndo not participate with them, would it not have been better for you not\nto have made your appearance among them? You will tell me you are\nunworthy. Neither then were you worthy of the communion of prayer, which\nis a preparation for the reception of the holy mystery.”\nXLVI. Augustine and Ambrose unite in condemning the practice which in\ntheir time had already been adopted in the Eastern Churches, for the\npeople to attend as spectators of the celebration of the sacrament, and\nnot to partake of it. And that custom, which enjoins believers to\ncommunicate only once a year, is unquestionably an invention of the\ndevil, whoever were the persons by whom it was introduced. It is said\nthat Zepherinus, bishop of Rome, was the author of that decree; which\nthere is not the least reason for believing to have been such as is now\nrepresented. It is probable that the regulation which he made was not\nill calculated for the interest of the Church under the circumstances of\nthose times. For there is no doubt that the sacred supper was then set\nbefore the faithful whenever they assembled for worship; nor is there\nany more doubt that the principal part of them used to communicate; but\nas it would scarcely ever happen that all could communicate together,\nand it was necessary that those who were mixed with unbelievers and\nidolaters, should testify their faith by some external sign,—that holy\nman, for the sake of order and discipline, appointed that day for all\nthe Christians at Rome to make a public confession of their faith by a\nparticipation of the Lord’s supper. The regulation of Zepherinus was\ngood in itself, but was grossly perverted by his successors, when they\nmade a certain law that there should be one communion in a year; the\nconsequence of which has been, that almost all men, when they have\ncommunicated once, resign themselves to lethargic repose, as if they had\nfairly excused themselves for all the rest of the year. A very different\npractice ought to have been pursued. At least once in every week the\ntable of the Lord ought to have been spread before each congregation of\nChristians, and the promises to have been declared for their spiritual\nnourishment; no person ought to have been compelled to partake, but all\nought to have been exhorted and stimulated, and those who were\nnegligent, to have been reproved. Then all, like persons famished, would\nhave assembled in crowds to such a banquet. I have sufficient reason for\ncomplaining that it was the artifice of the devil that introduced this\ncustom, which, by prescribing one day in a year, renders men slothful\nand careless all the rest of the time. We see that this abuse had\nalready begun to prevail in the time of Chrysostom, but we see at the\nsame time how greatly it displeased him. For in the place which I have\njust quoted, he severely complains of a great inequality in this matter,\nthat oftentimes people would not come to the sacrament all the rest of\nthe year, notwithstanding they were prepared, but that they would come\nat Easter even without preparation. Then he exclaims, “O custom! O\npresumption! In vain, then, is the daily oblation; in vain do we stand\nat the altar. There is no one to partake with us.” So far is such a\npractice from being sanctioned by the authority of Chrysostom.\nXLVII. From the same source proceeded another regulation, which has\nrobbed or deprived the principal part of the people of God of one half\nof the sacred supper; I mean the symbol of the blood, which has been\ninterdicted to the laity and the profane,—for by these titles they\ndistinguish the Lord’s heritage,—and has become the peculiar privilege\nof the few who have received ecclesiastical unction and tonsure. The\nordinance of the eternal God is, “Drink ye all of it;” which man has\nrepealed and abrogated by a new and contrary law, ordaining that all\nshall not drink of it. And these legislators, that they may not appear\nto resist their God without reason, plead the dangers which might result\nif this sacred cup were indiscriminately presented to all; as though\nthose dangers had not been foreseen and considered by the eternal wisdom\nof God. In the next place, they argue with great subtlety, that one is\nsufficient for both. For, if it be the body, they say, it is the whole\nof Christ, who cannot now be separated from his body. The body,\ntherefore, contains the blood. See how human reason is at variance with\nGod, when it has once been left to its own vagaries. Exhibiting the\nbread, our Lord says, “This is my body;” exhibiting the cup, he says,\n“This is my blood.” The audacity of human reason contradicts this, and\naffirms that the bread is the blood, and that the wine is the body; as\nif the Lord had distinguished his body from his blood, both by words and\nby signs, without any cause, and as if it had ever been heard that the\nbody or blood of Christ was called God and man. Certainly, if he had\nintended to designate his whole person, he might have said, “It is I,”\nas the Scripture tells us he did on other occasions; and not, “This is\nmy body; this is my blood.” But, with a view to aid the weakness of our\nfaith, he exhibits the bread and the cup separately, to teach us that he\nis sufficient for drink as well as for food. Now, let one of these parts\nbe taken away, and we shall find only half of our nourishment in him.\nThough it were true, then, as they pretend, that the blood is in the\nbread, and the body in the cup, yet they defraud the souls of believers\nof that confirmation which Christ has delivered as necessary for them.\nTherefore, leaving their subtleties, let us hold fast the benefit which\narises from the double pledge which Christ has ordained.\nXLVIII. I am aware of the cavils advanced on this subject by the\nministers of Satan, who are accustomed to treat the Scripture with\ncontempt. In the first place, they plead, that a simple act affords no\nsufficient ground from which to deduce a rule of perpetual obligation on\nthe observance of the Church. But it is false to call it a simple act;\nfor Christ not only gave the cup to his apostles, but also commanded\nthem to do the same in time to come. For it is the language of command,\n“Drink ye all of it.” And Paul mentions its having been practised in\nsuch a way as fully implies its being a positive ordinance. The second\nsubterfuge is, that Christ admitted none but the apostles to a\nparticipation of this supper, whom he had already chosen and admitted\ninto the order of sacrificing priests. But I would wish them to give me\nanswers to five questions, from which they will not be able to escape,\nbut their misrepresentations will be easily refuted. First; By what\noracle have they obtained this solution, so inconsistent with the word\nof God? The Scripture mentions twelve who sat down with Jesus; but it\ndoes not obscure the dignity of Christ so as to call them sacrificing\npriests—a name which I shall notice in the proper place. Though he then\ngave the sacrament to the twelve, yet he commanded that they should do\nthe same; that is, that they should distribute it among them in a\nsimilar manner. Secondly; why, in that purer period, for almost a\nthousand years after the apostles, were all, without exception, admitted\nto the participation of both symbols? Was the ancient Church ignorant\nwhat guests Christ had admitted to his supper? Any hesitation or evasion\nwould betray the most consummate impudence. Ecclesiastical histories and\nworks of the fathers are still extant, which furnish clear testimonies\nof this fact. Tertullian says, “The flesh is fed with the body and blood\nof Christ, that the soul may be nourished by God.” Ambrose said to\nTheodosius, “With such hands how will you receive the sacred body of the\nLord? With what audacity will you drink his sacred blood?” Jerome says,\n“The priests consecrate the eucharist and distribute the Lord’s blood to\nthe people.” Chrysostom says, “It is not as it was under the ancient\nlaw, when the priest ate one part, and the people another; but to all is\npresented one body and one cup. Every thing in the eucharist is common\nto the priest and to the people.” And the same is attested in various\nplaces by Augustine.\nXLIX. But why do I dispute about a thing that is so evident? Let any one\nread all the Greek and Latin fathers, and he will find them abound with\nsuch testimonies. Nor did this custom fall into disuse while a particle\nof purity remained in the Church. Gregory, who may be justly called the\nlast bishop of Rome, shows that it was observed in his time. He says,\n“You have now learned what the blood of the Lamb is, not by hearing, but\nby drinking. His blood is drunk by the faithful.” And it even continued\nfor four hundred years after his death, notwithstanding the universal\ndegeneracy which had taken place. Nor was it considered merely as a\ncustom, but as an inviolable law. For the Divine institution was then\nreverenced, and no doubt was entertained of the criminality of\nseparating things which the Lord had united. For Gelasius, bishop of\nRome, speaks in the following manner: “We have understood that some,\nonly receiving the Lord’s body, abstain from the cup; who, as they\nappear to be enslaved by an unaccountable superstition, should, without\ndoubt, either receive the sacrament entire, or entirely abstain from it.\nFor no division of this mystery can be made without great sacrilege.”\nAttention was paid to those reasons of Cyprian, which surely ought to be\nsufficient to influence a Christian mind. He says, “How do we teach or\nstimulate them to shed their blood in the confession of Christ, if we\nrefuse his blood to them who are about to engage in the conflict? Or how\ndo we prepare them for the cup of martyrdom, if we do not first admit\nthem, by the right of communion, to drink the cup of the Lord in the\nChurch?” The canonists restrict the decree of Gelasius to the priests,\nbut this is too puerile a cavil to need any refutation.\nL. Thirdly; Why did Christ, when he presented the bread, simply say,\n“Take, eat;” but when he presented the cup, “Drink ye _all_ of it;” as\nif he expressly intended to guard against the subtlety of Satan?\nFourthly; If, as our adversaries pretend, our Lord admitted to his\nsupper none but sacrificing priests, what man can be found so\npresumptuous as to invite to a participation of it strangers whom the\nLord has excluded? and to a participation of that gift, over which they\ncould have no power, without any command from him who alone could give\nit? And with what confidence do they now take upon them to distribute to\nthe people the symbol of the body of Christ, if they have neither the\ncommand nor example of the Lord? Fifthly; Did Paul affirm what was\nfalse, when he said to the Corinthians, “I have received of the Lord\nthat which also I delivered to you?”[1326] For he afterwards declares\nwhat he had delivered, which was, that all, without any distinction,\nshould communicate in both symbols. If Paul had “received of the Lord,”\nthat all were to be admitted without any distinction, let them consider\nfrom whom they have received, who exclude almost all the people of God;\nfor they cannot now pretend their doctrine to have originated from God,\nwith whom is “not yea and nay.”[1327] And yet they dare to shelter such\nabominations under the name of the Church, and to defend them under that\npretext; as if the Church could consist of those antichrists, who so\neasily trample under foot, mutilate, and abolish the doctrine and\ninstitutions of Christ; or as if the apostolic Church, in which true\nreligion displayed all its influence, were not the true Church.\nFootnote 1238:\nMatt. xxvi. 26, 28.

          "title": "CHAPTER XVIII.",
          "content": "THE PAPAL MASS NOT ONLY A SACRILEGIOUS PROFANATION OF THE LORD’S SUPPER,\nBUT A TOTAL ANNIHILATION OF IT.\nWith these, and similar inventions, Satan has endeavoured to obscure,\ncorrupt, and adulterate the sacred supper of Christ, that, at least, its\npurity might not be preserved in the Church. But the perfection of the\ndreadful abomination was his establishment of a sign, by which it might\nbe not only obscured and perverted, but altogether obliterated and\nabolished, so as to disappear from the view, and to depart from the\nremembrance of men. I refer to that most pestilent error with which he\nhas blinded almost the whole world, persuading it to believe that the\nmass is a sacrifice and oblation to procure the remission of sins. How\nthis dogma was at first understood by the sounder schoolmen, who did not\nfall into all the absurdities of their successors, I shall not stay to\ninquire, but shall take leave of them and their thorny subtleties;\nwhich, however they may be defended by subterfuges and cavils, ought to\nbe rejected by all good men, because they merely serve to obscure the\nlustre of the sacred supper. Leaving them, therefore, I wish the readers\nto understand that I am now combating that opinion with which the Roman\nantichrist and his agents have infected the whole world; namely, that\nthe mass is an act by which the priest who offers Christ, and others who\nparticipate in the oblation, merit the favour of God; or that it is an\nexpiatory victim by which they reconcile God to them. Nor has this been\nmerely an opinion generally received by the multitude; but the act\nitself is so ordered, as to be a kind of expiation, to make satisfaction\nto God for the sins of the living and the dead. This is fully expressed\nalso in the words which they use; nor can any thing else be concluded\nfrom its daily observance. I know how deeply this pest has stricken its\nroots, what a plausible appearance of goodness it assumes, how it\nshelters itself under the name of Christ, and how multitudes believe the\nwhole substance of faith to be comprehended under the single word\n_mass_. But when it shall have been most clearly demonstrated by the\nword of God, that this mass, however it may be varnished and adorned,\noffers the greatest insult to Christ, suppresses and conceals his cross,\nconsigns his death to oblivion, deprives us of the benefit resulting\nfrom it, and invalidates and destroys the sacrament which was left as a\nmemorial of that death,—will there be any roots too deep for this most\npowerful axe—I mean the word of God—to cut in pieces and eradicate? Will\nthere be any varnish too specious for this light to detect the evil\nwhich lurks behind it?\nII. Let us proceed, therefore, to establish what we have asserted; in\nthe first place, that the mass offers an intolerable blasphemy and\ninsult to Christ. For he was constituted by his Father a priest and a\nhigh-priest, not for a limited time, like those who are recorded to have\nbeen consecrated priests under the Old Testament, who, having a mortal\nlife, could not have an immortal priesthood; wherefore, there was need\nof successors, from time to time, to fill the places of those who died;\nbut Christ, who is immortal, requires no vicar to be substituted in his\nplace. Therefore he was designated by the Father as “a priest for ever,\nafter the order of Melchisedec;” that he might for ever execute a\npermanent priesthood. This mystery had long before been prefigured in\nMelchisedec, whom the Scripture has introduced once as “the priest of\nthe Most High God,” but never mentions him afterwards, as if there had\nbeen no end to his life. From this resemblance Christ is called a priest\nafter his order.[1328] Now, those who sacrifice every day must\nnecessarily appoint priests to conduct the oblations, and those priests\nmust be substituted in the room of Christ, as his successors and vicars.\nBy this substitution they not only despoil Christ of his due honour, and\nrob him of the prerogative of an eternal priesthood, but endeavour to\ndegrade him from the right hand of the Father, where he cannot sit in\nthe enjoyment of immortality, unless he also remain an eternal priest.\nNor let them plead that their sacrificing priests are not substituted in\nthe place of Christ, as though he were dead, but are merely assistants\nin his eternal priesthood, which does not, on this account, cease to\nremain; for the language of the apostle is too precise for them to avail\nthemselves of such an evasion; when he says that “they truly were many\npriests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of\ndeath.”[1329] Christ, therefore, whose continuance is not prevented by\ndeath, is only one, and needs no companions. Yet they have the\neffrontery to arm themselves with the example of Melchisedec in defence\nof their impiety. For, because he is said to have “brought forth bread\nand wine,” they conclude this to have been a prefiguration of their\nmass, as though the resemblance between him and Christ consisted in the\noblation of bread and wine; which is too unsubstantial and frivolous to\nneed any refutation. Melchisedec gave bread and wine to Abraham and his\ncompanions, to refresh them when they were fatigued on their return from\nbattle. What has this to do with a sacrifice? Moses praises the humanity\nand liberality of the pious king; these men presumptuously fabricate a\nmystery, of which the Scripture makes no mention. Yet they varnish their\nerror with another pretext, because the historian immediately afterwards\nsays, “And he was the priest of the Most High God.” I answer, that they\nmisapply to the bread and wine what the apostle refers to the\nbenediction, “For this Melchisedec, priest of the Most High God, met\nAbraham and blessed him;” from which the same apostle, than whom it is\nunnecessary to seek for a better expositor, argues his superior dignity;\n“for without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the\nbetter.”[1330] But, if the offering of Melchisedec had been a figure of\nthe sacrifice of the mass, is it credible that the apostle, who\ndiscusses all the minutest circumstances, would have forgotten a thing\nof such high importance? It will be in vain for them, with all their\nsophistry, to attempt to overturn the argument which the apostle himself\nadduces, that the right and dignity of priesthood ceases among mortal\nmen, because Christ, who is immortal, is the alone and perpetual priest.\nIII. A second property of the mass we have stated to be, that it\nsuppresses and conceals the cross and passion of Christ. It is beyond\nall contradiction, that the cross of Christ is subverted as soon as ever\nan altar is erected; for if Christ offered up himself a sacrifice on the\ncross, to sanctify us for ever, and to obtain eternal redemption for us,\nthe virtue and efficacy of that sacrifice must certainly continue\nwithout any end.[1331] Otherwise, we should have no more honourable\nideas of Christ, than of the animal victims which were sacrificed under\nthe law, the oblations of which are proved to have been weak and\ninefficacious, by the circumstance of their frequent repetition.\nWherefore, it must be acknowledged, either that the sacrifice which\nChrist accomplished on the cross wanted the virtue of eternal\npurification, or that Christ has offered up one perfect sacrifice, once\nfor all ages. This is what the apostle says that this great high-priest,\neven Christ, “now once in the end of the world, hath appeared to put\naway sin by the sacrifice of himself.” Again: “By the will of God we are\nsanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for\nall.” Again: “That by one offering Christ hath perfected for ever them\nthat are sanctified.” To which he subjoins this remarkable observation:\n“That where remission of iniquities is, there is no more offering for\nsin.”[1332] This was likewise signified by the last words of Christ,\nwhen, with his expiring breath he said, “It is finished.”[1333] We are\naccustomed to consider the last words of dying persons as oracular.\nChrist, at the moment of his death, declared that by his own sacrifice\nevery thing necessary to our salvation had been accomplished and\nfinished. To such a sacrifice, the perfection of which he so explicitly\ndeclares, shall it be lawful for us to make innumerable additions every\nday, as though it were imperfect? While God’s most holy word not only\naffirms, but proclaims and protests, that this sacrifice was once\nperfect, and that its virtue is eternal,—do not they who require another\nsacrifice charge this with imperfection and inefficacy? But what is the\ntendency of the mass, which admits of a hundred thousand sacrifices\nbeing offered every day, except it be to obscure and suppress the\npassion of Christ, by which he offered himself as the alone sacrifice to\nthe Father? Who, that is not blind, does not see that such an opposition\nto the clear and manifest truth must have arisen from the audacity of\nSatan? I am aware of the fallacies with which that father of falsehood\nis accustomed to varnish over this fraud; as, that these are not various\nor different sacrifices, but only a repetition of that one sacrifice.\nBut such illusions are easily dissipated. For, through the whole\nargument, the apostle is contending, not only that there are no other\nsacrifices, but that that one sacrifice was offered once, and is never\nto be repeated. The more artful sophisters have recourse to a deeper\nsubterfuge; that the mass is not a repetition of that sacrifice, but an\napplication of it. This sophistry also may be confuted, without any more\ndifficulty than the former. For Christ once offered up himself, not that\nhis sacrifice might be daily ratified by new oblations, but that the\nbenefit of it might be communicated to us by the preaching of the\ngospel, and the administration of the sacred supper. Thus Paul says that\n“Christ our passover is sacrificed for us,” and commands us to feast on\nhim.[1334] This, I say, is the way in which the sacrifice of the cross\nof our Lord Jesus Christ is rightly applied to us, when it is\ncommunicated to us for our enjoyment, and we receive it with true faith.\nIV. But it is worth while to hear on what other foundation they rest the\nsacrifice of the mass. They apply to this purpose the prophecy of\nMalachi, in which the Lord promises, that “from the rising of the sun\neven unto the going down of the same, incense shall be offered unto” his\n“name, and a pure offering.”[1335] As though it were a new or unusual\nthing for the prophets, when they speak of the calling of the Gentiles,\nto designate the spiritual worship of God, to which they exhort them, by\nthe external ceremonies of the law; in order to show, in a more familiar\nmanner, to the men of their own times, that the Gentiles were to be\nintroduced to a participation of the true religion; as it is their\ninvariable practice, on all occasions, to describe the realities which\nhave been exhibited in the gospel, under the types and figures of the\ndispensation under which they lived. Thus, conversion to the Lord they\nexpress by going up to Jerusalem; adoration of God, by oblations of\nvarious gifts; the more extensive knowledge to be bestowed on believers,\nin the kingdom of Christ, by dreams and visions.[1336] The prophecy\nwhich they adduce, therefore, is similar to another prediction of\nIsaiah, where he foretells the erection of three altars, in Assyria,\nEgypt, and Judea.[1337] I ask the Romanists, first, whether they do not\nadmit this prediction to have been accomplished in the kingdom of\nChrist; secondly, where are these altars, or when were they ever\nerected; thirdly, whether they think that those two kingdoms were\ndestined to have their respective temples, like that at Jerusalem. A due\nconsideration of these things, I think, will induce them to acknowledge,\nthat the prophet, under types adapted to his own time, was predicting\nthe spiritual worship of God, which was to be propagated all over the\nworld. This is our solution of the passage which they adduce from\nMalachi; but as examples of this mode of expression are of such frequent\noccurrence, I shall not employ myself in a further enumeration of them.\nHere, also, they are miserably deceived, in acknowledging no sacrifice\nbut that of the mass; whereas, believers do in reality now sacrifice to\nthe Lord, and offer a pure oblation, of which we shall presently treat.\nV. I now proceed to the third view of the mass, under which I am to show\nhow it obliterates and expunges from the memory of mankind the true and\nalone death of Jesus Christ. For as among men the confirmation of a\ntestament depends on the death of the testator, so also our Lord, by his\ndeath, has confirmed the testament in which he has given us remission of\nsins, and everlasting righteousness. Those who dare to attempt any\nvariation or innovation in this testament, thereby deny his death, and\nrepresent it as of no value. Now, what is the mass, but a new and\ntotally different testament? For does not every separate mass promise a\nnew remission of sins, and a new acquisition of righteousness; so that\nthere are now as many testaments as masses? Let Christ, therefore, come\nagain, and by another death ratify this new testament, or rather, by\ninnumerable deaths, confirm these innumerable testaments of masses. Have\nI not truly said, then, at the beginning, that the true and alone death\nof Christ is obliterated and consigned to oblivion by the masses? And is\nnot the direct tendency of the mass, to cause Christ, if it were\npossible, to be put to death again? “For where a testament is,” says the\napostle, “there must also, of necessity, be the death of the\ntestator.”[1338] The mass pretends to exhibit a new testament of Christ;\ntherefore it requires his death. Moreover the victim which is offered\nmust, of necessity, be slain and immolated. If Christ be sacrificed in\nevery mass, he must be cruelly murdered in a thousand separate places at\nonce. This is not _my_ argument; it is the reasoning of the apostle: “It\nwas not necessary that he should offer himself often; for then must he\noften have suffered since the foundation of the world.”[1339] In reply\nto this, I confess, they are ready to charge us with calumny; alleging\nthat we impute to them sentiments which they never have held, nor ever\ncan hold. We know, indeed, that the life and death of Christ are not in\ntheir power; and whether they intend to murder him, we do not inquire;\nwe only mean to show the absurdities which follow from their impious and\nabominable doctrine, and this we have proved from the mouth of the\napostle. They may reply a hundred times, if they please, that this\nsacrifice is without blood; but I shall deny that sacrifices can change\ntheir nature, at the caprice of men; for thus the sacred and inviolable\ninstitution of God would fall to the ground. Hence it follows, that this\nprinciple of the apostle can never be shaken, that “without shedding of\nblood is no remission.”[1340]\nVI. We are now to treat of the fourth property of the mass, which is, to\nprevent us from perceiving and reflecting on the death of Christ, and\nthereby to deprive us of the benefit resulting from it. For who can\nconsider himself as redeemed by the death of Christ, when he sees a new\nredemption in the mass? Who can be assured that his sins are remitted,\nwhen he sees another remission? It is not a sufficient answer, to say,\nthat we obtain remission of sins in the mass, only because it has been\nalready procured by the death of Christ. For this is no other than\npretending that Christ has redeemed us in order that we may redeem\nourselves. For this is the doctrine which has been disseminated by the\nministers of Satan, and which they now defend by clamours, and fire, and\nsword; that when we offer up Christ to his Father, in the sacrifice of\nthe mass, we, by that act of oblation, obtain remission of sins, and\nbecome partakers of the passion of Christ. What remains, then, to the\npassion of Christ, but to be an example of redemption, by which we may\nlearn to be our own redeemers? Christ himself, when he seals the\nassurance of pardon in the sacred supper, does not command his disciples\nto rest in this act, but refers them to the sacrifice of his death;\nsignifying that the supper is a monument, or memorial, appointed to\nteach us that the expiatory victim by which God was to be appeased ought\nto be offered but once. Nor is it sufficient to know that Christ is the\nsole victim, unless we also know that there is only one oblation, so\nthat our faith may be fixed upon his cross.\nVII. I come now to the concluding observation; that the sacred supper,\nin which our Lord had left us the memorial of his passion impressed and\nengraven, has, by the erection of the mass, been removed, abolished, and\ndestroyed. For the supper itself is a gift of God, which ought to be\nreceived with thanksgiving. The sacrifice of the mass is pretended to be\na price given to God, and received by him as a satisfaction. As far as\n_giving_ differs from _receiving_, so far does the sacrifice of the mass\ndiffer from the sacrament of the supper. And this is the most miserable\ningratitude of man, that where the profusion of the Divine goodness\nought to have been acknowledged with thanksgivings, there he makes God\nhis debtor. The sacrament promised, that by the death of Christ we are\nnot only restored to life, but are perpetually vivified, because every\npart of our salvation was then accomplished. The sacrifice of the mass\nproclaims a very different doctrine; that it is necessary for Christ to\nbe sacrificed every day, in order to be of any advantage to us. The\nsupper ought to be distributed in the public congregation of the Church,\nto instruct us in the communion by which we are all connected together\nin Christ Jesus. The sacrifice of the mass dissolves and destroys this\ncommunion. For the reception of this error rendered it necessary that\nthere should be priests to sacrifice for the people; and the supper, as\nif it had been resigned to them, ceased to be administered to the Church\nof believers, according to the commandment of the Lord. A way was opened\nfor the admission of private masses, which represented a kind of\nexcommunication, rather than that communion which had been instituted by\nour Lord, when the mass-priest separates himself from the whole\ncongregation of believers, to devour his sacrifice alone. That no person\nmay be deceived, I call it a private mass, wherever there is no\nparticipation of the Lord’s supper among believers, whatever number of\npersons may be present as spectators of it.\nVIII. With respect to the word _mass_ itself, I have never been able\ncertainly to determine whence it originated; only I think it may\nprobably have been derived from the oblations which used to be made at\nthe sacrament. Hence the ancient fathers generally use it in the plural\nnumber. But to forbear all controversy respecting the term, I say that\nprivate masses are diametrically repugnant to the institution of Christ,\nand are consequently an impious profanation of the sacred supper. For\nwhat has the Lord commanded us? Is it not to take and divide it among\nus?[1341] What observance of the command does Paul inculcate? Is it not\nthe breaking of the bread, which is the communion of the body of\nChrist?[1342] When one man takes it, therefore, without any\ndistribution, what resemblance does this bear to the command? But it is\nalleged, that this one man does it in the name of the whole Church. I\nask, by what authority? Is not this an open mockery of God, when one\nperson does separately, by himself, that which ought not to have been\ndone but among many? The words of Christ, and of Paul, are sufficiently\nclear to authorize the conclusion, that wherever there is no breaking of\nthe bread for common distribution among believers, there is not the\nsupper of the Lord, but a false and preposterous imitation of it. But a\nfalse imitation is a corruption; and the corruption of so great a\nmystery cannot take place without impiety. Private masses, therefore,\nare an impious abuse. And as one abuse in religion soon produces\nanother, after the introduction of this custom of offering without\ncommunicating, they began by degrees to have innumerable masses in all\nthe corners of the temples, and thus to divide the people from each\nother, who ought to have united in one assembly, to celebrate the\nmystery of their union. Now, let the Romanists deny, if they can, that\nthey are guilty of idolatry in exhibiting bread in their masses, to be\nworshipped instead of Christ. In vain do they boast of those promises of\nthe presence of Christ; for however they may be understood, they\ncertainly were not given in order that impure and profane men, whenever\nthey please, and for whatever improper use, may transmute bread into the\nbody of Christ; but in order that believers, religiously observing the\ncommand of Christ, in celebrating the supper, may enjoy a true\nparticipation of him in it.\nIX. In the purer times of the Church, this corruption was unknown. For,\nhowever the more impudent of our adversaries endeavour to misrepresent\nthis matter, yet it is beyond all doubt that all antiquity is against\nthem, as we have already evinced in other points, and may be more fully\ndetermined by a diligent perusal of the ancient fathers. But before I\nconclude this subject, I will ask our advocates for masses, since they\nknow that “the Lord hath” not “as great delight in sacrifices, as in\nobeying the voice of the Lord,” and that “to obey is better than\nsacrifice,”[1343] how they can believe this kind of sacrificing to be\nacceptable to God, for which they have no command, and which they do not\nfind to be sanctioned by a single syllable of the Scripture. Moreover,\nsince they hear the apostle say, that “no man taketh” the name and\n“honour” of the priesthood “unto himself, but he that is called of God,\nas was Aaron,” and that even “Christ glorified not himself to be made a\nhigh-priest,” but obeyed the call of his Father;[1344] either they must\nprove God to be the author and institutor of their priesthood, or they\nmust confess the honour not to be of God, into which they have\npresumptuously and wickedly obtruded themselves, without any call. But\nthey cannot produce a tittle which affords the least support to their\npriesthood. What, then, will become of their sacrifices, since no\nsacrifices can be offered without a priest?\nX. If any one should bring forward mutilated passages, extracted from\ndifferent parts of the writings of the fathers, and contend, on their\nauthority, that the sacrifice which is offered in the supper ought to be\nunderstood in a different manner from the representation we have given\nof it, he shall receive the following brief reply: If the question\nrelate to an approbation of this notion of a sacrifice which the Papists\nhave invented in the mass, the ancient fathers are very far from\ncountenancing such a sacrilege. They do, indeed, use the word\n_sacrifice_, but they at the same time fully declare, that they mean\nnothing more than the commemoration of that true and only sacrifice\nwhich Christ, whom they invariably speak of as our only Priest,\ncompleted on the cross. Augustine says, “The Hebrews, in the animal\nvictims which they offered to God, celebrated the prophecy of the future\nvictim which Christ has since offered; Christians, by the holy oblation\nand participation of the body of Christ, celebrate the remembrance of\nthe sacrifice which is already completed.” Here he evidently inculcates\nthe same sentiment that is expressed more at large in the Treatise, on\nFaith, which has been attributed to him, though it is doubtful who was\nthe author, addressed to Peter the Deacon; in which we find the\nfollowing passage: “Hold this most firmly, and admit not the least\ndoubt, that the only begotten Son of God himself, being made flesh for\nus, hath offered himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a\nsweet-smelling savour; to whom, with the Father and the Holy Spirit,\nanimals were sacrificed in the time of the Old Testament; and to whom\nnow, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, (with whom he has one and the\nsame Divinity,) the holy Church, throughout the world, ceases not to\noffer the sacrifice of bread and wine. For in those carnal victims there\nwas a prefiguration of the flesh of Christ, which he himself was to\noffer for our sins, and of his blood, which he was to shed for the\nremission of our sins. But in the present sacrifice, there is a\nthanksgiving and commemoration of the flesh of Christ, which he has\noffered, and of his blood, which he has shed for us.” Hence Augustine\nhimself, in various passages, explains it to be nothing more than a\nsacrifice of praise. And it is a remark often found in his writings,\nthat the Lord’s supper is called a sacrifice, for no other reason than\nbecause it is a memorial, image, and attestation, of that singular,\ntrue, and only sacrifice, by which Christ has redeemed us. There is also\na remarkable passage in his Treatise on the Trinity, where, after having\ntreated of the only sacrifice, he thus concludes: “In a sacrifice, four\nthings are to be considered—to whom it is offered, by whom it is\noffered, what is offered, and for whom it is offered. The alone and true\nMediator, by a sacrifice of peace, reconciling us to God, remains one\nwith him to whom he has offered it; makes them for whom he has offered\nit one in himself; is the one who alone has offered it; and is himself\nthe oblation which he has offered.” Chrysostom also speaks to the same\npurpose. And they ascribe the honour of the priesthood so exclusively to\nChrist, that Augustine declares, that if any one should set up a bishop\nas an intercessor between God and man, it would be the language of\nAntichrist.\nXI. Yet we do not deny that the oblation of Christ is there exhibited to\nus in such a manner, that the view of his cross is almost placed before\nour eyes; as the apostle says, that by the preaching of the cross to the\nGalatians, “Christ had been evidently set forth before their eyes,\ncrucified among them.”[1345] But as I perceive that those ancient\nfathers misapplied this memorial to a purpose inconsistent with the\ninstitution of the Lord, because the supper, as celebrated by them,\nrepresented I know not what appearance of a reiterated, or at least\nrenewed oblation, the safest way for pious minds will be to acquiesce in\nthe pure and simple ordinance of the Lord, whose supper this sacrament\nis called, because it ought to be regulated by his sole authority.\nFinding them to have retained orthodox and pious sentiments of this\nwhole mystery, and not detecting them of having intended the least\nderogation from the one and alone sacrifice of Christ, I dare not\ncondemn them for impiety; yet I think it impossible to exculpate them\nfrom having committed some error in the external form. For they imitated\nthe Jewish mode of sacrificing, more than Christ had commanded, or the\nnature of the gospel admitted. The censure which they have deserved,\ntherefore, is for this preposterous conformity to the Old Testament;\nthat, not content with the simple and genuine institution of Christ,\nthey have symbolized too much with the shadows of the law.\nXII. If any person will attentively examine, he will observe this\ndistinction clearly marked by the word of the Lord, between the Mosaic\nsacrifices and our eucharist; that though those sacrifices represented\nto the Jewish people the same efficacy of the death of Christ which is\nnow exhibited to us in the Lord’s supper, yet the mode of representation\nwas different. For the Jewish priests were commanded to prefigure the\nsacrifice which was to be accomplished by Christ; a victim was presented\nin the place of Christ himself; there was an altar on which it was to be\nimmolated; in short, every thing was conducted in such a manner as to\nset before the eyes of the people a representation of the sacrifice\nwhich was to be offered to God as an atonement for sins. But since that\nsacrifice has been accomplished, the Lord has prescribed to us a\ndifferent method, in order to communicate to believers the benefit of\nthe sacrifice which has been offered to him by his Son. Therefore he has\ngiven us a table at which we are to feast, not an altar upon which any\nvictim is to be offered: he has not consecrated priests to offer\nsacrifices, but ministers to distribute the sacred banquet. In\nproportion to the superior sublimity and sanctity of the mystery, with\nthe greater care and reverence it ought to be treated. The safest\ncourse, therefore, is to relinquish all the presumption of human reason,\nand to adhere strictly to what the Scripture enjoins. And surely, if we\nconsider that it is the supper of the Lord, and not of men, there is no\ncause why we should suffer ourselves to be moved a hair’s breadth from\nthe scriptural rule by any authority of men or prescription of years.\nTherefore, when the apostle was desirous of purifying it from all the\nfaults which had already crept into the Church at Corinth, he adopted\nthe best and readiest method, by recalling it to the one original\ninstitution, which he shows ought to be regarded as its perpetual rule.\nXIII. That no wrangler may take occasion to oppose us from the terms\n_sacrifice_ and _priest_, I will briefly state what I have meant by\nthese terms all through this argument. Some extend the word _sacrifice_\nto all religions ceremonies and actions; but for this I see no reason.\nWe know that, by the constant usage of the Scripture, the word\n_sacrifice_ is applied to what the Greeks call sometimes θυσια,\nsometimes προσφορα, and sometimes τελετη, which, taken generally,\ncomprehends whatever is offered to God. Wherefore it is necessary for us\nto make a distinction, but such a distinction as may be consistent with\nthe sacrifices of the Mosaic law; under the shadows of which the Lord\ndesigned to represent to his people all the truth of spiritual\nsacrifices. Though there were various kinds of them, yet they may all be\nreferred to two classes. For either they were oblations made for sin in\na way of satisfaction, by which guilt was expiated before God, or they\nwere symbols of Divine worship and attestations of devotion. This second\nclass comprehended three kinds of sacrifices: some were offered in a way\nof supplication, to implore the favour of God; some in a way of\nthanksgiving, to testify the gratitude of the mind for benefits\nreceived; and some as simple expressions of piety, to renew the\nconfirmation of the covenant: to this class belonged burnt-offerings and\ndrink-offerings, first-fruits and peace-offerings. Therefore let _us_\nalso divide sacrifices into two kinds, and for the sake of distinction\ncall one the _sacrifice of worship_ and _piety_, because it consists in\nthe veneration and service of God, which he demands and receives from\nbelievers; or it may be called, if you prefer it, the _sacrifice of\nthanksgiving_; for it is presented to God by none but persons who,\nloaded with his immense benefits, devote themselves and all their\nactions to him in return. The other may be called the _sacrifice of\npropitiation_ or _expiation_. A sacrifice of expiation is that which is\noffered to appease the wrath of God, to satisfy his justice, and thereby\nto purify and cleanse from sins, that the sinner, delivered from the\ndefilement of iniquity, and restored to the purity of righteousness, may\nbe re-admitted to the favour of God. This was the designation, under the\nlaw, of those victims which were offered for the expiation of sins; not\nthat they were sufficient to effect the restoration of the favour of\nGod, or the obliteration of iniquity, but because they prefigured that\ntrue sacrifice which at length was actually accomplished by Christ\nalone; by him alone, because it could be made by no other; and once for\nall, because the virtue and efficacy of that one sacrifice is eternal;\nas Christ himself declared, when he said, “It is finished;”[1346] that\nis to say, whatever was necessary to reconcile us to the Father, and to\nobtain remission of sins, righteousness, and salvation, was all effected\nand completed by that one oblation of himself, which was so perfect as\nto leave no room for any other sacrifice afterwards.\nXIV. Wherefore, I conclude, that it is a most criminal insult, and\nintolerable blasphemy, both against Christ himself, and against the\nsacrifice which he completed on our behalf by his death upon the cross,\nfor any man to repeat any oblation with a view to procure the pardon of\nsins, propitiate God, and obtain righteousness. But what is the object\nof the mass, except it be that by the merit of a new oblation we may be\nmade partakers of the passion of Christ? And that there might be no\nlimits to their folly, they have not been satisfied with affirming it to\nbe a common sacrifice offered equally for the whole Church, without\nadding, that it was in their power to make a peculiar application of it\nto any individual they chose, or rather to every one who was willing to\npurchase such a commodity with ready money. Though they could not reach\nthe price of Judas, yet, to exemplify some characteristic of their\nauthor, they have retained the resemblance of number. Judas sold Jesus\nfor thirty pieces of silver; these men, as far as in them lies, sell\nhim, in French money, for thirty pieces of copper; Judas sold him but\nonce; they sell him as often as they meet with a purchaser. In this\nsense, we deny that they are priests; that they can intercede with God\non behalf of the people by such an oblation; that they can appease the\nwrath of God, or obtain the remission of sins. For Christ is the sole\nPriest and High-Priest of the New Testament, to whom all the ancient\npriesthoods have been transferred, and in whom they are all terminated\nand closed. And even if the Scripture had made no mention of the eternal\npriesthood of Christ, yet as God, since the abrogation of the former\npriesthoods, has instituted no other, the argument of the apostle is\nirrefragable, that “no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that\nis called of God.”[1347] With what effrontery, then, do these\nsacrilegious mortals, who boast of being the executioners of Christ,\ndare to call themselves priests of the living God!\nXV. There is a beautiful passage in Plato, in which he treats of the\nancient expiations among the heathen, and ridicules the foolish\nconfidence of wicked and profligate men, who thought that such disguises\nwould conceal their crimes from the view of their gods, and, as if they\nhad made a compromise with their gods, indulged themselves in their\nvices with the greater security. This passage almost seems as if it had\nbeen written with a view to the missal expiation as it is now practised\nin the world. To defraud and circumvent another person, every one knows\nto be unlawful. To injure widows, to plunder orphans, to harass the\npoor, to obtain the property of others by wicked arts, to seize any\none’s fortune by perjuries and frauds, to oppress a neighbour with\nviolence and tyrannical terror, are universally acknowledged to be\nenormous crimes. How, then, do so many persons dare to commit all these\nsins, as if they might perpetrate them with impunity? If we duly\nconsider, we shall find that they derive fresh encouragement from no\nother cause than the confidence which they feel that they shall be able\nto satisfy God by the sacrifice of the mass, as a complete discharge of\nall their obligations to him, or at least that it affords them an easy\nmode of compromising with him. Plato afterwards goes on to ridicule the\ngross stupidity of those who expect by such expiations to be delivered\nfrom the punishments which they would otherwise have to suffer in hell.\nAnd what is the design of the obits, or anniversary obsequies, and the\ngreater part of the masses, but that those who all their lifetime have\nbeen the most cruel of tyrants, the most rapacious of robbers, or\nabandoned to every enormity, as if redeemed with this price, may escape\nthe fire of purgatory?\nXVI. Under the other kind of sacrifices, which we have called _the\nsacrifice of thanksgiving_, are included all the offices of charity,\nwhich when we perform to our brethren, we honour the Lord himself in his\nmembers; and likewise all our prayers, praises, thanksgivings, and every\nthing that we do in the service of God; all which are dependent on a\ngreater sacrifice, by which we are consecrated in soul and body as holy\ntemples to the Lord. It is not enough for our external actions to be\nemployed in his service: it is necessary that first ourselves, and then\nall our works, be consecrated and dedicated to him; that whatever\nbelongs to us may conduce to his glory, and discover a zeal for its\nadvancement. This kind of sacrifice has no tendency to appease the wrath\nof God, to procure remission of sins, or to obtain righteousness: its\nsole object is to magnify and exalt the glory of God. For it cannot be\nacceptable and pleasing to God, except from the hands of those whom he\nhas already favoured with the remission of their sins, reconciled to\nhimself, and absolved from guilt; and it is so necessary to the Church\nas to be altogether indispensable. Therefore it will continue to be\noffered for ever, as long as the people of God shall exist; as we have\nalready seen from the prophet. For so far are we from wishing to abolish\nit, that in that sense we are pleased to understand the following\nprediction: “From the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the\nsame, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place\nincense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering; for my name\nshall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.”[1348] So\nPaul enjoins us to “present” our “bodies, a living sacrifice, holy,\nacceptable unto God,” which is our “reasonable service.”[1349] He has\nexpressed himself with the strictest propriety, by adding that this is\nour reasonable service; for he intended a spiritual kind of Divine\nworship, which he tacitly opposed to the carnal sacrifices of the Mosaic\nlaw. So “to do good, and to communicate,” are called “sacrifices with\nwhich God is well pleased.”[1350] So the liberality of the Philippians\nin supplying the wants of Paul was “an odour of a sweet smell, a\nsacrifice acceptable and well pleasing to God.”[1351] So all the good\nworks of believers are spiritual sacrifices.\nXVII. Why do I multiply quotations? This form of expression is\nperpetually occurring in the Scriptures. And even while the people were\nkept under the external discipline of the law, it was sufficiently\ndeclared by the prophets that those carnal sacrifices contained a\nreality and truth which is common to the Christian Church, as well as to\nthe nation of the Jews. For this reason David prayed, “Let my prayer be\nset forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the\nevening sacrifice.”[1352] And Hosea called thanksgivings “the calves of\nour lips,”[1353] which David calls “offering thanksgiving” and “offering\npraise.”[1354] In imitation of the Psalmist, the apostle himself says,\n“Let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually;” and by way of\nexplanation adds, “that is, the fruit of our lips,” confessing or giving\n“thanks to his name.”[1355] This kind of sacrifice is indispensable in\nthe supper of the Lord, in which, while we commemorate and declare his\ndeath, and give thanks, we do no other than offer the sacrifice of\npraise. From this sacrificial employment, all Christians are called “a\nroyal priesthood;”[1356] because, as the apostle says, “By Christ we\noffer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips,\ngiving thanks to his name.” For we do not appear in the presence of God\nwith our oblations without an intercessor; Christ is the Mediator, by\nwhom we offer ourselves and all that we have to the Father. He is our\nHigh Priest, who, having entered into the celestial sanctuary, opens the\nway of access for us. He is our altar, upon which we place our\noblations, that whatever we venture to do, we may attempt in him. In a\nword, it is he that “hath made us kings and priests unto God.”[1357]\nXVIII. What remains, then, but for the blind to see, the deaf to hear,\nand even children to understand, this abomination of the mass? which,\nbeing presented in a vessel of gold, has so inebriated and stupefied all\nthe kings and people of the earth, from the highest to the lowest, that,\nmore senseless than the brutes themselves, they have placed the whole of\ntheir salvation in this fatal gulf. Surely Satan never employed a more\npowerful engine to assail and conquer the kingdom of Christ. This is the\nHelen, for which the enemies of the truth in the present day contend\nwith cruelty, rage, and fury; a Helen, indeed, with which they so\npollute themselves with spiritual fornication, which is the most\nexecrable of all. Here I touch not, even with my little finger, the\ngross abuses which they might pretend to be profanations of the purity\nof their holy mass; what a scandalous traffic they carry on, what sordid\ngains they make by their masses, with what enormous rapacity they\ngratify their avarice. I only point out, and that in few and plain\nwords, the true nature of the most sanctimonious sanctity of the mass,\non account of which it has attracted so much admiration and veneration\nfor so many ages. For an illustration of such great mysteries\nproportioned to their dignity, would require a larger treatise; and I am\nunwilling to introduce those disgusting corruptions which are\nuniversally notorious; that all men may understand that the mass,\nconsidered in its choicest and most estimable purity, without any of its\nappendages, from the beginning to the end, is full of every species of\nimpiety, blasphemy, idolatry, and sacrilege.\nXIX. The readers may now see, collected into a brief summary, almost\nevery thing that I have thought important to be known respecting these\ntwo sacraments; the use of which has been enjoined on the Christian\nChurch from the commencement of the New Testament until the end of time;\nthat is to say, baptism, to be a kind of entrance into the Church, and\nan initiatory profession of faith; and the Lord’s supper, to be a\ncontinual nourishment, with which Christ spiritually feeds his family of\nbelievers. Wherefore, as there is but “one God, one Christ, one faith,”\none Church, the body of Christ, so there is only “one baptism” and that\nis never repeated; but the supper is frequently distributed, that those\nwho have once been admitted into the Church, may understand that they\nare continually nourished by Christ. Beside these two, as no other\nsacrament has been instituted by God, so no other ought to be\nacknowledged by the Church of believers. For that it is not left to the\nwill of man to institute new sacraments, will be easily understood if we\nremember what has already been very plainly stated—that sacraments are\nappointed by God for the purpose of instructing us respecting some\npromise of his, and assuring us of his good-will towards us; and if we\nalso consider, that no one has been the counsellor of God, capable of\naffording us any certainty respecting his will,[1358] or furnishing us\nany assurance of his disposition towards us, what he chooses to give or\nto deny us. Hence it follows, that no one can institute a sign to be a\ntestimony respecting any determination or promise of his; he alone can\nfurnish us a testimony respecting himself by giving a sign. I will\nexpress myself in terms more concise, and perhaps more homely, but more\nexplicit—that there can be no sacrament unaccompanied with a promise of\nsalvation. All mankind, collected in one assembly, can promise us\nnothing respecting our salvation. Therefore they can never institute or\nestablish a sacrament.\nXX. Let the Christian Church, therefore, be content with these two, and\nnot only neither admit nor acknowledge any other at present, but neither\ndesire nor expect any other to the end of the world. For as the Jews,\nbeside the ordinary sacraments given to them, had also several others,\ndiffering according to the varying circumstances of different periods,\nsuch as the manna, the water issuing from the rock, the brazen serpent,\nand the like, they were admonished by this variation not to rest in such\nfigures, which were of short duration, but to expect from God something\nbetter, which should undergo no change and come to no end. But our case\nis very different: to us Christ has been revealed, “in whom are hid all\nthe treasures of wisdom and knowledge,”[1359] in such abundance and\nprofusion, that to hope or desire any new accession to these treasures\nwould really be to displease God, and provoke his wrath against us. We\nmust hunger after Christ, we must seek, contemplate, and learn him\nalone, till the dawning of that great day, when our Lord will fully\nmanifest the glory of his kingdom, and reveal himself to us, so that “we\nshall see him as he is.”[1360] And for this reason, the dispensation\nunder which we live is designated in the Scriptures as “the last time,”\n“these last times,” “the last days,”[1361] that no one may deceive\nhimself with a vain expectation of any new doctrine or revelation. For\n“God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto\nthe fathers by the prophets, hath, in these last days, spoken unto us by\nhis Son,”[1362] who alone is able to “reveal the Father,”[1363] and who,\nindeed, “hath declared him”[1364] fully, as far as is necessary for our\nhappiness, while “now we see” him “through a glass darkly.”[1365] As men\nare not left at liberty to institute new sacraments in the Church of\nGod, so it were to be wished that as little as possible of human\ninvention should be mixed with those which have been instituted by God.\nFor as wine is diluted and lost by an infusion of water, and as a whole\nmass of meal contracts acidity from a sprinkling of leaven, so the\npurity of Divine mysteries is only polluted when man makes any addition\nof his own. And yet we see, as the sacraments are observed in the\npresent day, how very far they have degenerated from their original\npurity. There is every where an excess of pageantries, ceremonies, and\ngesticulations; but no consideration or mention of the word of God,\nwithout which even the sacraments themselves cease to be sacraments. And\nthe very ceremonies which have been instituted by God are not to be\ndiscerned among such a multitude of others, by which they are\noverwhelmed. In baptism, how little is seen of that which ought to be\nthe only conspicuous object—I mean baptism itself? And the Lord’s supper\nhas been completely buried since it has been transformed into the mass;\nexcept that it is exhibited once a year, but in a partial and mutilated\nform.\nFootnote 1328:\nGen. xiv. 18.

          "content": "THE FIVE OTHER CEREMONIES, FALSELY CALLED SACRAMENTS, PROVED NOT TO BE\nSACRAMENTS; THEIR NATURE EXPLAINED.\nThe preceding discussion respecting the sacraments might satisfy persons\nof docile and sober minds, that they ought not to carry their curiosity\nany further, or without the sanction of the word of God, to receive any\nother sacraments beside those two which they know to have been\ninstituted by the Lord. But as the opinion of seven sacraments has been\nso generally admitted in the common conversation of mankind, and\npervaded the controversies of the schools, and the sermons of the\npulpit,—as it has gathered strength from its antiquity, and still keeps\nits hold on the minds of men,—I have thought I should perform a useful\nservice by entering into a closer and distinct examination of the five\nceremonies, which are commonly numbered among the true and genuine\nsacraments of the Lord, by clearing away every fallacy, and exhibiting\nto the view of plain Christians the real nature of those ceremonies, and\nhow falsely they have hitherto been considered as sacraments. Here, in\nthe first place, I wish to declare to all believers, that I am not\ninduced to enter on this controversy respecting the term, by the least\ndesire of contention, but that I am urged by important reasons to resist\nthe abuse of it. I am aware that Christians have power over names as\nwell as things, and may therefore apply words to things at their own\npleasure, provided they retain a pious meaning, even though there be\nsome impropriety of expression. All this I admit, though it would be\nbetter for words to be subject to things, than for things to be subject\nto words. The case of the term _sacrament_, however, is different. For\nthose who maintain seven sacraments, give them all the same\ndefinition—that they are visible forms of invisible grace; they make\nthem all alike vessels of the Holy Spirit, instruments of communicating\nrighteousness, causes of obtaining grace. And the Master of the\nSentences, Lombard, denies that the sacraments of the Mosaic law are\nproperly designated by this appellation; because they did not\ncommunicate that which they prefigured. Is it to be endured, that those\nsymbols, which the Lord consecrated with his own mouth, and which he\nadorned with excellent promises, should not be acknowledged as\nsacraments; and, at the same time, that this honour should be\ntransferred to those rites which are merely inventions of men, or, at\nleast, are observed without any express command of God? Either,\ntherefore, let them change their definition, or abstain from this abuse\nof the term, which afterwards generates false and absurd opinions.\nExtreme unction, they say, is a figure and cause of invisible grace,\nbecause it is a sacrament. If we ought by no means to admit their\ninference from the term, it certainly behoves us to lose no time in\nresisting their application of the term itself, that we may not be\nchargeable with giving any occasion to such an error. Again: to prove\nthat ceremony to be a sacrament, they allege this reason—that it\nconsists of the external sign and the word of God. If we find neither\ncommand nor promise respecting it, can we do otherwise than oppose it?\nII. Now, it appears that we are not debating about the word, but raising\na necessary and useful controversy respecting the thing itself. We must\nstrenuously maintain, therefore, what we have already established by\nirrefragable argument that the power to institute sacraments belongs to\nGod alone; for a sacrament ought to exhibit the certain promise of God,\nfor the assurance and consolation of the consciences of believers; which\ncould never receive such assurance and consolation from man. A sacrament\nought to be a testimony to us of the good-will of God towards us—a\ntestimony which no man or angel can ever give, as none has been “his\ncounsellor.” It is he alone, therefore, who, with legitimate authority,\ntestifies to us concerning himself by means of his word. A sacrament is\na seal by which the testament or promise of God is sealed. But it could\nnot be sealed by corporeal things and the elements of this world, unless\nthey were marked out and appointed for this purpose by the power of God.\nTherefore man cannot institute a sacrament; because it is not in human\npower to cause such great and Divine mysteries to be concealed under\nsuch mean symbols. “The word of God must precede,” as is excellently\nremarked by Augustine, “in order to make a sacrament to be a sacrament.”\nMoreover, if we would avoid falling into many absurdities, it is\nrequisite to preserve some distinction between a sacrament and other\nceremonies. The apostles prayed on bended knees; shall we, therefore,\nnever kneel without making it a sacrament? The early Christians are said\nto have turned their faces towards the east when they prayed; shall\nlooking towards the east, then, be regarded as a sacrament? Paul says,\n“I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,”[1366] and the\nprayers of the saints appear to have been often made with uplifted\nhands; shall elevation of hands also be made a sacrament? On this\nprinciple all the gestures of the saints would become sacraments. I\nwould not insist on these things, however, if they were not connected\nwith those greater inconveniences.\nIII. If they wish to press us with the authority of the ancient Church,\nI assert that this is a groundless pretence. For the number of seven\nsacraments can nowhere be found in the ecclesiastical writers, nor is it\nclear when it was introduced. I grant, indeed, that the fathers\nsometimes make too free a use of the word sacrament; but they use it\nindifferently to signify all ceremonies and external rites, and all\nexercises of piety. But, when they speak of those signs which we ought\nto regard as testimonies of the grace of God, they are content with\nthese two, baptism and the eucharist. That this may not be supposed to\nbe a false allegation, I shall here cite a few testimonies from\nAugustine. To Januarius he says, “First, I wish you to know what is the\nprincipal point of this controversy—that our Lord Jesus Christ, as he\nsays in the gospel, has laid upon us an easy yoke and a light burden.\nAnd, therefore, he has linked together the society of the Christian\nChurch by sacraments, very few in number, most easy to observe, and\nexcellent in signification. Such are baptism, consecrated in the name of\nthe Trinity, and the communion of the body and blood of the Lord, and if\nthere be any other enjoined in the canonical Scriptures.” Again, in his\ntreatise On the Christian Doctrine: “Since the resurrection of our Lord,\nour Lord himself, and the practice of his apostles, instead of many\nsigns, have given us few, and those most easy in performance, most\nexcellent in signification, and most pure in observance; such are\nbaptism, and the celebration of the body and blood of the Lord.” Why\ndoes he make no mention here of the sacred or septenary number? Is it\nprobable that he would have omitted it, if it had then been instituted\nin the Church; especially as, in other cases, he was more curious in the\nobservation of numbers than was at all necessary? And, when he names\nbaptism and the Lord’s supper, and is silent respecting any others, does\nhe not sufficiently indicate, that these two mysteries possess superior\nand peculiar dignity, and that all other ceremonies occupy an inferior\nstation? Wherefore I affirm that these advocates for seven sacraments\nare not only unsupported by the word of the Lord, but also by the\nconsent of the ancient Church, however they may boast of such consent.\nLet us now proceed to the particular ceremonies.\nCONFIRMATION.\nIV. It was an ancient custom in the Church for the children of\nChristians, after they were come to years of discretion, to be presented\nto the bishop in order to fulfil that duty which was required of adults\nwho offered themselves to baptism. For such persons were placed among\nthe catechumens, till, being duly instructed in the mysteries of\nChristianity, they were enabled to make a confession of their faith\nbefore the bishop and all the people. Therefore those who had been\nbaptized in their infancy, because they had not then made such a\nconfession of faith before the Church, at the close of childhood, or the\ncommencement of adolescence, were again presented by their parents, and\nwere examined by the bishop according to the form of the catechism which\nwas then in common use. That this exercise, which deserved to be\nregarded as sacred and solemn, might have the greater dignity and\nreverence, they also practised the ceremony of imposition of hands. Thus\nthe youth, after having given satisfaction respecting his faith, was\ndismissed with a solemn benediction. This custom is frequently mentioned\nby the ancient writers. Leo, the pope, says, “If any one be converted\nfrom heresy, let him not be baptized again; but let the influence of the\nSpirit, which he wanted among the heretics, be communicated to him by\nthe imposition of the hands of the bishop.” Here our adversaries will\nexclaim that any ceremony, by which the Holy Spirit is conferred, is\nproperly denominated a sacrament. But the meaning of Leo in these words\nis sufficiently unfolded by himself in another place: “Whoever is\nbaptized among heretics, let him not be rebaptized; but let him be\nconfirmed by imposition of hands with invocation of the Holy Spirit;\nbecause he has received the mere form of baptism, without the\nsanctification.” It is also mentioned by Jerome against the Luciferians.\nAnd though I confess that Jerome is not altogether correct in stating it\nto have been a custom of the apostles, yet he is very far from the\nabsurdities now maintained by the Romanists; and he even corrects that\nvery statement by adding, that this benediction was committed wholly to\nthe bishops, “rather in honour of the priesthood than from necessity\nimposed by any law.” Such imposition of hands, therefore, as is simply\nconnected with benediction, I highly approve, and wish it were now\nrestored to its primitive use, uncorrupted by superstition.\nV. Succeeding times have almost obliterated that ancient practice, and\nintroduced I know not what counterfeit confirmation as a sacrament of\nGod. They have pretended that the virtue of confirmation is to give the\nHoly Spirit for the augmentation of grace, who in baptism is given for\ninnocence; to strengthen for warfare those who in baptism had been\nregenerated to life. This confirmation is performed by unction and the\nfollowing form of words: “I sign thee with the sign of the cross, and\nconfirm thee with the chrism of salvation, in the name of the Father,\nand of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” All this sounds very\nbeautifully and pleasantly. But where is the word of God which promises\nthe presence of the Holy Spirit in this ceremony? They cannot allege a\nsingle iota. How, then, will they assure us that their chrism is the\nvessel of the Holy Spirit? We see oil, a thick and viscid liquid, and we\nsee nothing besides. Augustine says, “Let the word be added to the\nelement, and it will become a sacrament.” Let the Romanists produce this\nword, if they wish us to contemplate in the oil any thing beyond the oil\nitself. If they acknowledged themselves ministers of the sacraments, as\nthey ought to do, there would be no need of any further contention. The\nfirst law of a minister is to undertake nothing without a command. Now,\nlet them produce any command for this service, and I will not add\nanother word on the subject. If they have no command, they can have no\nexcuse for such sacrilegious audacity. On the same principle, our Lord\ninterrogated the Pharisees: “The baptism of John, whence was it? from\nheaven or of men?”[1367] If they had answered, From men, he would have\nextorted a confession that it was vain and frivolous; if, From heaven,\nthey would be constrained to admit the doctrine of John. To avoid too\ngreat an injury to John, therefore, they did not dare to confess it was\nfrom men. So, if confirmation be “of men,” it is evinced to be vain and\nfrivolous; if they wish to persuade us that it is from heaven, let them\nprove it.\nVI. They defend themselves, indeed, by the example of the apostles, whom\nthey consider as having done nothing without sufficient reason. This\nconsideration is correct; nor would they receive any reprehension from\nus, if they showed themselves imitators of the apostles. But what was\nthe practice of the apostles? Luke relates, that “when the apostles,\nwhich were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of\nGod, they sent unto them Peter and John; who, when they were come down,\nprayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost; for as yet he\nwas fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in the name of the\nLord Jesus. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the\nHoly Ghost.”[1368] And this imposition of hands is mentioned by the\nsacred historian on several occasions. I perceive what the apostles\ndid—that they faithfully executed their ministry. It was the Lord’s\nwill, that those visible and wonderful graces of the Holy Spirit, which\nhe then poured out upon his people, should be administered and\ndistributed by his apostles with imposition of hands. Now, I do not\nconceive that the imposition of hands concealed any higher mystery, but\nam of opinion that this ceremony was employed by them as an external\nexpression of their commending, and, as it were, presenting to God, the\nperson upon whom they laid their hands. If the ministry which was then\nexecuted by the apostles were still continued in the Church, imposition\nof hands ought also to be still observed; but since such grace is no\nlonger conferred, of what use is the imposition of hands? It is true\nthat the people of God still enjoy the presence of the Holy Spirit,\nwhose guidance and direction are indispensable to the existence of the\nChurch. For we have the eternal promise, which can never fail, and in\nwhich Christ has said, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and\ndrink living water.”[1369] But those miraculous powers and manifest\noperations, which were distributed by imposition of hands, have ceased;\nand it was right that they should continue but for a time. For it was\nnecessary that the first preaching of the gospel, and the kingdom of\nChrist, at its commencement, should be illustrated and magnified by\nmiracles never seen or heard before: the subsequent cessation of which\ndoes not argue the Lord’s desertion of his Church, but is equivalent to\na declaration from him that the magnificence of his reign and the\ndignity of his word had been sufficiently manifested. In what respect,\nthen, will these impostors affirm that they imitate the apostles? They\nshould have effected, by imposition of hands, that the evident power of\nthe Spirit might immediately show itself. This they do not practise.\nWhy, then, do they boast that they are countenanced by the imposition of\nhands, which we find was used by the apostles, but for a totally\ndifferent purpose.\nVII. This is just as reasonable as it would be for any one to affirm the\nafflation, with which the Lord breathed upon his disciples, to be a\nsacrament by which the Holy Spirit is conferred.[1370] But though the\nLord did this once, he has never directed it to be done by us. In the\nsame manner, the apostles practised imposition of hands during that\nperiod in which the Lord was pleased to dispense the visible graces of\nthe Holy Spirit in compliance with their prayers; not in order that\npersons in succeeding times might counterfeit a vain and useless sign,\nas a mere piece of mimicry destitute of any reality. Besides, even if\nthey could prove themselves to imitate the apostles in the imposition of\nhands, in which they have nothing similar to the apostles, except this\npreposterous mimicry, whence do they derive their oil, which they call\nthe oil of salvation? Who has taught them to seek salvation in oil? Who\nhas taught them to attribute to it the property of imparting spiritual\nstrength? Is it Paul, who calls us off from the elements of this world,\nand severely condemns an attachment to such observances?[1371] On the\ncontrary, I fearlessly pronounce, not of myself, but from the Lord, that\nthose who call oil the oil of salvation, abjure the salvation which is\nin Christ, reject Christ, and have no part in the kingdom of God. For\noil is for the belly, and the belly for oil; the Lord shall destroy\nboth; all these weak elements “which perish with the using,”[1372] have\nno connection with the kingdom of God, which is spiritual, and shall\nnever perish. What, then, it will be said, do you apply the same rule to\nthe water with which we are baptized, and to the bread and wine used in\nthe Lord’s supper? I answer, that in sacraments of Divine appointment,\ntwo things are to be regarded—the substance of the corporeal symbol\nwhich is proposed to us, and the character impressed upon it by the word\nof God, in which consists all its virtue. Therefore, as the bread, and\nwine, and water, which are presented to our view in the sacraments,\nretain their natural substance, that observation of Paul is always\napplicable: “Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall\ndestroy both it and them;”[1373] for they pass and vanish away with the\nfashion of this world. But as they are sanctified by the word of God to\nbe sacraments, they do not confine us to the flesh, but impart to us\ntrue and spiritual instruction.\nVIII. Let us examine still more narrowly how many monsters are fostered\nby this oil. The dispensers of it say, that the Holy Spirit is given, in\nbaptism for innocence, in confirmation for an augmentation of grace;\nthat in baptism we are regenerated to life, and that by confirmation we\nare armed for warfare; and they have so far lost all shame, as to deny\nthat baptism can be rightly performed without confirmation. What\ncorruption! Are we not, then, “in baptism buried with Christ, planted\ntogether in the likeness of his death,” that we may be “also in the\nlikeness of his resurrection?” Now this fellowship with the death and\nlife of Christ, Paul explains to consist in the mortification of the\nflesh, and the vivification of the Spirit; “that our old man is\ncrucified with him, that we should walk in newness of life.”[1374] What\nis it to be armed for the spiritual warfare, if this be not? If they\ndeemed it of no importance to trample under foot the word of God, why\ndid they not at least reverence the Church, to which they wish to appear\nso uniformly obsequious? But what can be produced more severe against\nthis doctrine of theirs, than the following decree of the Council of\nMilevum? “Whoever asserts that baptism is only given for the remission\nof sins, and not for assistance of future grace, let him be accursed.”\nWhen Luke, in a passage which we have already cited, speaks of some as\nhaving been “baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,”[1375] who had not\nreceived the Holy Ghost, he does not absolutely deny that any gift of\nthe Spirit had been imparted to those persons who had believed in Christ\nwith the heart, and had confessed him with the mouth; he intends that\ngift of the Spirit which communicated his manifest powers and visible\ngraces. So the apostles are said to have received the Holy Spirit on the\nday of Pentecost; though Christ had long before declared to them, “It is\nnot ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father, which speaketh in\nyou.”[1376] Let all who are of God, here observe the malicious and\npestilent artifice of Satan. That which was truly given in baptism, he\nfalsely asserts to be given in his confirmation, with the crafty design\nof seducing us unawares from baptism. Who can doubt, now, that this is\nthe doctrine of Satan, which severs from baptism the promises which\nbelong to that sacrament, and transfers them to something else? It is\nnow discovered on what kind of a foundation this famous unction rests.\nThe word of God is, that “as many as have been baptized into Christ,\nhave put on Christ,”[1377] with his gifts. The word of these anointers\nis, That we have received no promise in baptism to arm us for the\nspiritual warfare. The word of God is the voice of truth; consequently\nthe word of the anointers must be the voice of falsehood. I can,\ntherefore, give a more correct definition of this confirmation than they\nhave yet given of it; namely, that it is a manifest insult against\nbaptism, obscuring and even abolishing its use; that it is a deceitful\npromise of the devil, seducing us from the truth of God; or, if the\nfollowing be preferred, that it is oil polluted with the falsehood of\nthe devil, to darken and deceive the minds of the simple.\nIX. They further assert that all believers after baptism ought to\nreceive the Holy Spirit by imposition of hands, that they may be found\ncomplete Christians; for that no one can be altogether a Christian who\nis never anointed with episcopal confirmation. These are their own\nwords. But I thought that all things relating to Christianity had been\ncomprehended and declared in the Scriptures. Now, it seems, the true\nform of religion is to be sought and learned from some other quarter.\nThe wisdom of God, therefore, celestial truth, all the doctrine of\nChrist, only _begins_ to make Christians; oil _completes_ them. Such a\nsentiment condemns all the apostles, and a number of martyrs who, it is\ncertain, had never received this unction. For the holy chrism, the\nperfusion of which would complete their Christianity, or rather make\nthem Christians from being no Christians at all, had not then been\nmanufactured. But these chrismatics abundantly confute themselves,\nwithout my saying a word. For how small a part of their people do they\nanoint after baptism? Why, then, do they suffer such semi-Christians in\ntheir own community, from an imperfection which they might easily\nremedy? Why do they, with such supine negligence, suffer them to omit\nthat which cannot be omitted without great criminality? Why do they not\nmore rigidly insist upon a thing so necessary and indispensable to\nsalvation, unless any one be prevented by sudden death? Surely while\nthey suffer it to be so easily despised, they tacitly confess it not to\nbe of so much importance as they pretend it to be.\nX. In the last place, they determine that this sacred unction ought to\nbe held in greater reverence than baptism; because it is only dispensed\nby the hands of the greatest prelates, whereas baptism is commonly\nadministered by all priests. Must they not be considered as evidently\nmad, who discover such fondness for their own inventions, that, in\ncomparison with them, they presume to undervalue the sacred institutions\nof God? Sacrilegious mouth, dost thou dare to place an unction, which is\nonly defiled with thy fetid breath, and enchanted by the muttering of a\nfew words, on a level with the sacrament of Christ, and to compare it\nwith water sanctified by the word of God? But this would not satisfy thy\npresumption; thou hast even given it the preference! These are the\nresponses of the Holy See; they are the oracles of the apostolic tripod.\nBut some of them have begun to moderate this infatuation, which even in\ntheir opinion was carried beyond all due limits. Confirmation is to be\nregarded, they say, with greater reverence than baptism; not, perhaps,\nfor the greater virtue and advantage that it confers, but because it is\ndispensed by persons of superior dignity, and is applied to the nobler\npart of the body, that is, the forehead; or because it contributes a\ngreater augmentation of virtues, though baptism is more available to\nremission. But in the first reason, do they not betray themselves to be\nDonatists, who estimate the virtue of the sacrament by the dignity or\nworthiness of the minister? I will grant, however, that confirmation be\nconsidered as more excellent from the dignity of episcopal hands. But if\nany one inquire of them how such a prerogative has been conferred on\nbishops, what reason will they assign but their own pleasure? They\nallege, that the apostles alone exercised that right, being the sole\ndispensers of the Holy Spirit. Are bishops the only apostles; or are\nthey apostles at all? Let us, however, grant that also; why do they not\non the same principle contend that none but bishops ought to touch the\nsacrament of the blood in the Lord’s supper; which they refuse to the\nlaity, because the Lord, as they say, only gave it to the apostles? If\nour Lord gave it to the apostles alone, why do they not infer, Therefore\nit ought now to be given to bishops alone? But in this case they make\nthe apostles simple presbyters; now, they are hurried away with an\nextravagant notion suddenly to create them bishops. Lastly, Ananias was\nnot an apostle; yet to him Paul was sent, that he might receive his\nsight, be baptized, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.[1378] I will add\none question more: If this was the peculiar office of bishops by a\nDivine right, why have they dared to transfer it to common presbyters,\nas we read in one of the epistles of Gregory?\nXI. How frivolous and foolish is the second reason, That they call their\nconfirmation more excellent than the baptism instituted by God, because\nin confirmation the forehead is anointed with oil, and in baptism the\ncrown of the head; as though baptism were performed with oil, and not\nwith water! I appeal to all believers, whether these deceivers do not\ndirect all their efforts to this one object; to corrupt the purity of\nthe sacraments by the leaven of their false doctrine. I have already\nremarked, in another part of this book, that in the sacraments it is\nscarcely possible to discern that which is of Divine institution among\nthe multiplicity of human inventions. If any one did not give credit to\nthat observation of mine, let him now at least believe his own masters.\nBy their passing over the water without the least notice, it appears\nthat the only thing to which they attribute much importance in baptism,\nis their own oil. We, therefore, on the contrary, affirm, that in\nbaptism the forehead also is laved with water. In comparison with this,\nwe esteem all their oil perfectly worthless, whether in baptism or in\nconfirmation. If any one allege that it is sold for more, this accession\nof price would only corrupt the good, if it contained any; an imposture\nof the foulest kind can never be legalized by robbery. In the third\nreason, they expose their impiety, when they pretend that a greater\naugmentation of virtues is conferred in confirmation than in baptism.\nThe apostles, by imposition of hands, dispensed the visible graces of\nthe Spirit. In what respect does their unction appear to be productive\nof any advantage? Let us leave these moderators, therefore, who cover\none sacrilege with a number of others. It is a Gordian knot, which it is\nbetter to cut asunder than to spend much labour to untie.\nXII. Now, when they find themselves stripped of the word of God, and of\nevery probable argument, they resort to their usual pretext, that it is\na very ancient usage, and confirmed by the consent of many ages. Though\nthis allegation were true, it would not at all serve their cause. A\nsacrament is not from earth, but from heaven; not of men, but of God\nalone. If they wish their confirmation to be regarded as a sacrament,\nthey must prove God to be the Author of it. But why do they allege\nantiquity, seeing that the ancient fathers, whenever they mean to\nexpress themselves with strict propriety, nowhere enumerate more than\ntwo sacraments? If it were necessary to fortify our faith by the\nauthority of men, we have an impregnable fortress, that those\nceremonies, which our adversaries falsely pretend to be sacraments, were\nnever acknowledged as sacraments by the ancients. The fathers speak of\nimposition of hands; but do they call it a sacrament? Augustine\nexplicitly affirms that it is no other than prayer. Here let them not\noppose me with their foolish distinctions, that Augustine applied this\nremark to imposition of hands, not as practised in confirmation, but as\nused for the purpose of healing, or of reconciliation. The book is\nextant, and is in many hands. If I pervert the passage to any meaning\ndifferent from that of Augustine himself, I am content to submit to\ntheir severest censure and contempt. For he is speaking of schismatics,\nwho returned to the unity of the Church; and denies that they have any\nneed of the reiteration of baptism, for that imposition of hands was\nsufficient, in order that, by the bond of peace, the Lord might give\nthem his Holy Spirit. And as it might appear unreasonable to repeat\nimposition of hands rather than baptism, he shows the difference. “For\nwhat,” he says, “is imposition of hands, but prayer over a man?” And\nthat this was his meaning, is evident from another passage, where he\nsays, “We lay hands upon reclaimed heretics, for the union of charity,\nwhich is the principal gift of the Holy Spirit, and without which\nwhatever else may be holy in man is unavailing to salvation.”\nXIII. I sincerely wish that we retained the custom, which I have stated\nwas practised among the ancients before this abortive image of a\nsacrament made its appearance. For it was not such a confirmation as the\nRomanists pretend, which cannot be mentioned without injury to baptism;\nbut a catechetical exercise, in which children or youths used to deliver\nan account of their faith in the presence of the Church. Now, it would\nbe the best mode of catechetical instruction, if a formulary were\nwritten for this purpose, containing and stating, in a familiar manner,\nall the articles of our religion, in which the universal Church of\nbelievers ought to agree, without any controversy: a boy of ten years of\nage might present himself to make a confession of his faith; he might be\nquestioned on all the articles, and might give suitable answers: if he\nwere ignorant of any, or did not fully understand them, he should be\ntaught. Thus the Church would witness his profession of the only true\nand pure faith, in which all the community of believers unanimously\nworship the one God. If this discipline were observed in the present\nday, it would certainly sharpen the inactivity of some parents, who\ncarelessly neglect the instruction of their children as a thing in which\nthey have no concern, but which, in that case, they could not omit\nwithout public disgrace; there would be more harmony of faith among\nChristian people, nor would many betray such great ignorance and want of\ninformation; some would not be so easily carried away with novel and\nstrange tenets; in short, all would have a regular acquaintance with\nChristian doctrine.\nPENANCE.\nXIV. In the next place, they add penance; of which they treat in such a\nconfused and disorderly manner, that the consciences of men can deduce\nno certain or solid conclusion respecting their doctrine. In another\npart of this treatise, we have stated at large what we learn from the\nScriptures respecting repentance, and likewise what is inculcated on\nthat subject by the Romanists. Our present business is only to inquire\nbriefly into the reasons of those persons who promulgated the opinion\nwhich has prevailed for a long period in the churches and in the\nschools, that penance is a sacrament. In the first place, I will make a\nfew remarks on the practice of the ancient Church, the pretence of which\nthey have abused for the introduction and establishment of their foolish\ninvention. The order observed by the ancients in public penitence was,\nthat persons who had completed the satisfactions enjoined upon them,\nwere reconciled to the Church by solemn imposition of hands. This was a\nsign of absolution, to encourage the sinner himself with an assurance of\npardon before God, and to admonish the Church that they ought to\nobliterate the memory of his offence, and kindly to receive him into\nfavour. This Cyprian often calls “giving peace.” To increase the\nimportance of this act, and give it a greater recommendation among the\npeople, it was ordained that it should always be done by the authority\nof a bishop. Hence that decree of the second Council of Carthage: “Let\nno presbyter be permitted to reconcile a penitent publicly at the mass.”\nAnd another decree of the Council of Arausium: “Let those who, during\nthe period of their penitence, depart out of this life, be admitted to\nthe communion without the reconciliatory imposition of hands. If they\nrecover from their illness, let them complete the period of their\npenitence, and then let them receive from the bishop the reconciliatory\nimposition of hands.” Also the decree of the third Council of Carthage:\n“Let not a presbyter reconcile a penitent without the authority of the\nbishop.” The design of all these decrees was, to prevent the severity\nwhich they wished to preserve in this matter from falling into disuse.\nTherefore they committed it to the cognizance of the bishop, who was\nlikely to be more circumspect in conducting the examination. But Cyprian\nstates that it was not the bishop alone who laid hands on the penitent,\nbut that all the clergy also united in this act. These are his words:\n“They do penance for a proper time, and then they come to the communion,\nand are restored to the right of communion by the imposition of the\nhands of the bishop and clergy.” Afterwards, in process of time, the\ncustom was corrupted, so that they used this ceremony in private\nabsolutions, without any public expression of penitence. Hence that\ndistinction in Gratian, between public and private reconciliation. I\nconsider that ancient custom, which is mentioned by Cyprian, to have\nbeen holy and useful to the Church, and could wish it were revived in\nthe present day. This more recent one, though I venture not to condemn\nor censure it with severity, yet I consider less necessary. We see,\nhowever, that imposition of hands on repentance is a ceremony of human,\nnot of Divine institution, and is to be placed among indifferent things\nand external exercises, such as are not to be despised, but ought to\nhold a station far below the sacraments, which are enjoined upon us by\nthe word of God.\nXV. Now, the Romish theologians and schoolmen, who are in the habit of\ncorrupting every thing by misinterpretation, take very great pains here\nto discover a sacrament, but to no purpose. Nor ought this to be\nwondered at, for they seek it where it is not to be found. When they\nhave done their best, they leave the subject perplexed, doubtful,\nuncertain, and confounded with a variety of opinions. They say, then,\nthat external penitence is a sacrament, and if it be so, that it ought\nto be considered as a sign of internal penitence, that is, of contrition\nof heart, which is the substance of the sacrament; or that both together\nconstitute the sacrament, not two sacraments, but one complete one; but\nthat external penitence is merely the sacrament; while that which is\ninternal is both the sacrament and the substance of the sacrament; and\nremission of sins is the substance only, and not the sacrament. Let\nthose who bear in mind the definition of a sacrament which we have\nalready given, apply it to the examination of this pretended sacrament,\nand they will find that it is not an external ceremony instituted by God\nfor the confirmation of our faith. If they plead that my definition is\nnot a law which they are bound to obey, let them hear Augustine, whom\nthey profess to regard with the greatest reverence. He says, “Visible\nsacraments are instituted for carnal persons, that by the steps of the\nsacraments they may be led from those things which are visible to the\neye, to those which are intelligible to the mind.” What resemblance to\nthis do they themselves see, or are they able to point out to others, in\nthat which they call the sacrament of penance? The same writer says in\nanother place, “It is therefore called a sacrament, because one thing is\nseen, another is understood in it. That which is seen has corporeal\nform; that which is understood has spiritual fruit.” These things are\nnot at all applicable to the sacrament of penance, which they have\ninvented, in which there is no corporeal form to represent any spiritual\nfruit.\nXVI. And to vanquish these champions on their own ground, if any\nsacrament be sought for here, would it not be far more plausible to say\nthat the sacrament consists in the absolution of the priest, rather than\nin penitence, either internal or external? For it would be easy to say,\nthat this is a ceremony appointed for the confirmation of our faith in\nthe remission of sins, and has what they call the promise of the keys:\n“Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and\nwhatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.”[1379]\nBut some would have objected, that many who are absolved by priests,\nderive no such benefits from their absolution; whereas, upon their\nprinciple, the sacraments of the new law actually accomplish that which\nthey represent. To this it might be replied, that, as in the eucharist\nthere is a twofold eating,—sacramental, which is equally common to the\ngood and the wicked; and spiritual, which is peculiar to the good—why\nmight they not also imagine the reception of a twofold absolution? Yet I\nhave never yet been able to comprehend what they intended by that\nprinciple of theirs, respecting the efficacious virtue of the sacraments\nof the new law; which we have proved to be altogether at variance with\nthe truth of God, when we professedly discussed that subject. Here I\nonly mean to show that this difficulty is no objection to their calling\nsacerdotal absolution a sacrament. For they might answer, in the\nlanguage of Augustine, “That sanctification is sometimes without the\nvisible sacrament, and that the visible sacrament is sometimes\nunaccompanied by internal sanctification.” Again: “That the sacraments\neffect that which they represent in the elect alone.” Again: “That some\npersons put on Christ as far as the reception of the sacrament, and\nothers even to sanctification;” that the former is equally the case with\nthe good and evil; and the latter with none but the good. Surely they\nhave betrayed more than the weakness of children, and shown themselves\nblind to the broad day, who, in the midst of such difficulty and\nperplexity, have not discovered a thing so plain and obvious to every\none.\nXVII. Yet let them not flatter themselves, for in whatever part they\nplace their sacrament, I deny that it ought to be considered as a\nsacrament at all; first, because it is not accompanied with any special\npromise of God, which is the only foundation of a sacrament; secondly,\nbecause all the ceremony exhibited here is the mere invention of men;\nwhereas it has been already ascertained that sacramental ceremonies\ncannot be instituted, except by God himself. All that they have\nfabricated, therefore, respecting the sacrament of penance, is nothing\nbut falsehood and imposture. This counterfeit sacrament they have\nadorned with a suitable title, calling it “a second plank after a\nshipwreck;” for that, if any one by sin has soiled the garment of\ninnocence received in baptism, he may purify it by penance. But this,\nthey say, is the language of Jerome. Whose language soever it may be, it\ncannot be exculpated from manifest impiety, if it be explained according\nto their notion of it. As if baptism were effaced by sin, and ought not\nrather to be recalled to the memory of the sinner whenever he thinks of\nremission of sins, that it may serve to comfort his mind, inspire him\nwith courage, and confirm his confidence of obtaining the remission of\nsins, which was promised to him in baptism. But that which Jerome has\nexpressed with some degree of harshness and impropriety, that baptism,\nfrom which those who deserve to be excommunicated from the Church have\nfallen away, is repaired by penitence, these admirable expositors apply\nto their impiety. We shall speak with the greatest propriety, therefore,\nif we call baptism the sacrament of penitence; since it is given for a\nconfirmation of grace, and seal of confidence, to those who meditate\nrepentance. And this must not be considered as an invention of ours,\nfor, beside its conformity to the language of Scripture, it appears to\nhave been generally received in the ancient Church as an indubitable\naxiom. For in the treatise on Faith addressed to Peter, which is\nattributed to Augustine, it is called “the sacrament of faith and\nrepentance.” And why do we resort to uncertain testimonies? Nothing can\nbe required more explicit than what is recited by the evangelists, that\n“John did preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of\nsins.”[1380]\nEXTREME UNCTION.\nXVIII. The third counterfeit sacrament is extreme unction; which is\nnever performed but by a priest, and that in the last moments of life,\nwith oil consecrated by a bishop, and the following form of words: “By\nthis holy unction, and by his most tender mercy, may God pardon thee\nwhatever sin thou hast committed by sight, by hearing, by smell, by\ntaste, and by touch.” They pretend that it has two virtues—remission of\nsins, and relief from bodily disease, if that be expedient, or otherwise\nthe salvation of the soul. They say that the institution of it is\nestablished by James, who says, “Is any sick among you? let him call for\nthe elders of the Church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with\noil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall save the\nsick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins,\nthey shall be forgiven him.”[1381] This unction of theirs is of the same\nkind as we have already proved their imposition of hands to be: it is a\nmere hypocritical farce, by which, without any reason, and without any\nadvantage, they affect to mimic the apostles. It is related by Mark,\nthat the apostles, at their first mission, according to the command\nwhich they had received from the Lord, raised the dead, ejected demons,\ncleansed lepers, healed the sick, and that in the cure of the sick they\nmade use of oil. “They anointed with oil,” he says, “many that were\nsick, and healed them.”[1382] James had this in view when he directed\nthe elders of the Church to be sent for to anoint the sick. That such\nceremonies concealed no higher mystery, will easily be concluded by any\nattentive observers of the great liberty used by our Lord and his\napostles in external things. When our Lord was about to restore sight to\na blind man, he made clay of dust and spittle; some he healed with a\ntouch, others with a word. In the same manner, the apostles cured some\nmaladies with a mere word, others with a touch, others with unction. But\nit may be alleged that it is probable that this unction, like the other\nmethods, was not employed without reason. This I confess; not, however,\nthat they used it as an instrument of cure, but merely as a sign, to\ninstruct the ignorance of the simple whence such virtue proceeded, that\nthey might not ascribe the praise of it to the apostles. Now, it is very\ncommon in the Scriptures for the Holy Spirit and his gifts to be\nsignified by oil. But that grace of healing has disappeared, like all\nthe other miraculous powers, which the Lord was pleased to exhibit for a\ntime, that he might render the preaching of the gospel, which was then\nnew, the object of admiration for ever. Even though we should fully\ngrant, therefore, that unction was a sacrament of the powers which were\nadministered by the instrumentality of the apostles, it has nothing to\ndo with us, to whom the administration of those powers has not been\ncommitted.\nXIX. And what greater reason have they to make a sacrament of this\nunction than of all the other signs or symbols which are mentioned in\nthe Scriptures? Why do not they appoint some pool of Siloam, in which\nthe sick may bathe themselves at certain seasons?[1383] That, they say,\nwould be a vain attempt. Surely not more in vain than unction. Why do\nthey not “fall upon and embrace” the dead, because Paul resuscitated a\ndeceased young man by such means?[1384] Why is not clay, composed of\nspittle and dust, converted into a sacrament? All the others, they say,\nwere single examples, but the use of unction is commanded by James. I\nreply, that James was speaking in reference to that period in which this\nbenediction of God was still enjoyed by the Church. They affirm, indeed,\nthat there is even now the same virtue in their unction; but we find it\nto be otherwise by experience. Let no one now wonder how they have so\nconfidently deluded souls, whom they know to be stupid and blind when\ndeprived of the word of God, which is their life and light, since they\nare not at all ashamed to attempt to deceive the living and observing\nsenses of the body. They make themselves ridiculous, therefore, when\nthey boast that they are endued with the gift of healing. The Lord is\nundoubtedly present with his people to assist them in all ages; and,\nwhenever it is necessary, he heals their diseases as much as he did in\nancient times; but he does not display those visible powers, or dispense\nmiracles by the hands of apostles; because that gift was only of\ntemporary duration, and was soon lost, in some measure, by the\ningratitude of men.\nXX. As the apostles, therefore, had sufficient cause for using the\nsymbol of oil as an evident testimony that the gift of healing, which\nhad been committed to them, was not a power of their own, but of the\nHoly Spirit, so, on the other hand, they do a great injury to the Holy\nSpirit who represent a fetid oil, destitute of all efficacy, as his\npower. This is just as if any one were to affirm, that all oil is the\npower of the Holy Spirit, because it is called by that name in the\nScripture; or that every dove is the Holy Spirit, because he appeared\nunder that form. But let them look to these things. For us, it is\nsufficient, at present, that we see beyond all doubt that their unction\nis not a sacrament, being a ceremony which is neither of God’s\ninstitution, nor accompanied with any promise from him. For when we\nrequire these two things in a sacrament, that it be a ceremony\ninstituted by God, and that it have some promise of God, we at the same\ntime require that the ceremony be enjoined upon us, and that the promise\nhave reference to us. For no one contends that circumcision is now a\nsacrament of the Christian Church, notwithstanding it was instituted by\nGod, and had a promise annexed to it; because it is not enjoined upon\nus, nor is the promise which was subjoined to it given to us on that\ncondition. That the promise which they presumptuously boast of in their\nunction is not given to us, we have clearly proved, and they themselves\ndeclare by experience. The ceremony ought not to have been used, except\nby those who were endued with the gift of healing; and not by these\nbutchers, who are more capable of killing and murdering than of healing.\nXXI. Even if they had established, what they are very far from having\nestablished, that the injunction of James respecting unction is\napplicable to the present age, still they would have made but little\nprogress in defending their unction with which they have hitherto\nbesmeared us. James directs that all sick persons be anointed; these men\nbedaub with their unguent not sick persons, but half-dead corpses, when\ntheir souls are at the point of departing from them. If in their\nsacrament they have a present medicine, by which they can either\nalleviate the anguish of disease, or at least communicate some\nconsolation to the soul, they are cruel never to apply the remedy in\ntime. James directs, that the sick person be anointed by the elders of\nthe Church; these men admit no anointer but a priest. Their explanation\nthat the term _elders_ denotes priests, and the plural number is used\nfor the sake of dignity, is frivolous in the extreme; as though the\nChurches in that age abounded with priests, to be able to march in a\nlong procession, carrying their box of consecrated oil. When James\nsimply commands that sick persons be anointed, he appears to me to\nintend no other unction than of common oil; nor is any other mentioned\nin the narrative of Mark. These men deign to use no oil which has not\nbeen consecrated by the bishop; that is, warmed with his breath,\nenchanted by his muttering, and nine times saluted by him on bended\nknees; three times, _Hail, holy oil_; three times, _Hail, holy chrism_;\nthree times, _Hail, holy balm_. From whom have they derived such\nincantations? James says, that when the elders shall have prayed over\nthe sick person, anointing him with oil, if he have committed sins they\nshall be forgiven him; that, being absolved from guilt, he may obtain\nrelief from pain; not meaning that sins are effaced by unction, but that\nthe prayers of the believers, by which the afflicted brother shall have\nbeen commended to God, shall not be in vain. These men impiously\npretend, that sins are remitted by their holy, or, to speak more\nproperly, abominable unction. See what lengths they will go, when they\nshall be allowed to abuse that passage of James by their absurd\ninterpretation. And we need not labour any longer in the proof; even\ntheir own histories relieve us from this difficulty. For they relate,\nthat Pope Innocent, who presided over the Church of Rome in the time of\nAugustine, decreed that not only elders, but also all Christians, should\nuse oil, in case of illness, for the purpose of anointing themselves or\ntheir friends.\nECCLESIASTICAL ORDERS.\nXXII. The fourth place in their catalogue is occupied by the sacrament\nof orders; but this is so fertile that it is the parent of seven little\nsacraments which arise out of it. Now, it is truly ridiculous for them\nto affirm, that there are _seven_ sacraments, and when they proceed to\nspecify them, to enumerate _thirteen_. Nor can they plead, that the\nseven sacraments of orders are only one sacrament, because they all\nbelong to one priesthood, and form, as it were, so many steps to it.\nFor, as it appears that in all of them there are different ceremonies,\nand they themselves say that there are different graces, no person can\ndoubt that, if their principles be admitted, they ought to be called\nseven sacraments. And why do we controvert it as a doubtful thing, when\nthey themselves plainly and distinctly declare that there are seven? In\nthe first place, we will briefly suggest by the way what numerous and\ngreat absurdities they obtrude upon us, when they wish us to receive\ntheir orders as sacraments; and then we will inquire, whether the\nceremony which the churches use in ordaining ministers ought to be\ncalled a sacrament at all. They mention seven ecclesiastical orders or\ndegrees, which they dignify with the name of sacrament. They\nare—beadles, readers, exorcists, acolothists, subdeacons, deacons,\npriests. And they are seven, it is said, on account of the sevenfold\ngrace of the Holy Spirit, with which those who are promoted to them\nought to be endued; but it is increased, and more abundantly\ncommunicated to them, in their promotion. Now, the number itself is\nconsecrated by a perverse interpretation of the Scripture; because they\nthink they have read in Isaiah of seven virtues of the Holy Spirit;\nthough, in truth, that prophet mentions only six, and had no intention\nof enumerating them all in that passage; for in other passages of\nScripture, he is called “the Spirit of life, of holiness, and of\nadoption,” as he is there called “the Spirit of wisdom and\nunderstanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge,\nand of the fear of the Lord.”[1385] Other persons of greater subtlety\nlimit not the orders to seven, but extend them to nine, in resemblance,\nthey say, of the church triumphant. And they are not agreed among\nthemselves; for some represent the clerical tonsure to be the first\norder of all, and the episcopate the last: others exclude the tonsure,\nand place the archiepiscopal office among the orders. Isidore\ndistinguishes them in a different way; for he makes psalmists and\nreaders two separate orders, appointing the former to the chantings, and\nthe latter to the reading of the Scriptures, for the instruction of the\npeople. And this distinction is observed in the canons. In such a\ndiversity, what do they wish us to pursue or to avoid? Shall we say that\nthere are seven orders? So teaches the master of the sentences, Lombard;\nbut the most illuminated doctors determine otherwise; and these doctors\ndiffer among themselves. Moreover, the most sacred canons call us\nanother way. This is the harmony exhibited by men, when they discuss\nDivine subjects without the word of God.\nXXIII. But this surpasses all folly, that in every one of their orders\nthey make Christ a colleague with them. First, they say, he executed the\noffice of beadle, when he made a whip of small cords, and drove all the\nbuyers and sellers out of the temple. He showed himself to be a beadle,\nwhen he said, “I am the door.” He assumed the place of a reader, when he\nread a passage of Isaiah in the synagogue. He discharged the function of\nan exorcist, when, applying spittle to the ears and tongue of a man who\nwas deaf and dumb, he restored his hearing and speech. He declared\nhimself to be an acolothist in these words: “He that followeth me shall\nnot walk in darkness.” He discharged the duty of a subdeacon, when he\ngirded himself with a towel, and washed the feet of his disciples. He\nsustained the character of a deacon, when he distributed his body and\nblood in the supper. He acted the part of a priest, when he offered\nhimself on the cross a sacrifice to the Father. It is impossible to hear\nthese things without laughing, so that I wonder they were written\nwithout laughing; at least, if those who wrote them were men. But the\nmost remarkable of all is, the subtlety with which they reason on the\nword _acolothist_, which they call _ceroferarius_, a taper-bearer; a\nterm of magic, I suppose, certainly unknown in any nation or language;\nwhereas the Greek word ακολουθος, _acolothist_, simply signifies a\n_follower_ or _attendant_. But I should justly incur ridicule myself, if\nI were to dwell on a serious refutation of such things, they are so\nfrivolous and ludicrous.\nXXIV. To prevent them, however, from continuing their impositions on\nsilly women, it is necessary, as we proceed, to expose their vanity.\nThey create with great pomp and solemnity their readers, psalmists,\nbeadles, acolothists, to discharge those offices in which they employ\neither boys, or at least those whom they call laymen. For who, in most\ncases, lights the wax tapers, who pours wine and water out of the\nflagon, but a boy, or some mean layman, who gets his livelihood by it?\nDo not the same persons chant? Do they not open and shut the doors of\nthe churches? For who ever saw in their temples an acolothist or beadle\nperforming his office? On the contrary, he who, when a boy, discharged\nthe duty of an acolothist, as soon as he is admitted into that order,\nceases to be what he begins to be called; so that it should seem to be\ntheir deliberate intention to discard the office when they assume the\ntitle. We see what need they have to be consecrated by sacraments, and\nto receive the Holy Spirit; it is, that they may do nothing. If they\nallege, that this arises from the perverseness of the present age, that\nmen desert and neglect their official duties, let them at the same time\nconfess, that their holy orders, which they so wonderfully extol, are of\nno use or benefit to the Church in the present day, and that their whole\nChurch is filled with a curse, since it permits boys and laymen to\nhandle the tapers and flagons, which none are worthy of touching except\nthose who have been consecrated as acolothists; and since it leaves boys\nto chant those services, which ought never to be heard but from a\nconsecrated mouth. But for what purpose do they consecrate their\nexorcists? I know that the Jews had their exorcists; but I find that\nthey derived their name from the exorcisms which they practised.\nRespecting these counterfeit exorcists, who ever heard of their\nexhibiting one specimen of their profession? It is pretended that they\nare invested with power to lay hands upon maniacs, demoniacs, and\ncatechumens; but they cannot persuade the demons that they are endued\nwith such power; not only because the demons do not submit to their\ncommands, but because they even exercise dominion over them. For\nscarcely one in ten can be found among them who is not influenced by an\nevil spirit. Whatever ridiculous pretensions they may set up respecting\ntheir contemptible orders, are the mere compositions of ignorance and\nfalsehood. Of the ancient acolothists, beadles, and readers, we have\nspoken already, when we discussed the order of the Church. Our present\ndesign is only to combat that novel invention of a sevenfold sacrament\nin ecclesiastical orders; on which not a syllable is any where to be\nfound, except among those sapient theologues, the Sorbonists and\nCanonists.\nXXV. Let us now examine the ceremonies which they employ. In the first\nplace, all whom they enrol in their army they initiate into the rank of\nclergy by a common sign. They shave them on the crown of the head, that\nthe crown may denote regal dignity; because ecclesiastics ought to be\nkings, to rule themselves and others, according to the language in which\nPeter addresses them: “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a\nholy nation, a peculiar people.” But it was sacrilege for them to\narrogate exclusively to themselves that which is attributed to the whole\nChurch, and proudly to glory in the title which they had stolen from the\nbelievers. Peter addresses the whole Church; they misapply his words to\na few shavelings, as if they were the only holy persons, as if they\nalone had been redeemed by the blood of Christ, as if they alone had\nbeen made by him kings and priests unto God. They proceed to assign\nother reasons; that the top of their head is laid bare, to show that\ntheir mind is free to the Lord, and can with open face contemplate the\nglory of God; or to indicate that the faults of their mouth and eyes\nought to be cut off. Or the tonsure of the crown signifies the\nrelinquishment and renunciation of temporal things; and the hair left\nround the crown denotes the relics of property which are reserved for\ntheir sustenance. Every thing is symbolical; because, with respect to\nthem, the veil of the temple has not yet been rent asunder. Therefore,\nhaving persuaded themselves that they have completely discharged their\nduties, when they have represented such things by their shaven crown,\nthey, in reality, fulfil none of them. How long will they impose upon us\nwith such deceptions and falsehoods? Ecclesiastics, by shaving off a few\nhairs, signify that they have relinquished an abundance of temporal\npossessions, to be at liberty to contemplate the glory of God, and that\nthey have mortified the inordinate propensities of their ears and eyes;\nbut there is no class of men more rapacious, ignorant, or libidinous.\nWhy do they not make an actual exhibition of sanctity, rather than\ncounterfeit the appearance of it by false and delusive symbols?\nXXVI. When they say that their clerical tonsure derives its origin and\nreason from the Nazarites, what is this but declaring that their\nmysteries have sprung from Jewish ceremonies, or, rather, are mere\nJudaism? But when they add, that Priscilla, Aquila, and Paul himself,\nafter having made a vow, shaved their heads in order to purify\nthemselves, they betray their gross ignorance. For this is nowhere said\nof Priscilla; and there is some uncertainty even respecting Aquila; for\nthat tonsure may as well be referred to Paul as to Aquila.[1386] But not\nto leave them what they require, that they have an example of this\ntonsure in Paul, it ought to be observed by the plain reader, that Paul\nnever shaved his head with a view to any sanctity, but merely to\naccommodate himself to the weakness of his brethren. I am accustomed to\ncall vows of this kind vows of charity, and not of piety; that is to\nsay, they were not made for any purpose of religion, or as acts of\nservice to God, but in order to bear the ignorance of weak brethren; as\nthe apostle himself says: “Unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might\ngain the Jews.”[1387] Therefore he did this act, and that once, and for\na short period, that he might accommodate himself to the Jews. When\nthese men desire, without any cause, to imitate the purifications of the\nNazarites, what is this but raising up a new Judaism by a culpable\naffectation of emulating that which is abolished? The same superstition\ndictated that decretal epistle which prohibits ecclesiastics, according\nto the apostle, to let their hair grow, but enjoins them to shave in a\ncircular form; as though the apostle, when he mentioned what is becoming\nto all men, were concerned about the circular tonsure of the clergy.\nHence the readers may form some opinion of the importance and dignity of\nother succeeding mysteries, to which there is such an introduction.\nXXVII. The true origin of the clerical tonsure is very evident from the\ntestimony of Augustine. As, in that age, no persons suffered their hair\nto grow long, but such as were effeminate, and affected an elegance and\ndelicacy not sufficiently manly, it was thought that it would be a bad\nexample to permit this custom in the clergy. They were, therefore,\ncommanded to shave their heads, that they might exhibit no appearance of\neffeminate ornament. The tonsure then became so common, that some monks,\nto display their superior sanctity by something remarkable and\ndistinguished from others, left their hair to grow very long.\nAfterwards, when the custom of wearing long hair was revived, and\nseveral nations were converted to Christianity, who had always been\naccustomed to wear their hair, as France, Germany, and England, it is\nprobable that ecclesiastics every where shaved their heads, that they\nmight not appear to be fond of the ornament of hair. At length, in a\nmore corrupt age, when all the ancient institutions were either\nperverted or degenerated into superstition, because they saw no reason\nin the clerical tonsure (for they had retained nothing but a foolish\nimitation of their predecessors,) they had recourse to a mystery, which\nthey now superstitiously obtrude upon us as a proof of their sacrament.\nBeadles, at their consecration, receive the keys of the Church, as a\nsign that the custody of it is committed to them. Readers are presented\nwith the Holy Bible. To exorcists are given the forms of exorcisms to be\nused over catechumens and maniacs. Acolothists receive their tapers and\nflagons. These are the ceremonies which, if we believe them, contain\nsuch secret virtue as to be, not only signs and tokens, but even causes,\nof an invisible grace. For, according to their definition, all this is\nassumed when they insist on their being numbered among the sacraments.\nBut, to conclude in a few words, I maintain it to be absurd for\ncanonists and scholastic theologues to give the title of sacraments to\nthese, which they themselves call _lesser orders_; since, even according\nto their own confession, they were unknown to the primitive Church, and\nwere invented many years after. But, as sacraments contain some promises\nof God, they cannot be instituted by men or angels, but by God alone,\nwhose prerogative it is to give the promise.\nXXVIII. There remain three orders, which they call _greater orders_; of\nwhich sub-deaconry, they say, was transferred to this class after the\nnumber of the lesser orders began to increase. As they think that they\nhave a testimony for these from the word of God, they peculiarly\ndenominate them, for the sake of honour, _holy orders_. But we must now\nexamine how perversely they abuse the Divine appointments of God in\ntheir own vindication. We will begin with the order of presbyters, or\npriests. For by these two names they signify one thing; and these are\nthe appellations which they apply to those whose office, they say, it\nis, to offer the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ upon the\naltar, to say prayers and to pronounce benedictions on the gifts of God.\nTherefore, at their ordination, they receive a chalice, with the patine\nand host, as symbols of the power committed to them to offer expiatory\nsacrifices to God; and their hands are anointed with oil, as a symbol to\nshow that they are invested with power to consecrate. The ceremonies we\nshall notice hereafter. Of the thing itself, I affirm, that it is so far\nfrom having a syllable of the Divine word to support it, that it was\nimpossible for them to have introduced a viler corruption of the order\ninstituted by God. In the first place, it ought to be taken for granted,\nas we have shown in the preceding chapter, on the Papal Mass, that great\ninjury is done to Christ by all those who call themselves priests to\noffer sacrifices of expiation. He was constituted and consecrated by the\nFather, with an oath, a priest after the order of Melchisedec, without\nend, and without a successor. He once offered a sacrifice of eternal\nexpiation and reconciliation; and now, having entered into the sanctuary\nof heaven, intercedes for us. In him we are all priests; but it is only\nto offer to God praises and thanksgivings, in short, ourselves and all\nthat belongs to us. It was his province alone, by his oblation, to\nappease God and expiate sins. When these men usurp that office to\nthemselves, what follows, but that their priesthood is chargeable with\nimpiety and sacrilege? They certainly betray the greatest effrontery\nwhen they dare to dignify it with the title of a sacrament. The\nimposition of hands, which is used at the introduction of the true\npresbyters and ministers of the Church into their office, I have no\nobjection to consider as a sacrament; for, in the first place, that\nceremony is taken from the Scripture, and, in the next place, it is\ndeclared by Paul to be not unnecessary or useless, but a faithful symbol\nof spiritual grace.[1388] I have not enumerated it as the third among\nthe sacraments, because it is not ordinary or common to all believers,\nbut a special rite for a particular office. The ascription of this\nhonour to the Christian ministry, however, furnishes no reason for the\npride of Romish priests; for Christ has commanded the ordination of\nministers to dispense his gospel and his mysteries, not the inauguration\nof priests to offer sacrifices. He has commissioned them to preach the\ngospel and to feed his flock, and not to immolate victims. He has\npromised them the grace of the Holy Spirit, not in order to effect an\nexpiation for sins, but rightly to sustain and conduct the government of\nthe Church.\nXXIX. There is an excellent correspondence between the ceremonies and\nthe thing itself. Our Lord, when he sent forth his disciples to preach\nthe gospel, “breathed upon them;”[1389] by that symbol representing the\npower of the Holy Spirit which he imparted to them. These sapient\ntheologues retain the _breathing_, and, as if they disgorged the Holy\nSpirit from their throats, they mutter over the priests whom they\nordain, _Receive ye the Holy Ghost_. Thus they leave nothing that they\ndo not preposterously counterfeit, I do not say like comedians, whose\ngesticulations are not without art and meaning, but like apes, who\nimitate every thing without any taste or design. We observe, they say,\nthe example of our Lord. But our Lord did many things which he never\nintended to be examples to us. He said to his disciples, “Receive ye the\nHoly Ghost.” He said to Lazarus, “Lazarus, Come forth.”[1390] He said to\nthe paralytic, “Arise and walk.”[1391] Why do not they say the same to\nall deceased persons and paralytics? When he breathed upon his apostles,\nand filled them with the grace of the Holy Spirit, he exhibited a\nspecimen of his Divine power. If they attempt to do the same, they\nemulate God, and, as it were, challenge him to contend with them; but\nthey are very far from producing a similar effect, and the foolish\nmimicry is a mere mockery of Christ. They have the effrontery, indeed,\nto dare to assert, that they confer the Holy Ghost; but how far this is\ntrue is shown by experience, which proves, that those who are\nconsecrated priests, from being horses become asses, and are changed\nfrom fools to madmen. Nor do I contend with them on this account; I only\ncondemn the ceremony itself, which ought not to be made a precedent,\nsince it was used by Christ as a special sign of a particular miracle;\nso far is their pretence of imitating him from justifying their conduct.\nXXX. But from whom have they received the unction? Their answer is, that\nthey have received it from the sons of Aaron, from whom also their order\nderived its origin. Thus they always prefer defending themselves by\nimproper examples, to confessing that which they practise without just\nreason to be their own invention; but at the same time, they do not\nconsider that, in professing themselves successors of the sons of Aaron,\nthey do an injury to the priesthood of Christ; which was the only thing\nadumbrated and prefigured by all the ancient priesthoods. In him,\ntherefore, they were all accomplished and concluded; in him they ceased,\nas we have more than once already stated, and the Epistle to the Hebrews\ndeclares without the help of any comment. But, if they are so highly\ndelighted with the Mosaic ceremonies, why do they not take oxen, and\ncalves, and lambs, and offer them as sacrifices? They have, indeed, a\ngreat part of the ancient tabernacle, and of all the Jewish worship; but\ntheir religion is still deficient in that they do not sacrifice animal\nvictims. Who does not see that this custom of anointing is far more\npernicious than circumcision; especially when it is attended with\nsuperstition and a pharisaical opinion of the merit of the act? The Jews\nplaced a confidence of righteousness in circumcision; in unction these\nmen place spiritual graces. Therefore, while they desire to be imitators\nof the Levites, they become apostates from Christ, and renounce the\noffice of pastors.\nXXXI. This is their consecrated oil, which, it is pretended, impresses a\ncharacter never to be effaced; as though oil could not be cleansed away\nwith dust and salt, or, if it be more adhesive, with soap. But this\ncharacter, they say, is spiritual. What connection has oil with the\nsoul? Have they forgotten an observation, which they often quote to us\nfrom Augustine—That, if the word be separated from the water, it will be\nnothing but water, and that it is the word which makes it a sacrament?\nWhat word will they show in their unction? Will they produce the command\nwhich was given to Moses to anoint the sons of Aaron? But in that case\nthere was also a command given respecting the coat, the ephod, the\nmitre, the holy crown, with which Aaron was to be adorned; and\nrespecting the coats, girdles, and mitres, with which his sons were to\nbe invested. It was commanded to kill a bullock, to burn his fat, to cut\none ram asunder and burn it, to sanctify their ears and garments with\nthe blood of another ram; and numerous other observances, which I wonder\nhow it is that they have entirely omitted, and taken only the anointing\noil. But if they are fond of being sprinkled, why are they sprinkled\nwith oil rather than with blood? They attempt, indeed, a most ingenious\nthing; to frame one religion out of a number of fragments collected\ntogether from Christianity, Judaism, and Paganism. Their unction,\ntherefore, is quite fetid, for want of the salt, the word of God. There\nremains imposition of hands, which I confess to be a sacrament in true\nand legitimate ordinations, but I deny that it has any place in this\nfarce, in which they neither obey the command of Christ, nor regard the\nend to which the promise ought to lead us. If they wish the sign not to\nbe refused to them, they must apply it to the very object to which it\nwas dedicated.\nXXXII. Respecting the order of deacons, also, I should have no\ncontroversy with them, if that office were restored to its primitive\npurity, as it existed under the apostles, and in the purer times of the\nChurch. But what resemblance to it is to be found among those whom the\nRomanists pretend to be deacons? I speak not of the persons, lest they\nshould complain that it is unjust to estimate their doctrine by the\nfaults of individuals; but I contend that, taking their deacons exactly\nas their doctrine describes them to us, it is absurd to fetch any\ntestimony in their favour from the examples of those who were appointed\ndeacons by the apostolic Church. They say that it belongs to their\ndeacons to assist the priests, to minister in every thing that is done\nin the sacraments, as in baptism, in chrism, to pour the wine into the\nchalice, to place the bread in the patine; to lay and dispose the\noblations upon the altar, to prepare and cover the table of the Lord, to\nbear the cross, to read and chant the gospel and epistle to the people.\nIs there in all this a single word of the true duty of deacons? Now, let\nus hear how they are inaugurated. On the deacon who is ordained the\nbishop alone lays his hand; on his left shoulder he places a stole, to\nteach him that he has taken upon him the light yoke of the Lord, to\nsubject to the fear of God every thing belonging to the left side. He\ngives him the text of the gospel, that he may know himself to be a\nherald of it. And what have these things to do with deacons? It is no\nbetter than if any one pretended to ordain apostles, while he only\nappointed them to burn incense, to adorn the images, to trim the lamps,\nto sweep the Churches, to catch mice, and to drive out dogs. Who could\nsuffer such persons to be called apostles, and to be compared with the\napostles of Christ? Let them never again falsely represent those as\ndeacons, whom they merely appoint to act a part in their farcical\nexhibitions. The very name which they bear sufficiently declares the\nnature of their office. For they call them Levites, and wish to deduce\ntheir origin from the sons of Levi. This I have no objection to their\ndoing, provided they drop their pretensions to Christianity.\nXXXIII. Of what use is it to say any thing respecting sub-deacons? In\nancient times they actually had the care of the poor. The Romanists\nattribute to them I know not what nugatory functions; as to bring the\nchalice and patine, the flagon with water, and the towel to the altar,\nto pour out water for washing the hands of the priests, and similar\nservices. When they speak of the sub-deacons receiving and bringing\noblations, they mean those which they devour as consecrated to their\nuse. With this office the ceremony of their initiation perfectly\ncorresponds: they receive from the bishop the patine and chalice, from\nthe archdeacon the flagon with water, the manual, and similar trumpery.\nThey require us to confess the Holy Ghost to be contained in these\nfooleries. What pious person can bear to admit this? But to come to an\nend, we may draw the same conclusion respecting them as respecting the\nrest; nor is it necessary to repeat any more of what we have already\nstated. This will be sufficient for persons of modest and docile minds,\nto whom this book is addressed; that there is no sacrament of God, which\ndoes not exhibit a ceremony annexed to a promise, or rather which does\nnot present a promise in a ceremony. In this case not a syllable is to\nbe found of any certain promise; and, therefore, it is in vain to seek\nfor a ceremony to confirm the promise. And of all the ceremonies which\nthey use, not one appears to have been instituted by God; therefore\nthere can be no sacrament.\nMATRIMONY.\nXXXIV. The last of their sacraments is matrimony, which all confess to\nhave been instituted by God, but which no one, till the time of Gregory,\never discovered to have been enjoined as a sacrament. And what man, in\nhis sober senses, would ever have taken it into his head? It is alleged\nto be a good and holy ordinance of God; and so agriculture,\narchitecture, shoemaking, and many other things, are legitimate\nordinances of God, and yet they are not sacraments. For it is required\nin a sacrament, not only that it be a work of God, but that it be an\nexternal ceremony appointed by God for the confirmation of a promise.\nThat there is nothing of this kind in matrimony even children can judge.\nBut, they say, it is a sign of a sacred thing, that is, of the spiritual\nunion of Christ with the Church. If by the word _sign_, they mean a\nsymbol presented to us by God to support our faith, they are very far\nfrom the truth. If by a sign they merely understand that which is\nadduced as a similitude, I will show how acutely they reason. Paul says,\n“One star differeth from another star in glory: so also is the\nresurrection of the dead.”[1392] Here is one sacrament. Christ says,\n“The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed.” Here is\nanother. Again: “The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven.”[1393] Here\nis a third. Isaiah says, “Behold, the Lord shall feed his flock like a\nshepherd.”[1394] Here is a fourth. Again: “The Lord shall go forth as a\nmighty man.”[1395] Here is a fifth. And what end will there be? Upon\nthis principle, every thing will be a sacrament; as many parables and\nsimilitudes as there are in the Scripture, there will be so many\nsacraments. Even theft will be a sacrament; because it is written, “The\nday of the Lord cometh as a thief.”[1396] Who can bear the foolish\nbabblings of these sophists? I confess indeed, that, whenever we see a\nvine, it is very desirable to recall to remembrance the language of\nChrist: “I am the vine, ye are the branches, and my Father is the\nhusbandman.”[1397] Whenever we meet a shepherd with his flock, it is\ngood for us to remember another declaration of our Lord: “I am the good\nshepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.”[1398] But if\nany one should class such similitudes among the sacraments, it would\nargue a want of mental sanity.\nXXXV. They obtrude upon us the language of Paul, in which, they say, he\nexpressly calls matrimony a sacrament. “He that loveth his wife, loveth\nhimself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and\ncherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church; for we are members of his\nbody, of his flesh, and his bones; for this cause shall a man leave his\nfather and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall\nbe one flesh. This is a great mystery (or _sacrament_, as the word is\nrendered in the Vulgate;) but I speak concerning Christ and the\nChurch.”[1399] But to treat the Scriptures in this manner, is to\nconfound heaven and earth together. To show to husbands what peculiar\naffection they ought to bear to their wives, Paul proposes Christ to\nthem as an example. For as he has poured forth all the treasures of his\nkindness upon the Church, which he had espoused to himself, so the\napostle would have every man to evince a similar affection towards his\nwife. It follows, “He that loveth his wife, loveth himself; even as the\nLord the Church.” Now, to declare how Christ has loved the Church, even\nas himself, and how he has made himself one with the Church his spouse,\nPaul applies to him what Moses relates Adam to have spoken of himself.\nFor when Eve was brought into his presence, knowing her to have been\nformed out of his side, he said, “This is bone of my bones, and flesh of\nmy flesh.”[1400] Paul testifies that all this has been spiritually\nfulfilled in Christ and us, when he says, “We are members of his body,\nof his flesh, and of his bones,” and consequently “one flesh” with him.\nAt length he concludes with an exclamation, “This is a great mystery;”\nand, that no one might be deceived by an ambiguity of language, he\nexpressly states, that he intends not the conjugal union of man and\nwoman, but the spiritual marriage of Christ and his Church: “I speak\nconcerning Christ and the Church.” And, indeed, it is a great mystery\nthat Christ has suffered a rib to be taken from him, of which we might\nbe formed: that is to say, though he was strong, he voluntarily became\nweak, that we might be strengthened with his might; so that now we\n“live, yet not” we, “but Christ liveth in” us.[1401]\nXXXVI. They have been deceived by the word _sacrament_ in the Vulgate\nversion. But was it reasonable that the whole Church should suffer the\npunishment of their ignorance? Paul has used the word μυστηριον,\n_mystery_—a word which the translator might have retained, _mysterium_\nbeing not unfamiliar to Latin ears, or he might have rendered it\n_arcanum_, secret; he preferred, however, to use the word _sacramentum_,\nsacrament, but in the same sense in which Paul has used the Greek word\nμυστηριον, _mystery_. Now, let them go and clamorously rail against the\ncritical knowledge of languages, through ignorance of which they have so\nlong been most shamefully deceived in a thing so easy and obvious to\nevery one. But why do they so strenuously insist on the word _sacrament_\nin this one passage, and pass it over in so many others without the\nleast notice? For that translator has used it twice in the First Epistle\nto Timothy,[1402] and in another place in this Epistle to the\nEphesians,[1403] and in every other case where the word _mystery_\noccurs. Let this oversight, however, be forgiven them; liars ought, at\nleast, to have good memories. For, after having dignified matrimony with\nthe title of a sacrament, what brainless versatility is it for them to\nstigmatize it with the characters of impurity, pollution, and carnal\ndefilement! What an absurdity is it to exclude priests from a sacrament!\nIf they deny that they are interdicted from the sacrament, but only from\nthe conjugal intercourse, I shall not be satisfied with this evasion.\nFor they inculcate that the conjugal intercourse itself is part of the\nsacrament, and that it represents the union which we have with Christ in\nconformity of nature; because it is by that intercourse that a husband\nand wife become one flesh. Here some of them have found two sacraments;\none, of God and the soul, in the man and woman when betrothed; the\nother, of Christ and the Church, in the husband and wife. The conjugal\nintercourse, upon their principles, however, is a sacrament, from which\nno Christian ought to be prohibited; unless the sacraments of Christians\nare so incompatible, that they cannot consist together. There is also\nanother absurdity in their doctrine. They affirm that the grace of the\nHoly Spirit is conferred in every sacrament; they acknowledge that the\nconjugal intercourse is a sacrament; yet they deny that the Holy Spirit\nis ever present in that intercourse.\nXXXVII. And, not to deceive the Church in one thing only, what a long\nseries of errors, falsehoods, frauds, and iniquities, have they joined\nto that false principle! It may truly be affirmed that, when they made\nmatrimony into a sacrament, they only sought a den of all abominations.\nFor, when they had once established this notion, they assumed to\nthemselves the cognizance of matrimonial causes; for matrimony was a\nspiritual thing, and not to be meddled with before lay judges. Then they\nmade laws for the confirmation of their tyranny; and some of them\nmanifestly impious towards God, and others most unjust towards men. Such\nas, that marriages contracted between young persons subject to the\nauthority of parents, without the consent of their parents, remain valid\nand permanent; that no marriages be lawful between persons related, even\nto the seventh degree; and that, if any such be contracted, they be\ndissolved, (and the degrees themselves they state in opposition to the\nlaws of all nations, and to the institution of Moses, so that what they\ncall the fourth degree is, in reality, the seventh;) that it be unlawful\nfor a man, who has repudiated his wife for adultery, to marry another;\nthat spiritual relatives be not united in marriage; that no marriages be\ncelebrated from Septuagesima, or the third Sunday before Lent, to the\noctaves of Easter, or eight days after that festival; for three weeks\nbefore the nativity of John the Baptist, or Midsummer-day, instead of\nwhich three weeks they now substitute the Whitsun week, and the two\nweeks which precede it; or from Advent to the Epiphany; and innumerable\nother regulations, which it would be tedious to enumerate. We must now\nquit their corruptions, in which we have been detained longer than I\ncould wish: but I think I have gained some advantage by stripping these\nasses, in some measure, of the lion’s skin, and so far unmasking their\nprinciples, and exposing them to the world in their true colours.\nFootnote 1366:\n1 Tim. ii. 8.\nFootnote 1367:\nMatt. xxi. 25.\nFootnote 1368:\nActs viii. 14-17.\nFootnote 1369:\nJohn vii. 37, 38.\nFootnote 1370:\nJohn xx. 22.\nFootnote 1371:\nGal. iv. 9.

          "content": "ON CIVIL GOVERNMENT.\nHaving already stated that man is the subject of two kinds of\ngovernment, and having sufficiently discussed that which is situated in\nthe soul, or the inner man, and relates to eternal life,—we are, in this\nchapter, to say something of the other kind, which relates to civil\njustice, and the regulation of the external conduct. For, though the\nnature of this argument seems to have no connection with the spiritual\ndoctrine of faith which I have undertaken to discuss, the sequel will\nshow that I have sufficient reason for connecting them together, and,\nindeed, that necessity obliges me to it; especially since, on the one\nhand, infatuated and barbarous men madly endeavour to subvert this\nordinance established by God; and, on the other hand, the flatterers of\nprinces, extolling their power beyond all just bounds, hesitate not to\noppose it to the authority of God himself. Unless both these errors be\nresisted, the purity of the faith will be destroyed. Besides, it is of\nno small importance for us to know what benevolent provision God has\nmade for mankind in this instance, that we may be stimulated by a\ngreater degree of pious zeal to testify our gratitude. In the first\nplace, before we enter on the subject itself, it is necessary for us to\nrecur to the distinction which we have already established, lest we fall\ninto an error very common in the world, and injudiciously confound\ntogether these two things, the nature of which is altogether different.\nFor some men, when they hear that the gospel promises a liberty which\nacknowledges no king or magistrate among men, but submits to Christ\nalone, think they can enjoy no advantage of their liberty, while they\nsee any power exalted above them. They imagine, therefore, that nothing\nwill prosper, unless the whole world be modelled in a new form, without\nany tribunals, or laws, or magistrates, or any thing of a similar kind,\nwhich they consider injurious to their liberty. But he who knows how to\ndistinguish between the body and the soul, between this present\ntransitory life and the future eternal one, will find no difficulty in\nunderstanding, that the spiritual kingdom of Christ and civil government\nare things very different and remote from each other. Since it is a\nJewish folly, therefore, to seek and include the kingdom of Christ under\nthe elements of this world, let us, on the contrary, considering what\nthe Scripture clearly inculcates, that the benefit which is received\nfrom the grace of Christ is spiritual; let us, I say, remember to\nconfine within its proper limits all this liberty which is promised and\noffered to us in him. For why is it that the same apostle, who, in one\nplace, exhorts to “stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made\nus free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage,”[1404] in\nanother, enjoins servants to “care not for” their servile\ncondition;[1405] except that spiritual liberty may very well consist\nwith civil servitude? In this sense we are likewise to understand him in\nthese passages: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond\nnor free, there is neither male nor female.”[1406] Again: “There is\nneither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian,\nScythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all;”[1407] in which\nhe signifies, that it is of no importance, what is our condition among\nmen, or under the laws of what nation we live, as the kingdom of Christ\nconsists not in these things.\nII. Yet this distinction does not lead us to consider the whole system\nof civil government as a polluted thing, which has nothing to do with\nChristian men. Some fanatics, who are pleased with nothing but liberty,\nor rather licentiousness without any restraint, do indeed boast and\nvociferate, That since we are dead with Christ to the elements of this\nworld, and, being translated into the kingdom of God, sit among the\ncelestials, it is a degradation to us, and far beneath our dignity, to\nbe occupied with those secular and impure cares which relate to things\naltogether uninteresting to a Christian man. Of what use, they ask, are\nlaws without judgments and tribunals? But what have judgments to do with\na Christian man? And if it be unlawful to kill, of what use are laws and\njudgments to us? But as we have just suggested that this kind of\ngovernment is distinct from that spiritual and internal reign of Christ,\nso it ought to be known that they are in no respect at variance with\neach other. For that spiritual reign, even now upon earth, commences\nwithin us some preludes of the heavenly kingdom, and in this mortal and\ntransitory life affords us some prelibations of immortal and\nincorruptible blessedness; but this civil government is designed, as\nlong as we live in this world, to cherish and support the external\nworship of God, to preserve the pure doctrine of religion, to defend the\nconstitution of the Church, to regulate our lives in a manner requisite\nfor the society of men, to form our manners to civil justice, to promote\nour concord with each other, and to establish general peace and\ntranquillity; all which I confess to be superfluous, if the kingdom of\nGod, as it now exists in us, extinguishes the present life. But if it is\nthe will of God, that while we are aspiring towards our true country, we\nbe pilgrims on the earth, and if such aids are necessary to our\npilgrimage, they who take them from man deprive him of his human nature.\nThey plead that there should be so much perfection in the Church of God,\nthat its order would suffice to supply the place of all laws; but they\nfoolishly imagine a perfection which can never be found in any community\nof men. For since the insolence of the wicked is so great, and their\niniquity so obstinate that it can scarcely be restrained by all the\nseverity of the laws, what may we expect they would do, if they found\nthemselves at liberty to perpetrate crimes with impunity, whose outrages\neven the arm of power cannot altogether prevent?\nIII. But for speaking of the exercise of civil polity, there will be\nanother place more suitable. At present we only wish it to be\nunderstood, that to entertain a thought of its extermination, is inhuman\nbarbarism; it is equally as necessary to mankind as bread and water,\nlight and air, and far more excellent. For it not only tends to secure\nthe accommodations arising from all these things, that men may breathe,\neat, drink, and be sustained in life, though it comprehends all these\nthings while it causes them to live together, yet, I say, this is not\nits only tendency; its objects also are, that idolatry, sacrileges\nagainst the name of God, blasphemies against his truth, and other\noffences against religion, may not openly appear and be disseminated\namong the people; that the public tranquillity may not be disturbed;\nthat every person may enjoy his property without molestation; that men\nmay transact their business together without fraud or injustice; that\nintegrity and modesty may be cultivated among them; in short, that there\nmay be a public form of religion among Christians, and that humanity may\nbe maintained among men. Nor let any one think it strange that I now\nrefer to human polity the charge of the due maintenance of religion,\nwhich I may appear to have placed beyond the jurisdiction of men. For I\ndo not allow men to make laws respecting religion and the worship of God\nnow, any more than I did before; though I approve of civil government,\nwhich provides that the true religion which is contained in the law of\nGod, be not violated, and polluted by public blasphemies, with impunity.\nBut the perspicuity of order will assist the readers to attain a clearer\nunderstanding of what sentiments ought to be entertained respecting the\nwhole system of civil administration, if we enter on a discussion of\neach branch of it. These are three: The magistrate, who is the guardian\nand conservator of the laws: The laws, according to which he governs:\nThe people, who are governed by the laws, and obey the magistrate. Let\nus, therefore, examine, first, the function of a magistrate, whether it\nbe a legitimate calling and approved by God, the nature of the duty, and\nthe extent of the power; secondly, by what laws Christian government\nought to be regulated; and lastly, what advantage the people derive from\nthe laws, and what obedience they owe to the magistrate.\nIV. The Lord has not only testified that the function of magistrates has\nhis approbation and acceptance, but has eminently commended it to us, by\ndignifying it with the most honourable titles. We will mention a few of\nthem. When all who sustain the magistracy are called “gods,”[1408] it\nought not to be considered as an appellation of trivial importance; for\nit implies, that they have their command from God, that they are\ninvested with his authority, and are altogether his representatives, and\nact as his vicegerents. This is not an invention of mine, but the\ninterpretation of Christ, who says, “If he called them gods, unto whom\nthe word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken.”[1409] What is\nthe meaning of this, but that their commission has been given to them by\nGod, to serve him in their office, and, as Moses and Jehoshaphat said to\nthe judges whom they appointed, to “judge not for man, but for the\nLord?”[1410] To the same purpose is the declaration of the wisdom of God\nby the mouth of Solomon: “By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.\nBy me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.”[1411]\nThis is just as if it had been affirmed, that the authority possessed by\nkings and other governors over all things upon earth is not a\nconsequence of the perverseness of men, but of the providence and holy\nordinance of God, who has been pleased to regulate human affairs in this\nmanner; forasmuch as he is present, and also presides among them, in\nmaking laws and in executing equitable judgments. This is clearly taught\nby Paul, when he enumerates governments (ὁ προἱσταμενος)[1412] among the\ngifts of God, which, being variously distributed according to the\ndiversity of grace, ought to be employed by the servants of Christ to\nthe edification of the Church. For though in that place he is properly\nspeaking of the council of elders, who were appointed in the primitive\nChurch to preside over the regulation of the public discipline, the same\noffice which in writing to the Corinthians he calls κυβερνησεις,\n“governments,”[1413] yet, as we see that civil government tends to\npromote the same object, there is no doubt that he recommends to his\nevery kind of just authority. But he does this in a manner much more\nexplicit, where he enters on a full discussion of that subject. For he\nsays, “There is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of\nGod. Rulers are ministers of God, revengers to execute wrath upon him\nthat doeth evil. Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of\nthe same.”[1414] This is corroborated by the examples of holy men; of\nwhom some have been kings, as David, Josiah, Hezekiah; some have been\nviceroys, as Joseph and Daniel; some have held civil offices in a\ncommonwealth, as Moses, Joshua, and the Judges; whose functions God\ndeclared to be approved by him. Wherefore no doubt ought now to be\nentertained by any person that civil magistracy is a calling not only\nholy and legitimate, but far the most sacred and honourable in human\nlife.\nV. Those who would wish to introduce anarchy, reply, that though, in\nancient times, kings and judges presided over a rude people, that\nservile kind of government is now quite incompatible with the perfection\nwhich accompanies the gospel of Christ. Here they betray not only their\nignorance, but their diabolical pride, in boasting of perfection, of\nwhich not the smallest particle can be discovered in them. But whatever\ntheir characters may be, they are easily refuted. For, when David\nexhorts kings and judges to kiss the Son of God,[1415] he does not\ncommand them to abdicate their authority and retire to private life, but\nto submit to Christ the power with which they are invested, that he\nalone may have the preëminence over all. In like manner Isaiah, when he\npredicts that “kings shall be nursing-fathers and queens\nnursing-mothers” to the Church,[1416] does not depose them from their\nthrones; but rather establishes them by an honourable title, as patrons\nand protectors of the pious worshippers of God; for that prophecy\nrelates to the advent of Christ. I purposely omit numerous testimonies,\nwhich often occur, and especially in the Psalms, in which the rights of\nall governors are asserted. But the most remarkable of all is that\npassage where Paul, admonishing Timothy that in the public congregation,\n“supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made\nfor kings and for all that are in authority,” assigns as a reason, “that\nwe may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and\nhonesty;”[1417] language in which he recommends the state of the Church\nto their patronage and defence.\nVI. This consideration ought continually to occupy the magistrates\nthemselves, since it is calculated to furnish them with a powerful\nstimulus, by which they may be excited to their duty, and to afford them\npeculiar consolation, by which the difficulties of their office, which\ncertainly are many and arduous, may be alleviated. For what an ardent\npursuit of integrity, prudence, clemency, moderation, and innocence\nought they to prescribe to themselves, who are conscious of having been\nconstituted ministers of the Divine justice! With what confidence will\nthey admit iniquity to their tribunal, which they understand to be the\nthrone of the living God? With what audacity will they pronounce an\nunjust sentence with that mouth which they know to be the destined organ\nof Divine truth? With what conscience will they subscribe to impious\ndecrees with that hand which they know to be appointed to register the\nedicts of God? In short, if they remember that they are the vicegerents\nof God, it behoves them to watch with all care, earnestness, and\ndiligence, that in their administration they may exhibit to men an\nimage, as it were, of the providence, care, goodness, benevolence, and\njustice of God. And they must constantly bear this in mind, that if in\nall cases “he be cursed that doeth the work of the Lord\ndeceitfully,”[1418] a far heavier curse awaits those who act\nfraudulently in a righteous calling. Therefore, when Moses and\nJehoshaphat wished to exhort their judges to the discharge of their\nduty, they had nothing to suggest more efficacious than the principle\nwhich we have already mentioned. Moses says, “Judge righteously between\nevery man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. For the\njudgment is God’s.”[1419] Jehoshaphat says, “Take heed what ye do; for\nye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment.\nWherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you: take heed and do it;\nfor there is no iniquity with the Lord our God.”[1420] And in another\nplace it is said, “God standeth in the congregation of the mighty: he\njudgeth among the gods;”[1421] that they may be animated to their duty,\nwhen they understand that they are delegated by God, to whom they must\none day render an account of their administration. And this admonition\nis entitled to have considerable weight with them; for if they fail in\ntheir duty, they not only injure men by criminally distressing them, but\neven offend God by polluting his sacred judgments. On the other hand, it\nopens a source of peculiar consolation to them to reflect, that they are\nnot employed in profane things, or occupations unsuitable to a servant\nof God, but in a most sacred function, inasmuch as they execute a Divine\ncommission.\nVII. Those who are not restrained by so many testimonies of Scripture,\nbut still dare to stigmatize this sacred ministry as a thing\nincompatible with religion and Christian piety, do they not offer an\ninsult to God himself, who cannot but be involved in the reproach cast\nupon his ministry? And in fact they do not reject magistrates, but they\nreject God, “that he should not reign over them.”[1422] For if this was\ntruly asserted by the Lord respecting the people of Israel, because they\nrefused the government of Samuel, why shall it not now be affirmed with\nequal truth of those who take the liberty to outrage all the authorities\nwhich God has instituted? But they object that our Lord said to his\ndisciples, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them: but\nye shall not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the\nyounger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve:”[1423] and they\ncontend that these words prohibit the exercise of royalty, or any other\nauthority, by any Christians. Admirable expositors! A contention had\narisen among the disciples “which of them should be accounted the\ngreatest.” To repress this vain ambition, our Lord taught them that\ntheir ministry was not like temporal kingdoms, in which one person has\nthe preëminence over all others. Now, what dishonour does this\ncomparison cast upon regal dignity? What does it prove at all, except\nthat the regal office is not the apostolic ministry? Moreover, though\nthere are various forms of magistracy, yet there is no difference in\nthis respect, but we ought to receive them all as ordinances of God. For\nPaul comprehends them all together, when he says, that “there is no\npower but of God;” and that which was furthest from giving general\nsatisfaction, is recommended to us in a remarkable manner beyond all\nothers; namely, the government of one man; which, as it is attended with\nthe common servitude of all, except the single individual to whose will\nall others are subjected, has never been so highly approved by heroic\nand noble minds. But the Scripture, on the contrary, to correct these\nunjust sentiments, expressly affirms, that it is by the providence of\nDivine wisdom that kings reign, and particularly commands us to “honour\nthe king.”[1424]\nVIII. And for private men, who have no authority to deliberate on the\nregulation of any public affairs, it would surely be a vain occupation\nto dispute which would be the best form of government in the place where\nthey live. Besides, this could not be simply determined, as an abstract\nquestion, without great impropriety, since the principle to guide the\ndecision must depend on circumstances. And even if we compare the\ndifferent forms together, without their circumstances, their advantages\nare so nearly equal, that it will not be easy to discover of which the\nutility preponderates. The forms of civil government are considered to\nbe of three kinds: Monarchy, which is the dominion of one person,\nwhether called a king, or a duke, or any other title; Aristocracy, or\nthe dominion of the principal persons of a nation; and Democracy, or\npopular government, in which the power resides in the people at large.\nIt is true that the transition is easy from monarchy to despotism; it is\nnot much more difficult from aristocracy to oligarchy, or the faction of\na few; but it is most easy of all from democracy to sedition. Indeed, if\nthese three forms of government, which are stated by philosophers, be\nconsidered in themselves, I shall by no means deny, that either\naristocracy, or a mixture of aristocracy and democracy, far excels all\nothers; and that indeed not of itself, but because it very rarely\nhappens that kings regulate themselves so that their will is never at\nvariance with justice and rectitude; or, in the next place, that they\nare endued with such penetration and prudence, as in all cases to\ndiscover what is best. The vice or imperfection of men therefore renders\nit safer and more tolerable for the government to be in the hands of\nmany, that they may afford each other mutual assistance and admonition,\nand that if any one arrogate to himself more than is right, the many may\nact as censors and masters to restrain his ambition. This has always\nbeen proved by experience, and the Lord confirmed it by his authority,\nwhen he established a government of this kind among the people of\nIsrael, with a view to preserve them in the most desirable condition,\ntill he exhibited in David a type of Christ. And as I readily\nacknowledge that no kind of government is more happy than this, where\nliberty is regulated with becoming moderation, and properly established\non a durable basis, so also I consider those as the most happy people,\nwho are permitted to enjoy such a condition; and if they exert their\nstrenuous and constant efforts for its preservation and retention, I\nadmit that they act in perfect consistence with their duty. And to this\nobject the magistrates likewise ought to apply their greatest diligence,\nthat they suffer not the liberty, of which they are constituted\nguardians, to be in any respect diminished, much less to be violated: if\nthey are inactive and unconcerned about this, they are perfidious to\ntheir office, and traitors to their country. But if those, to whom the\nwill of God has assigned another form of government, transfer this to\nthemselves so as to be tempted to desire a revolution, the very thought\nwill be not only foolish and useless, but altogether criminal. If we\nlimit not our views to one city, but look round and take a comprehensive\nsurvey of the whole world, or at least extend our observations to\ndistant lands, we shall certainly find it to be a wise arrangement of\nDivine Providence that various countries are governed by different forms\nof civil polity; for they are admirably held together with a certain\ninequality, as the elements are combined in very unequal proportions.\nAll these remarks, however, will be unnecessary to those who are\nsatisfied with the will of the Lord. For if it be his pleasure to\nappoint kings over kingdoms, and senators or other magistrates over free\ncities, it is our duty to be obedient to any governors whom God has\nestablished over the places in which we reside.\nIX. Here it is necessary to state in a brief manner the nature of the\noffice of magistracy, as described in the word of God, and wherein it\nconsists. If the Scripture did not teach that this office extends to\nboth tables of the law, we might learn it from heathen writers; for not\none of them has treated of the office of magistrates, of legislation,\nand civil government, without beginning with religion and Divine\nworship. And thus they have all confessed that no government can be\nhappily constituted, unless its first object, be the promotion of piety,\nand that all laws are preposterous which neglect the claims of God, and\nmerely provide for the interests of men. Therefore, as religion holds\nthe first place among all the philosophers, and as this has always been\nregarded by the universal consent of all nations, Christian princes and\nmagistrates ought to be ashamed of their indolence, if they do not make\nit the object of their most serious care. We have already shown that\nthis duty is particularly enjoined upon them by God; for it is\nreasonable that they should employ their utmost efforts in asserting and\ndefending the honour of him, whose vicegerents they are, and by whose\nfavour they govern. And the principal commendations given in the\nScripture to the good kings are for having restored the worship of God\nwhen it had been corrupted or abolished, or for having devoted their\nattention to religion, that it might flourish in purity and safety under\ntheir reigns. On the contrary, the sacred history represents it as one\nof the evils arising from anarchy, or a want of good government, that\nwhen “there was no king in Israel, every man did that which was right in\nhis own eyes.”[1425] These things evince the folly of those who would\nwish magistrates to neglect all thoughts of God, and to confine\nthemselves entirely to the administration of justice among men; as\nthough God appointed governors in his name to decide secular\ncontroversies, and disregarded that which is of far greater\nimportance—the pure worship of himself according to the rule of his law.\nBut a rage for universal innovation, and a desire to escape with\nimpunity, instigate men of turbulent spirits to wish that all the\navengers of violated piety were removed out of the world. With respect\nto the second table, Jeremiah admonishes kings in the following manner:\n“Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of\nthe hand of the oppressor; and do no wrong, do no violence to the\nstranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent\nblood.”[1426] To the same purpose is the exhortation in the\neighty-second psalm: “Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the\nafflicted and needy: deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the\nhand of the wicked.”[1427] And Moses “charged the judges” whom he\nappointed to supply his place, saying, “Hear the causes between your\nbrethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and\nthe stranger that is with him: ye shall not respect persons in judgment;\nbut ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid\nof the face of man; for the judgment is God’s.”[1428] I forbear to\nremark the directions given by him in another place respecting their\nfuture kings: “He shall not multiply horses to himself; neither shall he\ngreatly multiply to himself silver and gold; his heart shall not be\nlifted up above his brethren; he shall read in the law all the days of\nhis life;”[1429] also that judges show no partiality, nor take bribes,\nwith similar injunctions, which abound in the Scriptures; because, in\ndescribing the office of magistrates in this treatise, my design is not\nso much to instruct magistrates themselves, as to show to others what\nmagistrates are, and for what end God has appointed them. We see,\ntherefore, that they are constituted the protectors and vindicators of\nthe public innocence, modesty, probity, and tranquillity, whose sole\nobject it ought to be to promote the common peace and security of all.\nOf these virtues, David declares that he will be an example, when he\nshall be exalted to the royal throne. “I will set no wicked thing before\nmine eyes. I will not know a wicked person. Whoso privily slandereth his\nneighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath a high look and a proud\nheart will I not suffer. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the\nland, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he\nshall serve me.”[1430] But as they cannot do this, unless they defend\ngood men from the injuries of the wicked, and aid the oppressed by their\nrelief and protection, they are likewise armed with power for the\nsuppression of crimes, and the severe punishment of malefactors, whose\nwickedness disturbs the public peace. For experience fully verifies the\nobservation of Solon: “That all states are supported by reward and\npunishment; and that when these two things are removed, all the\ndiscipline of human societies is broken and destroyed.” For the minds of\nmany lose their regard for equity and justice, unless virtue be rewarded\nwith due honour; nor can the violence of the wicked be restrained,\nunless crimes are followed by severe punishments. And these two parts\nare included in the injunction of the prophet to kings and other\ngovernors, to “execute judgment and righteousness.”[1431]\n_Righteousness_ means the care, patronage, defence, vindication, and\nliberation of the innocent: _judgment_ imports the repression of the\naudacity, the coercion of the violence, and the punishment of the\ncrimes, of the impious.\nX. But here, it seems, arises an important and difficult question. If by\nthe law of God all Christians are forbidden to kill,[1432] and the\nprophet predicts respecting the Church, that “they shall not hurt nor\ndestroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord,”[1433] how can it be\ncompatible with piety for magistrates to shed blood? But if we\nunderstand, that in the infliction of punishments, the magistrate does\nnot act at all from himself, but merely executes the judgments of God,\nwe shall not be embarrassed with this scruple. The law of the Lord\ncommands, “Thou shalt not kill;” but that homicide may not go\nunpunished, the legislator himself puts the sword into the hands of his\nministers, to be used against all homicides.[1434] _To hurt_ and _to\ndestroy_ are incompatible with the character of the godly; but to avenge\nthe afflictions of the righteous at the command of God, is neither _to\nhurt_ nor _to destroy_. Therefore it is easy to conclude that in this\nrespect magistrates are not subject to the common law; by which, though\nthe Lord binds the hands of men, he does not bind his own justice, which\nhe exercises by the hands of magistrates. So, when a prince forbids all\nhis subjects to strike or wound any one, he does not prohibit his\nofficers from executing that justice which is particularly committed to\nthem. I sincerely wish that this consideration were constantly in our\nrecollection, that nothing is done here by the temerity of men, but\nevery thing by the authority of God, who commands it, and under whose\nguidance we never err from the right way. For we can find no valid\nobjection to the infliction of public vengeance, unless the justice of\nGod be restrained from the punishment of crimes. But if it be unlawful\nfor us to impose restraints upon him, why do we calumniate his\nministers? Paul says of the magistrate, that “He beareth not the sword\nin vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon\nhim that doeth evil.”[1435] Therefore, if princes and other governors\nknow that nothing will be more acceptable to God than their obedience,\nand if they desire to approve their piety, justice, and integrity before\nGod, let them devote themselves to this duty. This motive influenced\nMoses, when, knowing himself to be destined to become the liberator of\nhis people by the power of the Lord, “he slew the Egyptian;”[1436] and\nwhen he punished the idolatry of the people by the slaughter of three\nthousand men in one day.[1437] The same motive actuated David, when, at\nthe close of his life, he commanded his son Solomon to put to death Joab\nand Shimei.[1438] Hence, also, it is enumerated among the virtues of a\nking, to “destroy all the wicked of the land, that he may cut off all\nwicked doers from the city of the Lord.”[1439] The same topic furnishes\nthe eulogium given to Solomon: “Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest\nwickedness.”[1440] How did the meek and placid disposition of Moses burn\nwith such cruelty, that, after having his hands imbrued in the blood of\nhis brethren, he continued to go through the camp till three thousand\nwere slain? How did David, who discovered such humanity all his\nlifetime, in his last moments bequeath such a cruel injunction to his\nson respecting Joab? “Let not his hoar head go down to the grave in\npeace;” and respecting Shimei: “His hoar head bring down to the grave\nwith blood.” Both Moses and David, in executing the vengeance committed\nto them by God, by this severity sanctified their hands, which would\nhave been defiled by lenity. Solomon says, “It is an abomination to\nkings to commit wickedness; for the throne is established by\nrighteousness.”[1441] Again: “A king that sitteth in the throne of\njudgment, scattereth away all evil with his eyes.”[1442] Again: “A wise\nking scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.”[1443]\nAgain: “Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth\na vessel for the finer. Take away the wicked from before the king, and\nhis throne shall be established in righteousness.”[1444] Again: “He that\njustifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both\nare an abomination to the Lord.”[1445] Again: “An evil man seeketh only\nrebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.”[1446]\nAgain: “He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the\npeople curse, nations shall abhor him.”[1447] Now, if it be true justice\nfor them to pursue the wicked with a drawn sword, let them sheathe the\nsword, and keep their hands from shedding blood, while the swords of\ndesperadoes are drenched in murders; and they will be so far from\nacquiring the praise of goodness and justice by this forbearance, that\nthey will involve themselves in the deepest impiety. There ought not,\nhowever, to be any excessive or unreasonable severity, nor ought any\ncause to be given for considering the tribunal as a gibbet prepared for\nall who are accused. For I am not an advocate for unnecessary cruelty,\nnor can I conceive the possibility of an equitable sentence being\npronounced without mercy; of which Solomon affirms, that “mercy and\ntruth preserve the king; and his throne is upholden by mercy.”[1448] Yet\nit behoves the magistrate to be on his guard against both these errors;\nthat he do not, by excessive severity, wound rather than heal; or,\nthrough a superstitious affectation of clemency, fall into a mistaken\nhumanity, which is the worst kind of cruelty, by indulging a weak and\nill-judged lenity, to the detriment of multitudes. For it is a remark\nnot without foundation, that was anciently applied to the government of\nNerva, that it is bad to live under a prince who permits nothing, but\nmuch worse to live under one who permits every thing.\nXI. Now, as it is sometimes necessary for kings and nations to take up\narms for the infliction of such public vengeance, the same reason will\nlead us to infer the lawfulness of wars which are undertaken for this\nend. For if they have been intrusted with power to preserve the\ntranquillity of their own territories, to suppress the seditious tumults\nof disturbers, to succour the victims of oppression, and to punish\ncrimes,—can they exert this power for a better purpose, than to repel\nthe violence of him who disturbs both the private repose of individuals\nand the general tranquillity of the nation; who excites insurrections,\nand perpetrates acts of oppression, cruelty, and every species of crime?\nIf they ought to be the guardians and defenders of the laws, it is\nincumbent upon them to defeat the efforts of all by whose injustice the\ndiscipline of the laws is corrupted. And if they justly punish those\nrobbers, whose injuries have only extended to a few persons, shall they\nsuffer a whole district to be plundered and devastated with impunity?\nFor there is no difference, whether he, who in a hostile manner invades,\ndisturbs, and plunders the territory of another to which he has no\nright, be a king, or one of the meanest of mankind: all persons of this\ndescription are equally to be considered as robbers, and ought to be\npunished as such. It is the dictate both of natural equity, and of the\nnature of the office, therefore, that princes are armed, not only to\nrestrain the crimes of private individuals by judicial punishments, but\nalso to defend the territories committed to their charge by going to war\nagainst any hostile aggression; and the Holy Spirit, in many passages of\nScripture, declares such wars to be lawful.\nXII. If it be objected that the New Testament contains no precept or\nexample, which proves war to be lawful to Christians, I answer, first,\nthat the reason for waging war which existed in ancient times, is\nequally valid in the present age; and that, on the contrary, there is no\ncause to prevent princes from defending their subjects. Secondly, that\nno express declaration on this subject is to be expected in the writings\nof the apostles, whose design was, not to organize civil governments,\nbut to describe the spiritual kingdom of Christ. Lastly, that in those\nvery writings it is implied by the way, that no change has been made in\nthis respect by the coming of Christ. “For,” to use the words of\nAugustine, “if Christian discipline condemned all wars, the soldiers who\ninquired respecting their salvation ought rather to have been directed\nto cast away their arms, and entirely to renounce the military\nprofession; whereas the advice given them was, ‘Do violence to no man,\nneither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.’[1449] An\ninjunction to be content with their wages was certainly not a\nprohibition of the military life.” But here all magistrates ought to be\nvery cautious, that they follow not in any respect the impulse of their\npassions. On the contrary, if punishments are to be inflicted, they\nought not to be precipitated with anger, exasperated with hatred, or\ninflamed with implacable severity: they ought, as Augustine says, “to\ncommiserate our common nature even in him whom they punish for his\ncrime.” Or, if arms are to be resorted to against an enemy, that is, an\narmed robber, they ought not to seize a trivial occasion, nor even to\ntake it when presented, unless they are driven to it by extreme\nnecessity. For, if it be our duty to exceed what was required by that\nheathen writer who maintained that the evident object of war ought to be\nthe restoration of peace, certainly we ought to make every other attempt\nbefore we have recourse to the decision of arms. In short, in both cases\nthey must not suffer themselves to be carried away by any private\nmotive, but be wholly guided by public spirit; otherwise they grossly\nabuse their power, which is given them, not for their own particular\nadvantage, but for the benefit and service of others. Moreover, on this\nright of war depends the lawfulness of garrisons, alliances, and other\ncivil munitions. By _garrisons_, I mean soldiers who are stationed in\ntowns to defend the boundaries of a country. By _alliances_, I mean\nconfederations which are made between neighbouring princes, that, if any\ndisturbance arise in their territories, they will render each other\nmutual assistance, and will unite their forces together for the common\nresistance of the common enemies of mankind. By _civil munitions_, I\nmean all the provisions which are employed in the art of war.\nXIII. In the last place, I think it necessary to add, that tributes and\ntaxes are the legitimate revenues of princes; which, indeed, they ought\nprincipally to employ in sustaining the public expenses of their office,\nbut which they may likewise use for the support of their domestic\nsplendour, which is closely connected with the dignity of the government\nthat they hold. Thus we see that David, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah,\nand other pious kings, and likewise Joseph and Daniel, without any\nviolation of piety, on account of the office which they filled, lived at\nthe public expense; and we read in Ezekiel of a very ample portion of\nland being assigned to the kings;[1450] in which passage, though the\nprophet is describing the spiritual kingdom of Christ, yet he borrows\nthe model of it from the legitimate kingdoms of men. On the other hand,\nprinces themselves ought to remember, that their finances are not so\nmuch private incomes, as the revenues of the whole people, according to\nthe testimony of Paul,[1451] and therefore cannot be lavished or\ndilapidated without manifest injustice; or, rather, that they are to be\nconsidered as the blood of the people, not to spare which is the most\ninhuman cruelty; and their various imposts and tributes ought to be\nregarded merely as aids of the public necessity, to burden the people\nwith which, without cause, would be tyrannical rapacity. These things\ngive no encouragement to princes to indulge profusion and luxury; and\ncertainly there is no need to add fuel to their passions, which of\nthemselves are more than sufficiently inflamed; but, as it is of very\ngreat importance, that whatever they undertake they attempt it with a\npure conscience before God, it is necessary, in order to their avoiding\nvain confidence and contempt of God, that they be taught how far their\nrights extend. Nor is this doctrine useless to private persons, who\nlearn from it not to pronounce rash and insolent censures on the\nexpenses of princes, notwithstanding they exceed the limits of common\nlife.\nXIV. From the magistracy, we next proceed to the laws, which are the\nstrong nerves of civil polity, or, according to an appellation which\nCicero has borrowed from Plato, the _souls of states_, without which\nmagistracy cannot subsist, as, on the other hand, without magistrates\nlaws are of no force. No observation, therefore, can be more correct\nthan this, that the law is a silent magistrate, and a magistrate a\nspeaking law. Though I have promised to show by what laws a Christian\nstate ought to be regulated, it will not be reasonable for any person to\nexpect a long discussion respecting the best kind of laws; which is a\nsubject of immense extent, and foreign from our present object. I will\nbriefly remark, however, by the way, what laws it may piously use before\nGod, and be rightly governed by among men. And even this I would have\npreferred passing over in silence, if I did not know that it is a point\non which many persons run into dangerous errors. For some deny that a\nstate is well constituted, which neglects the polity of Moses, and is\ngoverned by the common laws of nations. The dangerous and seditious\nnature of this opinion I leave to the examination of others; it will be\nsufficient for me to have evinced it to be false and foolish. Now, it is\nnecessary to observe that common distinction, which distributes all the\nlaws of God promulgated by Moses into moral, ceremonial, and judicial;\nand these different kinds of laws are to be distinctly examined, that we\nmay ascertain what belongs to us, and what does not. Nor let any one be\nembarrassed by this scruple, that even the ceremonial and judicial\nprecepts are included in the moral. For the ancients, who first made\nthis distinction, were not ignorant that these two kinds of precepts\nrelated to the conduct of moral agents; yet, as they might be changed\nand abrogated without affecting the morality of actions, therefore they\ndid not call them moral precepts. They particularly applied this\nappellation to those precepts without which there can be no real purity\nof morals, nor any permanent rule of a holy life.\nXV. The moral law, therefore, with which I shall begin, being comprised\nin two leading articles, of which one simply commands us to worship God\nwith pure faith and piety, and the other enjoins us to embrace men with\nsincere love,—this law, I say, is the true and eternal rule of\nrighteousness, prescribed to men of all ages and nations, who wish to\nconform their lives to the will of God. For this is his eternal and\nimmutable will, that he himself be worshipped by us all, and that we\nmutually love one another. The ceremonial law was the pupilage of the\nJews, with which it pleased the Lord to exercise that people during a\nstate resembling childhood, till that “fulness of the time” should\ncome,[1452] when he would fully manifest his wisdom to the world, and\nwould exhibit the reality of those things which were then adumbrated in\nfigures. The judicial law, given to them as a political constitution,\ntaught them certain rules of equity and justice, by which they might\nconduct themselves in a harmless and peaceable manner towards each\nother. And as that exercise of ceremonies properly related to the\ndoctrine of piety, inasmuch as it kept the Jewish Church in the worship\nand service of God, which is the first article of the moral law, and yet\nwas distinct from piety itself, so these judicial regulations, though\nthey had no other end than the preservation of that love, which is\nenjoined in the eternal law of God, yet had something which\ndistinguished them from that precept itself. As the ceremonies,\ntherefore, might be abrogated without any violation or injury of piety,\nso the precepts and duties of love remain of perpetual obligation,\nnotwithstanding the abolition of all these judicial ordinances. If this\nbe true, certainly all nations are left at liberty to enact such laws as\nthey shall find to be respectively expedient for them; provided they be\nframed according to that perpetual rule of love, so that, though they\nvary in form, they may have the same end. For those barbarous and savage\nlaws which rewarded theft and permitted promiscuous concubinage, with\nothers still more vile, execrable, and absurd, I am very far from\nthinking ought to be considered as laws; since they are not only\nviolations of all righteousness, but outrages against humanity itself.\nXVI. What I have said will be more clearly understood, if in all laws we\nproperly consider these two things—the constitution of the law and its\nequity, on the reason of which the constitution itself is founded and\nrests. Equity, being natural, is the same to all mankind; and\nconsequently all laws, on every subject, ought to have the same equity\nfor their end. Particular enactments and regulations, being connected\nwith circumstances, and partly dependent upon them, may be different in\ndifferent cases without any impropriety, provided they are all equally\ndirected to the same object of equity. Now, as it is certain that the\nlaw of God, which we call the moral law, is no other than a declaration\nof natural law, and of that conscience which has been engraven by God on\nthe minds of men, the whole rule of this equity, of which we now speak,\nis prescribed in it. This equity, therefore, must alone be the scope,\nand rule, and end, of all laws. Whatever laws shall be framed according\nto that rule, directed to that object, and limited to that end, there is\nno reason why we should censure them, however they may differ from the\nJewish law or from each other. The law of God forbids theft. What\npunishment was enacted for thieves, among the Jews, may be seen in the\nbook of Exodus.[1453] The most ancient laws of other nations punished\ntheft by requiring a compensation of double the value. Subsequent laws\nmade a distinction between open and secret theft. Some proceeded to\nbanishment, some to flagellation, and some to the punishment of death.\nFalse witness was punished, among the Jews, with the same punishment as\nsuch testimony would have caused to be inflicted on the person against\nwhom it was given;[1454] in some countries it was punished with infamy,\nin others with hanging, in others with crucifixion. All laws agree in\npunishing murder with death, though in several different forms. The\npunishments of adulterers in different countries have been attended with\ndifferent degrees of severity. Yet we see how, amidst this diversity,\nthey are all directed to the same end. For they all agree in denouncing\npunishment against those crimes which are condemned by the eternal law\nof God; such as murders, thefts, adulteries, false testimonies, though\nthere is not a uniformity in the mode of punishment; and, indeed, this\nis neither necessary, nor even expedient. One country, if it did not\ninflict the most exemplary vengeance upon murderers, would soon be\nruined by murders and robberies. One age requires the severity of\npunishments to be increased. If a country be disturbed by any civil\ncommotion, the evils which generally arise from it must be corrected by\nnew edicts. In time of war all humanity would be forgotten amidst the\ndin of arms, if men were not awed by more than a common dread of\npunishment. During famine and pestilence, unless greater severity be\nemployed, every thing will fall into ruin. One nation is more prone than\nothers to some particular vice, unless it be most rigidly restrained.\nWhat malignity and envy against the public good will be betrayed by him\nwho shall take offence at such diversity, which is best adapted to\nsecure the observance of the law of God? For the objection made by some,\nthat it is an insult to the law of God given by Moses, when it is\nabrogated, and other laws are preferred to it, is without any\nfoundation; for neither are other laws preferred to it, when they are\nmore approved, not on a simple comparison, but on account of the\ncircumstances of time, place, and nation; nor do we abrogate that which\nwas never given to us. For the Lord gave not that law by the hand of\nMoses to be promulgated among all nations, and to be universally\nbinding; but after having taken the Jewish nation into his special\ncharge, patronage, and protection, he was pleased to become, in a\npeculiar manner, their legislator, and, as became a wise legislator, in\nall the laws which he gave them, he had a special regard to their\npeculiar circumstances.\nXVII. It now remains for us, as we proposed, in the last place, to\nexamine what advantage the common society of Christians derives from\nlaws, judgments, and magistrates; with which is connected another\nquestion—what honour private persons ought to render to magistrates, and\nhow far their obedience ought to extend. Many persons suppose the office\nof magistracy to be of no use among Christians, for that they cannot,\nconsistently with piety, apply for their assistance, because they are\nforbidden to have recourse to revenge or litigation. But as Paul, on the\ncontrary, clearly testifies that the magistrate is “the minister of God\nto us for good,”[1455] we understand from this that he is divinely\nappointed, in order that we may be defended by his power and protection\nagainst the malice and injuries of wicked men, and may lead peaceable\nand secure lives. But if it be in vain that he is given to us by the\nLord for our protection, unless it be lawful for us to avail ourselves\nof such an advantage, it clearly follows that we may appeal to him, and\napply for his aid, without any violation of piety. But here I have to do\nwith two sorts of persons; for there are multitudes inflamed with such a\nrage for litigation, that they never have peace in themselves, unless\nthey are in contention with others; and they commence their lawsuits\nwith a mortal bitterness of animosities, and with an infuriated cupidity\nof revenge and injury, and pursue them with an implacable obstinacy,\neven to the ruin of their adversary. At the same time, that they may not\nbe thought to do any thing wrong, they defend this perverseness under\nthe pretext of seeking justice. But, though it is allowable for a man to\nendeavour to obtain justice from his neighbour by a judicial process, he\nis not therefore at liberty to hate him, or to cherish a desire to hurt\nhim, or to persecute him without mercy.\nXVIII. Let such persons, therefore, understand, that judicial processes\nare lawful to those who use them rightly; and that the right use, both\nfor the plaintiff and for the defendant, is this: First, if the\nplaintiff, being injured either in his person or in his property, has\nrecourse to the protection of the magistrate, states his complaint,\nmakes a just and equitable claim, but without any desire of injury or\nrevenge, without any asperity or hatred, without any ardour for\ncontention, but rather prepared to waive his right, and to sustain some\ndisadvantage, than to cherish enmity against his adversary. Secondly, if\nthe defendant, being summoned, appears on the day appointed, and defends\nhis cause by the best arguments in his power, without any bitterness,\nbut with the simple desire of maintaining his just right. On the\ncontrary, when their minds are filled with malevolence, corrupted with\nenvy, incensed with wrath, stimulated with revenge, or inflamed with the\nfervour of contention, so as to diminish their charity, all the\nproceedings of the justest cause are inevitably wicked. For it ought to\nbe an established maxim with all Christians, that however just a cause\nmay be, no lawsuit can ever be carried on in a proper manner by any man,\nwho does not feel as much benevolence and affection towards his\nadversary, as if the business in dispute had already been settled and\nterminated by an amicable adjustment. Some, perhaps, will object, that\nsuch moderation in lawsuits is far from being ever practised, and that\nif one instance of it were to be found, it would be regarded as a\nprodigy. I confess, indeed, that, in the corruption of these times, the\nexample of an upright litigator is very rare; but the thing itself\nceases not to be good and pure, if it be not defiled by an adventitious\nevil. But when we hear that the assistance of the magistrate is a holy\ngift of God, it behoves us to use the more assiduous caution that it be\nnot contaminated by our guilt.\nXIX. Those who positively condemn all controversies at law, ought to\nunderstand that they thereby reject a holy ordinance of God, and a gift\nof the number of those which may be “pure to the pure;” unless they mean\nto charge Paul with a crime, who repelled the calumnies of his accusers,\nexposing their subtlety and malice; who, before his judges, asserted his\nright to the privileges of a Roman citizen; and who, when he found it\nnecessary, appealed from an unjust governor to the tribunal of Cæsar. It\nis no objection to this that all Christians are forbidden the desire of\nrevenge, which we also wish to banish to the greatest distance from all\nChristian judicatures. For, in a civil cause, no man proceeds in the\nright way, who does not, with innocent simplicity, commit his cause to\nthe judge as to a public guardian, without the least thought of a mutual\nretaliation of evil, which is the passion of revenge. And in any more\nimportant or criminal action we require the accuser to be one who goes\ninto the court, influenced by no desire of revenge, affected by no\nresentment of private injury, and having no other motive than to resist\nthe attempts of a mischievous man, that he may not injure the public.\nBut if a vindictive spirit be excluded, no offence is committed against\nthat precept by which revenge is forbidden to Christians. It may\nprobably be objected, that they are not only forbidden to desire\nrevenge, but are also commanded to wait for the hand of the Lord, who\npromises that he will assist and revenge the afflicted and oppressed,\nand therefore that those who seek the interference of the magistrate on\nbehalf of themselves or others, anticipate all that vengeance of the\ncelestial protector. But this is very far from the truth. For the\nvengeance of the magistrate is to be considered, not as the vengeance of\nman, but of God, which, according to the testimony of Paul, he exercises\nby the ministry of men for our good.\nXX. Nor do we any more oppose the prohibition and injunction of Christ,\n“Resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek,\nturn to him the other also; and if any man will sue thee at the law, and\ntake away, thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.”[1456] In this\npassage, indeed, he requires the minds of his servants to be so far from\ncherishing a desire of retaliation, as rather to suffer the repetition\nof an injury against themselves than to wish to revenge it; nor do we\ndissuade them from this patience. For it truly behoves Christians to be\na people, as it were, formed to bear injuries and reproaches, exposed to\nthe iniquity, impostures, and ridicule of the worst of mankind; and not\nonly so, but they ought to be patient under all these evils; that is to\nsay, so calm and composed in their minds, that, after having suffered\none affliction, they may prepare themselves for another, expecting\nnothing all their lifetime but to bear a perpetual cross. At the same\ntime, they are required to bless and pray for them from whom they\nreceive curses, to do good to them from whom they experience\ninjuries,[1457] and to aim at that which constitutes their only victory,\nto “overcome evil with good.”[1458] With this disposition they will not\ndemand “an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,” as the Pharisees\ntaught their disciples to desire revenge; but, as we are instructed by\nChrist, they will suffer injuries in their persons and property in such\na manner as to be ready to forgive them as soon as they are\ncommitted.[1459] Yet this equanimity and moderation will be no obstacle,\nbut that, without any breach of friendship towards their enemies, they\nmay avail themselves of the assistance of the magistrate for the\npreservation of their property; or, from zeal for the public good, may\nbring a pestilent offender to justice, though they know he can only be\npunished with death. For it is very correctly explained by Augustine,\nthat the end of all these precepts is, “that a just and pious man should\nbe ready to bear with patience the wickedness of those whom he desires\nto become good; rather in order that the number of the good may\nincrease, not that with similar wickedness he may himself join the\nnumber of the evil; and in the next place, that they relate to the\ninternal affection of the heart more than to the external actions; in\norder that in the secrecy of our minds we may feel patience and\nbenevolence, but in our outward conduct may do that which we see tends\nto the advantage of those to whom we ought to feel benevolent\naffections.”\nXXI. The objection which is frequently alleged, that lawsuits are\nuniversally condemned by Paul, has no foundation in truth.[1460] It may\nbe easily understood from his words, that in the Church of the\nCorinthians there was an immoderate rage for litigation, so that they\nexposed the gospel of Christ, and all the religion which they professed,\nto the cavils and reproaches of the impious. The first thing which Paul\nreprehended in them was, that the intemperance of their dissensions\nbrought the gospel into discredit among unbelievers. And the next thing\nwas, that they had such altercations among them, brethren with brethren;\nfor they were so far from bearing an injury, that they coveted each\nother’s property, and molested and injured one another without any\nprovocation. It was against that rage for litigation, therefore, that he\ninveighed, and not absolutely against all controversies. But he\npronounces it to be altogether a vice or a weakness, that they did not\nsuffer the injury or loss of their property rather than to proceed to\ncontentions for the preservation of it: when they were so disturbed or\nexasperated at every loss or injury, that they had recourse to lawsuits\non the most trivial occasions, he argues that this proved their minds to\nbe too irritable, and not sufficiently patient. It is certainly\nincumbent on Christians, in all cases, to prefer a concession of their\nright to an entrance on a lawsuit; from which they can scarcely come out\nwithout a mind exasperated and inflamed with enmity to their brother.\nBut when one sees that, without any breach of charity, he may defend his\nproperty, the loss of which would be a serious injury to him; if he do\nit, he commits no offence against that sentence of Paul. In a word, as\nwe have observed at the beginning, charity will give every one the best\ncounsel; for, whatever litigations are undertaken without charity, or\nare carried to a degree inconsistent with it, we conclude them, beyond\nall controversy, to be unjust and wicked.\nXXII. The first duty of subjects towards their magistrates is to\nentertain the most honourable sentiments of their function, which they\nknow to be a jurisdiction delegated to them from God, and on that\naccount to esteem and reverence them as God’s ministers and vicegerents.\nFor there are some persons to be found, who show themselves very\nobedient to their magistrates, and have not the least wish that there\nwere no magistrates for them to obey, because they know them to be so\nnecessary to the public good; but who, nevertheless, consider the\nmagistrates themselves as no other than necessary evils. But something\nmore than this is required of us by Peter, when he commands us to\n“honour the king;”[1461] and by Solomon, when he says, “Fear thou the\nLord and the king;”[1462] for Peter, under the term _honour_,\ncomprehends a sincere and candid esteem; and Solomon, by connecting the\nking with the Lord, attributes to him a kind of sacred veneration and\ndignity. It is also a remarkable commendation of magistrates which is\ngiven by Paul, when he says, that we “must needs be subject, not only\nfor wrath, but also for conscience sake;”[1463] by which he means, that\nsubjects ought to be induced to submit to princes and governors, not\nmerely from a dread of their power, as persons are accustomed to yield\nto an armed enemy, who they know will immediately take vengeance upon\nthem if they resist; but because the obedience which is rendered to\nprinces and magistrates is rendered to God, from whom they have received\ntheir authority. I am not speaking of the persons, as if the mask of\ndignity ought to palliate or excuse folly, ignorance, or cruelty, and\nconduct the most nefarious and flagitious, and so to acquire for vices\nthe praise due to virtues; but I affirm that the station itself is\nworthy of honour and reverence; so that, whoever our governors are, they\nought to possess our esteem and veneration on account of the office\nwhich they fill.\nXXIII. Hence follows another duty, that, with minds disposed to honour\nand reverence magistrates, subjects approve their obedience to them, in\nsubmitting to their edicts, in paying taxes, in discharging public\nduties, and bearing burdens which relate to the common defence, and in\nfulfilling all their other commands. Paul says to the Romans, “Let every\nsoul be subject unto the higher powers. Whosoever resisteth the power,\nresisteth the ordinance of God.”[1464] He writes to Titus, “Put them in\nmind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to\nbe ready to every good work.”[1465] Peter exhorts, “Submit yourselves to\nevery ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake; whether it be to the king,\nas supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the\npunishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do\nwell.”[1466] Moreover, that subjects may testify that theirs is not a\nhypocritical but a sincere and cordial submission, Paul teaches, that\nthey ought to pray to God for the safety and prosperity of those under\nwhose government they live. “I exhort,” he says, “that supplications,\nprayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for\nkings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and\npeaceable life in all godliness and honesty.”[1467] Here let no man\ndeceive himself. For as it is impossible to resist the magistrate\nwithout, at the same time, resisting God himself; though an unarmed\nmagistrate may seem to be despised with impunity, yet God is armed to\ninflict exemplary vengeance on the contempt offered to himself. Under\nthis obedience I also include the moderation which private persons ought\nto prescribe to themselves in relation to public affairs, that they do\nnot, without being called upon, intermeddle with affairs of state, or\nrashly intrude themselves into the office of magistrates, or undertake\nany thing of a public nature. If there be any thing in the public\nadministration which requires to be corrected, let them not raise any\ntumults, or take the business into their own hands, which ought to be\nall bound in this respect, but let them refer it to the cognizance of\nthe magistrate, who is alone authorized to regulate the concerns of the\npublic. I mean, that they ought to attempt nothing without being\ncommanded; for when they have the command of a governor, then they also\nare invested with public authority. For, as we are accustomed to call\nthe counsellors of a prince _his eyes and ears_, so they may not unaptly\nbe called _his hands_ whom he has commissioned to execute his commands.\nXXIV. Now, as we have hitherto described a magistrate who truly answers\nto his title; who is the father of his country, and, as the poet calls\nhim, the pastor of his people, the guardian of peace, the protector of\njustice, the avenger of innocence; he would justly be deemed insane who\ndisapproved of such a government. But, as it has happened, in almost all\nages, that some princes, regardless of every thing to which they ought\nto have directed their attention and provision, give themselves up to\ntheir pleasures in indolent exemption from every care; others, absorbed\nin their own interest, expose to sale all laws, privileges, rights, and\njudgments; others plunder the public of wealth, which they afterwards\nlavish in mad prodigality; others commit flagrant outrages, pillaging\nhouses, violating virgins and matrons, and murdering infants; many\npersons cannot be persuaded that such ought to be acknowledged as\nprinces, whom, as far as possible, they ought to obey. For in such\nenormities, and actions so completely incompatible, not only with the\noffice of a magistrate, but with the duty of every man, they discover no\nappearance of the image of God, which ought to be conspicuous in a\nmagistrate; while they perceive no vestige of that minister of God who\nis “not a terror to good works, but to the evil,” who is sent “for the\npunishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well;” nor\nrecognize that governor, whose dignity and authority the Scripture\nrecommends to us. And certainly the minds of men have always been\nnaturally disposed to hate and execrate tyrants as much as to love and\nreverence legitimate kings.\nXXV. But, if we direct our attention to the word of God, it will carry\nus much further; even to submit to the government, not only of those\nprinces who discharge their duty to us with becoming integrity and\nfidelity, but of all who possess the sovereignty, even though they\nperform none of the duties of their function. For, though the Lord\ntestifies that the magistrate is an eminent gift of his liberality to\npreserve the safety of men, and prescribes to magistrates themselves the\nextent of their duty, yet he at the same time declares, that whatever be\ntheir characters, they have their government only from him; that those\nwho govern for the public good are true specimens and mirrors of his\nbeneficence; and that those who rule in an unjust and tyrannical manner\nare raised up by him to punish the iniquity of the people; that all\nequally possess that sacred majesty with which he has invested\nlegitimate authority. I will not proceed any further till I have\nsubjoined a few testimonies in proof of this point. It is unnecessary,\nhowever, to labour much to evince an impious king to be a judgment of\nGod’s wrath upon the world, as I have no expectation that any one will\ndeny it: and in this we say no more of a king than of any other robber\nwho plunders our property; or adulterer who violates our bed; or\nassassin who attempts to murder us; since the Scripture enumerates all\nthese calamities among the curses inflicted by God. But let us rather\ninsist on the proof of that which the minds of men do not so easily\nadmit; that a man of the worst character, and most undeserving of all\nhonour, who holds the sovereign power, really possesses that eminent and\nDivine authority, which the Lord has given by his word to the ministers\nof his justice and judgment; and, therefore, that he ought to be\nregarded by his subjects, as far as pertains to public obedience, with\nthe same reverence and esteem which they would show to the best of\nkings, if such a one were granted to them.\nXXVI. In the first place, I request my readers to observe and consider\nwith attention, what is so frequently and justly mentioned in the\nScriptures,—the providence and peculiar dispensation of God in\ndistributing kingdoms and appointing whom he pleases to be kings. Daniel\nsays, “God changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings and\nsetteth up kings.”[1468] Again: “That the living may know that the Most\nHigh ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he\nwill.”[1469] Passages of this kind abound throughout the Scriptures, but\nparticularly in this prophecy. Now, the character of Nebuchadnezzar, who\nconquered Jerusalem, is sufficiently known, that he was an invader and\ndepopulator of the territories of others. Yet by the mouth of Ezekiel\nthe Lord declares that he had given him the land of Egypt, as a reward\nfor the service which he had performed in devastating Tyre.[1470] And\nDaniel said to him, “Thou, O king, art a king of kings; for the God of\nheaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory; and\nwheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field, and the\nfowls of the heaven, hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee\nruler over all.”[1471] Again: to his grandson Belshazzar Daniel said,\n“The most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and\nmajesty, and glory, and honour; and for the majesty that he gave him,\nall people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before\nhim.”[1472] When we hear that Nebuchadnezzar was placed on the throne by\nGod, let us, at the same time, call to mind the celestial edicts which\ncommand us to fear and honour the king; and we shall not hesitate to\nregard the most iniquitous tyrant with the honour due to the station in\nwhich the Lord has deigned to place him. When Samuel denounced to the\nchildren of Israel what treatment they would receive from their kings,\nhe said, “This will be the manner[1473] of the king that shall reign\nover you; he will take your sons and appoint them for himself, for his\nchariots, and to be his horsemen, and to ear his ground, and to reap his\nharvest, and to make his instruments of war. And he will take your\ndaughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And\nhe will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even\nthe best of them, and give them to his servants. And he will take the\ntenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers and\nto his servants. And he will take your men-servants, and your\nmaid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put\nthem to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep; and ye shall be\nhis servants.”[1474] Certainly the kings would not do all this by\n“right,” for they were excellently instructed by the law to observe all\nmoderation; but it was called a “right” with respect to the people who\nwere bound to obey, and were not at liberty to resist it. It was just as\nif Samuel had said, The cupidity of your kings will proceed to all these\noutrages, which it will not be your province to restrain; nothing will\nremain for you, but to receive their commands and to obey them.\nXXVII. But the most remarkable and memorable passage of all is in the\nProphecy of Jeremiah, which, though it is rather long, I shall readily\nquote, because it most clearly decides the whole question: “I have made\nthe earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great\npower and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed\nmeet unto me. And now I have given all these lands into the hand of\nNebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant. And all nations shall\nserve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the very time of his\nland come. And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which\nwill not serve the same king of Babylon, that nation will I punish with\nthe sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence. Therefore serve\nthe king of Babylon and live.”[1475] We see what great obedience and\nhonour the Lord required to be rendered to that pestilent and cruel\ntyrant, for no other reason than because he possessed the kingdom; and\nit was by the heavenly decree that he was seated on the throne of the\nkingdom, and exalted to that regal majesty, which it was not lawful to\nviolate. If we have this constantly present to our eyes and impressed\nupon our hearts, that the most iniquitous kings are placed on their\nthrones by the same decree by which the authority of all kings is\nestablished, those seditious thoughts will never enter our minds, that a\nking is to be treated according to his merits, and that it is not\nreasonable for us to be subject to a king who does not on his part\nperform towards us those duties which his office requires.\nXXVIII. In vain will any one object that this was a special command\ngiven to the Israelites. For we must observe the reason upon which the\nLord founds it. He says, “I have given these lands to Nebuchadnezzar;\ntherefore serve him and live.” To whomsoever, therefore, a kingdom shall\nevidently be given, we have no room to doubt that subjection is due to\nhim. And as soon as he exalts any person to royal dignity, he gives us a\ndeclaration of his pleasure that he shall reign. The Scripture contains\ngeneral testimonies on this subject. Solomon says, “For the\ntransgression of a land, many are the princes thereof.”[1476] Job says,\n“He looseth the bonds of kings,” or divests them of their power; “and\ngirdeth their loins with a girdle,”[1477] or restores them to their\nformer dignity. This being admitted, nothing remains for us but to serve\nand live. The prophet Jeremiah likewise records another command of the\nLord to his people: “Seek the peace of the city whither I have caused\nyou to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it; for in\nthe peace of it ye shall have peace.”[1478] Here, we see, the\nIsraelites, after having been stripped of all their property, torn from\ntheir habitations, driven into exile, and forced into a miserable\nservitude, were commanded to pray for the prosperity of their conqueror;\nnot in the same manner in which we are all commanded to pray for our\npersecutors; but that his kingdom might be preserved in safety and\ntranquillity, and that they might live in prosperity under him. Thus\nDavid, after having been already designated as king by the ordination of\nGod, and anointed with his holy oil, though he was unjustly persecuted\nby Saul, without having given him any cause of offence, nevertheless\naccounted the person of his pursuer sacred, because the Lord had\nconsecrated it by the royal dignity. “And he said, The Lord forbid that\nI should do this thing unto my master, the Lord’s anointed, to stretch\nforth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.”\nAgain: “Mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand\nagainst my lord; for he is the Lord’s anointed.”[1479] Again: “Who can\nstretch forth his hand against the Lord’s anointed, and be guiltless? As\nthe Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die,\nor he shall descend into battle, and perish. The Lord forbid that I\nshould stretch forth mine hand against the Lord’s anointed.”[1480]\nXXIX. Finally, we owe these sentiments of affection and reverence to all\nour rulers, whatever their characters may be; which I the more\nfrequently repeat, that we may learn not to scrutinize the persons\nthemselves, but may be satisfied with knowing that they are invested by\nthe will of the Lord with that function, upon which he has impressed an\ninviolable majesty. But it will be said, that rulers owe mutual duties\nto their subjects. That I have already confessed. But he who infers from\nthis that obedience ought to be rendered to none but just rulers, is a\nvery bad reasoner. For husbands owe mutual duties to their wives, and\nparents to their children. Now, if husbands and parents violate their\nobligations; if parents conduct themselves with discouraging severity\nand fastidious moroseness towards their children, whom they are\nforbidden to provoke to wrath;[1481] if husbands despise and vex their\nwives, whom they are commanded to love and to spare as the weaker\nvessels;[1482] does it follow that children should be less obedient to\ntheir parents, or wives to their husbands? They are still subject, even\nto those who are wicked and unkind. As it is incumbent on all, not to\ninquire into the duties of one another, but to confine their attention\nrespectively to their own, this consideration ought particularly to be\nregarded by those who are subject to the authority of others. Wherefore,\nif we are inhumanly harassed by a cruel prince; if we are rapaciously\nplundered by an avaricious or luxurious one; if we are neglected by an\nindolent one; or if we are persecuted, on account of piety, by an\nimpious and sacrilegious one,—let us first call to mind our\ntransgressions against God, which he undoubtedly chastises by these\nscourges. Thus our impatience will be restrained by humility. Let us, in\nthe next place, consider that it is not our province to remedy these\nevils; and that nothing remains for us, but to implore the aid of the\nLord, in whose hand are the hearts of kings and the revolutions of\nkingdoms. It is “God” who “standeth in the congregation of the mighty,”\nand “judgeth among the gods;”[1483] whose presence shall confound and\ncrush all kings and judges of the earth who shall not have kissed his\nSon;[1484] “that decree unrighteous decrees, to turn aside the needy\nfrom judgment, and to take away the right from the poor, that widows may\nbe their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless.”[1485]\nXXX. And here is displayed his wonderful goodness, and power, and\nprovidence; for sometimes he raises up some of his servants as public\navengers, and arms them with his commission to punish unrighteous\ndomination, and to deliver from their distressing calamities a people\nwho have been unjustly oppressed: sometimes he accomplishes this end by\nthe fury of men who meditate and attempt something altogether different.\nThus he liberated the people of Israel from the tyranny of Pharaoh by\nMoses; from the oppression of Chusan by Othniel; and from other yokes by\nother kings and judges. Thus he subdued the pride of Tyre by the\nEgyptians; the insolence of the Egyptians by the Assyrians; the\nhaughtiness of the Assyrians by the Chaldeans; the confidence of Babylon\nby the Medes and Persians, after Cyrus had subjugated the Medes. The\ningratitude of the kings of Israel and Judah, and their impious\nrebellion, notwithstanding his numerous favours, he repressed and\npunished, sometimes by the Assyrians, sometimes by the Babylonians.\nThese were all the executioners of his vengeance, but not all in the\nsame manner. The former, when they were called forth to the performance\nof such acts by a legitimate commission from God, in taking arms against\nkings, were not chargeable with the least violation of that majesty with\nwhich kings are invested by the ordination of God; but, being armed with\nauthority from Heaven, they punished an inferior power by a superior\none, as it is lawful for kings to punish their inferior officers. The\nlatter, though they were guided by the hand of God in such directions as\nhe pleased, and performed his work without being conscious of it,\nnevertheless contemplated in their hearts nothing but evil.\nXXXI. But whatever opinion be formed of the acts of men, yet the Lord\nequally executed his work by them, when he broke the sanguinary sceptres\nof insolent kings, and overturned tyrannical governments. Let princes\nhear and fear. But, in the mean while, it behoves us to use the greatest\ncaution, that we do not despise or violate that authority of\nmagistrates, which is entitled to the greatest veneration, which God has\nestablished by the most solemn commands, even though it reside in those\nwho are most unworthy of it, and who, as far as in them lies, pollute it\nby their iniquity. For though the correction of tyrannical domination is\nthe vengeance of God, we are not, therefore, to conclude that it is\ncommitted to us, who have received no other command than to obey and\nsuffer. This observation I always apply to private persons. For if there\nbe, in the present day, any magistrates appointed for the protection of\nthe people and the moderation of the power of kings, such as were, in\nancient times, the Ephori, who were a check upon the kings among the\nLacedæmonians, or the popular tribunes upon the consuls among the\nRomans, or the Demarchi upon the senate among the Athenians; or with\npower such as perhaps is now possessed by the three estates in every\nkingdom when they are assembled; I am so far from prohibiting them, in\nthe discharge of their duty, to oppose the violence or cruelty of kings,\nthat I affirm, that if they connive at kings in their oppression of\ntheir people, such forbearance involves the most nefarious perfidy,\nbecause they fraudulently betray the liberty of the people, of which\nthey know that they have been appointed protectors by the ordination of\nGod.\nXXXII. But in the obedience which we have shown to be due to the\nauthority of governors, it is always necessary to make one exception,\nand that is entitled to our first attention,—that it do not seduce us\nfrom obedience to him, to whose will the desires of all kings ought to\nbe subject, to whose decrees all their commands ought to yield, to whose\nmajesty all their sceptres ought to submit. And, indeed, how\npreposterous it would be for us, with a view to satisfy men, to incur\nthe displeasure of him on whose account we yield obedience to men! The\nLord, therefore, is the King of kings; who, when he has opened his\nsacred mouth, is to be heard alone, above all, for all, and before all;\nin the next place, we are subject to those men who preside over us; but\nno otherwise than in him. If they command any thing against him, it\nought not to have the least attention; nor, in this case, ought we to\npay any regard to all that dignity attached to magistrates; to which no\ninjury is done when it is subjected to the unrivalled and supreme power\nof God. On this principle Daniel denied that he had committed any crime\nagainst the king in disobeying his impious decree;[1486] because the\nking had exceeded the limits of his office, and had not only done an\ninjury to men, but, by raising his arm against God, had degraded his own\nauthority. On the other hand, the Israelites are condemned for having\nbeen too submissive to the impious edict of their king. For when\nJeroboam had made his golden calves, in compliance with his will, they\ndeserted the temple of God and revolted to new superstitions. Their\nposterity conformed to the decrees of their idolatrous kings with the\nsame facility. The prophet severely condemns them for having “willingly\nwalked after the commandment:”[1487] so far is any praise from being due\nto the pretext of humility, with which courtly flatterers excuse\nthemselves and deceive the unwary, when they deny that it is lawful for\nthem to refuse compliance with any command of their kings; as if God had\nresigned his right to mortal men when he made them rulers of mankind; or\nas if earthly power were diminished by being subordinated to its author,\nbefore whom even the principalities of heaven tremble with awe. I know\nwhat great and present danger awaits this constancy, for kings cannot\nbear to be disregarded without the greatest indignation; and “the wrath\nof a king,” says Solomon, “is as messengers of death.”[1488] But since\nthis edict has been proclaimed by that celestial herald, Peter, “We\nought to obey God rather than men,”[1489]—let us console ourselves with\nthis thought, that we truly perform the obedience which God requires of\nus, when we suffer any thing rather than deviate from piety. And that\nour hearts may not fail us, Paul stimulates us with another\nconsideration—that Christ has redeemed us at the immense price which our\nredemption cost him, that we may not be submissive to the corrupt\ndesires of men, much less be slaves to their impiety.[1490]\nEND OF THE INSTITUTES.\nFootnote 1404:\nGal. v. 1.\nFootnote 1405:\n1 Cor. vii. 21.\nFootnote 1406:\nGal. iii. 28.\nFootnote 1407:\nCol. iii. 11.\nFootnote 1408:\nPsalm lxxxii. 1, 6.\nFootnote 1409:\nJohn x. 35.\nFootnote 1410:\nDeut. i. 16, 17. 2 Chron. xix. 6.\nFootnote 1411:\nProv. viii. 15, 16.\nFootnote 1412:\nRom. xii. 8.\nFootnote 1413:\n1 Cor. xii. 28.\nFootnote 1414:\nRom. xiii. 1, 3, 4.\nFootnote 1415:\nPsalm ii. 10-12.\nFootnote 1416:\nIsaiah xlix. 23.\nFootnote 1417:\n1 Tim. ii. 1, 2.\nFootnote 1418:\nJer. xlviii. 10.\nFootnote 1419:\nDeut. i. 16, 17.\nFootnote 1420:\n2 Chron. xix. 6, 7.\nFootnote 1421:\nPsalm lxxxii. 1.\nFootnote 1422:\n1 Sam. viii. 7.\nFootnote 1423:\nLuke xxii. 25, 26.\nFootnote 1424:\nRom. xiii. 1, &c.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."
