Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his\nwife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: O my dear\nwife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear\nfriend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard\nupon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our city\nwill be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow,\nboth myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall\nmiserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way\nof escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered. At this his\nrelations were sore amazed; not for that they believed that what\nhe had said to them was true, but because they thought that some\nfrenzy distemper had got into his head; therefore, it drawing\ntowards night, and they hoping that sleep might settle his brains,\nwith all haste they got him to bed. But the night was as troublesome\nto him as the day; wherefore, instead of sleeping, he spent it in\nsighs and tears. So, when the morning was come, they would know\nhow he did. He told them, Worse and worse: he also set to talking\nto them again; but they began to be hardened. They also thought\nto drive away his distemper by harsh and surly carriages to\nhim; sometimes they would deride, sometimes they would chide, and\nsometimes they would quite neglect him. Wherefore he began to\nretire himself to his chamber, to pray for and pity them, and also\nto condole his own misery; he would also walk solitarily in the\nfields, sometimes reading, and sometimes praying: and thus for\nsome days he spent his time."

If I go back to mine own country, that\nis prepared for fire and brimstone, and I shall certainly perish\nthere. If I can get to the Celestial City, I am sure to be in\nsafety there. I must venture. To go back is nothing but death;\nto go forward is fear of death, and life-everlasting beyond it. I\nwill yet go forward. So Mistrust and Timorous ran down the hill,\nand Christian went on his way. But, thinking again of what he had\nheard from the men, he felt in his bosom for his roll, that he\nmight read therein, and be comforted; but he felt, and found it\nnot. Then was Christian in great distress, and knew not what to\ndo; for he wanted that which used to relieve him, and that which\nshould have been his pass into the Celestial City. Here, therefore,\nhe begun to be much perplexed, and knew not what to do. At last\nhe bethought himself that he had slept in the arbour that is on\nthe side of the hill; and, falling down upon his knees, he asked\nGod's forgiveness for that his foolish act, and then went back to\nlook for his roll. But all the way he went back, who can sufficiently\nset forth the sorrow of Christian's heart? Sometimes he sighed,\nsometimes he wept, and oftentimes he chid himself for being so\nfoolish to fall asleep in that place, which was erected only for\na little refreshment for his weariness. Thus, therefore, he went\nback, carefully looking on this side and on that, all the way as he\nwent, if happily he might find his roll, that had been his comfort\nso many times in his journey. He went thus, till he came again\nwithin sight of the arbour where he sat and slept; but that sight\nrenewed his sorrow the more, by bringing again, even afresh, his\nevil of sleeping into his mind. [Rev. 2:5; 1 Thes. 5:7,8] Thus,\ntherefore, he now went on bewailing his sinful sleep, saying, O\nwretched man that I am that I should sleep in the day-time! that I\nshould sleep in the midst of difficulty! that I should so indulge\nthe flesh, as to use that rest for ease to my flesh, which the\nLord of the hill hath erected only for the relief of the spirits\nof pilgrims!"

I further\nasked him what house he kept, and what other servants he had. So\nhe told me that his house was maintained with all the dainties in\nthe world; and that his servants were those of his own begetting.\nThen I asked if he had any children. He said that he had but three\ndaughters: The Lust of the Flesh, The Lust of the Eyes, and The\nPride of Life, and that I should marry them all if I would.

The\nothers would be said nay, after a little argumentation, and somewhat\nelse; but this bold-faced Shame would never have done.\nCHR. Why, what did he say to you?\nFAITH. What! why, he objected against religion itself; he said it\nwas a pitiful, low, sneaking business for a man to mind religion;\nhe said that a tender conscience was an unmanly thing; and that\nfor a man to watch over his words and ways, so as to tie up himself\nfrom that hectoring liberty that the brave spirits of the times\naccustom themselves unto, would make him the ridicule of the times.\nHe objected also, that but few of the mighty, rich, or wise, were\never of my opinion [1 Cor. 1:26; 3:18; Phil. 3:7,8]; nor any of\nthem neither [John 7:48], before they were persuaded to be fools,\nand to be of a voluntary fondness, to venture the loss of all, for\nnobody knows what.

But at last I\nbegan to consider, that \"that which is highly esteemed among men,\nis had in abomination with God.\" [Luke 16:15] And I thought again,\nthis Shame tells me what men are; but it tells me nothing what God\nor the Word of God is. And I thought, moreover, that at the day\nof doom, we shall not be doomed to death or life according to the\nhectoring spirits of the world, but according to the wisdom and\nlaw of the Highest. Therefore, thought I, what God says is best,\nindeed is best, though all the men in the world are against it.\nSeeing, then, that God prefers his religion; seeing God prefers a\ntender conscience; seeing they that make themselves fools for the\nkingdom of heaven are wisest; and that the poor man that loveth\nChrist is richer than the greatest man in the world that hates\nhim; Shame, depart, thou art an enemy to my salvation! Shall I\nentertain thee against my sovereign Lord? How then shall I look\nhim in the face at his coming? Should I now be ashamed of his\nways and servants, how can I expect the blessing? [Mark 8:38] But,\nindeed, this Shame was a bold villain; I could scarce shake him\nout of my company; yea, he would be haunting of me, and continually\nwhispering me in the ear, with some one or other of the infirmities\nthat attend religion; but at last I told him it was but in vain to\nattempt further in this business; for those things that he disdained,\nin those did I see most glory; and so at last I got past this\nimportunate one. And when I had shaken him off, then I began to\nsing--\nThe trials that those men do meet withal,\nThat are obedient to the heavenly call,\nAre manifold, and suited to the flesh,\nAnd come, and come, and come again afresh;\nThat now, or sometime else, we by them may\nBe taken, overcome, and cast away.\nOh, let the pilgrims, let the pilgrims, then\nBe vigilant, and quit themselves like men."

Great knowledge of gospel mysteries.\nFAITH. This sign should have been first; but first or last, it is\nalso false; for knowledge, great knowledge, may be obtained in the\nmysteries of the gospel, and yet no work of grace in the soul. [1\nCor. 13] Yea, if a man have all knowledge, he may yet be nothing,\nand so consequently be no child of God. When Christ said, \"Do you\nknow all these things?\" and the disciples had answered, Yes; he\naddeth, \"Blessed are ye if ye do them.\" He doth not lay the blessing\nin the knowing of them, but in the doing of them. For there is\na knowledge that is not attended with doing: He that knoweth his\nmasters will, and doeth it not. A man may know like an angel, and\nyet be no Christian, therefore your sign of it is not true. Indeed,\nto know is a thing that pleaseth talkers and boasters, but to do is\nthat which pleaseth God. Not that the heart can be good without\nknowledge; for without that, the heart is naught. There is,\ntherefore, knowledge and knowledge. Knowledge that resteth in the\nbare speculation of things; and knowledge that is accompanied with\nthe grace of faith and love; which puts a man upon doing even the\nwill of God from the heart: the first of these will serve the\ntalker; but without the other the true Christian is not content.\n\"Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall\nobserve it with my whole heart.\" [Ps. 119:34]\nTALK.

At this Little-faith looked as white as a clout, and had\nneither power to fight nor fly. Then said Faint-heart, Deliver thy\npurse. But he making no haste to do it (for he was loath to lose\nhis money), Mistrust ran up to him, and thrusting his hand into\nhis pocket, pulled out thence a bag of silver. Then he cried out,\nThieves! Thieves! With that Guilt, with a great club that was\nin his hand, struck Little-faith on the head, and with that blow\nfelled him flat to the ground, where he lay bleeding as one that\nwould bleed to death. All this while the thieves stood by. But,\nat last, they hearing that some were upon the road, and fearing\nlest it should be one Great-grace, that dwells in the city of\nGood-confidence, they betook themselves to their heels, and left\nthis good man to shift for himself.

[Jer. 2:24] When their minds are set upon their lusts,\nthey will have them whatever they cost. But Little-faith was of\nanother temper, his mind was on things divine; his livelihood was\nupon things that were spiritual, and from above; therefore, to what\nend should he that is of such a temper sell his jewels (had there\nbeen any that would have bought them) to fill his mind with empty\nthings? Will a man give a penny to fill his belly with hay; or can\nyou persuade the turtle-dove to live upon carrion like the crow?\nThough faithless ones can, for carnal lusts, pawn, or mortgage,\nor sell what they have, and themselves outright to boot; yet they\nthat have faith, saving faith, though but a little of it, cannot\ndo so.

I have, by my sins, run a\ngreat way into God's book, and that my now reforming will not pay\noff that score; therefore I should think still, under all my present\namendments, But how shall I be freed from that damnation that I\nhave brought myself in danger of by my former transgressions?"

Now, upon the bank of\nthe river, on the other side, they saw the two shining men again,\nwho there waited for them; wherefore, being come out of the river,\nthey saluted them, saying, We are ministering spirits, sent forth\nto minister for those that shall be heirs of salvation. Thus they\nwent along towards the gate."

They, therefore, went up\nhere with much agility and speed, though the foundation upon which\nthe city was framed was higher than the clouds. They therefore\nwent up through the regions of the air, sweetly talking as they\nwent, being comforted, because they safely got over the river, and\nhad such glorious companions to attend them.\nNow, now, look how the holy pilgrims ride, Clouds are their\nchariots, angels are their guide: Who would not here for him all\nhazards run, That thus provides for his when this world's done?"

There, said they, is the Mount Zion, the heavenly\nJerusalem, the innumerable company of angels, and the spirits of\njust men made perfect. [Heb. 12:22-24] You are going now, said\nthey, to the paradise of God, wherein you shall see the tree of\nlife, and eat of the never-fading fruits thereof; and when you come\nthere, you shall have white robes given you, and your walk and talk\nshall be every day with the King, even all the days of eternity.\n[Rev. 2:7, 3:4, 21:4,5] There you shall not see again such things\nas you saw when you were in the lower region upon the earth, to\nwit, sorrow, sickness, affliction, and death, for the former things\nare passed away. You are now going to Abraham, to Isaac, and Jacob,\nand to the prophets--men that God hath taken away from the evil\nto come, and that are now resting upon their beds, each one walking\nin his righteousness. [Isa. 57:1,2, 65:17] The men then asked,\nWhat must we do in the holy place? To whom it was answered, You\nmust there receive the comforts of all your toil, and have joy for\nall your sorrow; you must reap what you have sown, even the fruit\nof all your prayers, and tears, and sufferings for the King by the\nway. [Gal. 6:7] In that place you must wear crowns of gold, and\nenjoy the perpetual sight and vision of the Holy One, for there you\nshall see him as he is. [1 John 3:2] There also you shall serve\nhim continually with praise, with shouting, and thanksgiving, whom\nyou desired to serve in the world, though with much difficulty,\nbecause of the infirmity of your flesh. There your eyes shall\nbe delighted with seeing, and your ears with hearing the pleasant\nvoice of the Mighty One. There you shall enjoy your friends again\nthat are gone thither before you; and there you shall with joy\nreceive, even every one that follows into the holy place after\nyou. There also shall you be clothed with glory and majesty, and\nput into an equipage fit to ride out with the King of Glory. When\nhe shall come with sound of trumpet in the clouds, as upon the\nwings of the wind, you shall come with him; and when he shall sit\nupon the throne of judgment; you shall sit by him; yea, and when\nhe shall pass sentence upon all the workers of iniquity, let them\nbe angels or men, you also shall have a voice in that judgment,\nbecause they were his and your enemies. [1 Thes. 4:13-16, Jude\n1:14, Dan. 7:9,10, 1 Cor. 6:2,3] Also, when he shall again return\nto the city, you shall go too, with sound of trumpet, and be ever\nwith him."

Then the heavenly\nhost gave a great shout, saying, \"Blessed are they which are called\nunto the marriage supper of the Lamb.\" [Rev. 19:9] There came out\nalso at this time to meet them, several of the King's trumpeters,\nclothed in white and shining raiment, who, with melodious noises,\nand loud, made even the heavens to echo with their sound. These\ntrumpeters saluted Christian and his fellow with ten thousand\nwelcomes from the world; and this they did with shouting, and sound\nof trumpet."

Thus, therefore, they walked\non together; and as they walked, ever and anon these trumpeters,\neven with joyful sound, would, by mixing their music with looks and\ngestures, still signify to Christian and his brother, how welcome\nthey were into their company, and with what gladness they came to\nmeet them; and now were these two men, as it were, in heaven, before\nthey came at it, being swallowed up with the sight of angels, and\nwith hearing of their melodious notes. Here also they had the city\nitself in view, and they thought they heard all the bells therein\nto ring, to welcome them thereto.

For it happened that there was then\nin that place, one Vain-hope, a ferryman, that with his boat helped\nhim over; so he, as the other I saw, did ascend the hill, to come\nup to the gate, only he came alone; neither did any man meet him\nwith the least encouragement. When he was come up to the gate, he\nlooked up to the writing that was above, and then began to knock,\nsupposing that entrance should have been quickly administered to\nhim; but he was asked by the men that looked over the top of the\ngate, Whence came you, and what would you have? He answered, I\nhave eat and drank in the presence of the King, and he has taught\nin our streets. Then they asked him for his certificate, that they\nmight go in and show it to the King; so he fumbled in his bosom\nfor one, and found none. Then said they, Have you none? But the\nman answered never a word. So they told the King, but he would\nnot come down to see him, but commanded the two Shining Ones that\nconducted Christian and Hopeful to the City, to go out and take\nIgnorance, and bind him hand and foot, and have him away. Then\nthey took him up, and carried him through the air to the door that\nI saw in the side of the hill, and put him in there. Then I saw\nthat there was a way to hell, even from the gates of heaven, as\nwell as from the City of Destruction. So I awoke, and behold it\nwas a dream."
