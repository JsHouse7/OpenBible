Till  this  instance,  I  have  seemed \nwilling  not  only  to  lay  hold  on  such  opportunities \nof  writing  when  they  occurred  to  me,  but  even  to  go \nin  search  of  them  without  provocation.  Some  per- \nhaps will  be  ready  to  wonder  at  this  new  and  un- \nusual patience,  as  it  may  be,  or  fear  of  Luther's  • \nwho  has  not  been  roused  from  his  silence  even \nby  so  many  speeches  and  letters  which  have  been \nbandied  to  and  fro  amongst  his  adversaries, \ncongratulating  Erasmus  upon  his  victory,  and \nchaunting  an  lo  Psean.     '  So  then,  this  Macca- \n\na  Diatribe.']  One  of  the  names  by  which  Erasmus  chose  to \ndistinguish  his  performance  on  Freewill.  He  borrows  it  from \nthe  debates  of  the  ancient  philosophers  ;  and  would  be  under- \nstood to  announce  a  canvassing  of  the  question  rather  than \na  judicial  determination  upon  it.  The  original  Greek  term \ndenotes,  1.  The  place  trodden  by  the  feet  whilst  they  were \nengaged  in  the  debate.  2.  The  time  spent  in  such  debate. \n3.  The  debate  itself.  Erasmus's  Diatribe,  therefore,  is  '  a \ndisquisition,  or  disputation/  on  Freewill.  Luther  often  per- \nsonifies it. \n\nb2 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\nbaeus  and  most  inflexible  Assertor  has  at  length \nfound  an  antagonist  worthy  of  him,  whom  he  does \nnot  dare  to  open  his  mouth  against !' \n\nI  am  so  far  from  blaming  these  men,  however, \nthat  I  am  quite  ready  to  yield  a  palm  to  you \nmyself,  such  as  I  never  yet  did  to  any  man  ;  ad- \nmitting, that  you  not  only  very  far  excel  me  in \neloquence  and  genius  (a  palm  which  we  all  de- \nservedly yield  to  you — how  much  more  such  a \nman  as  I;  a  barbarian  who  have  always  dwelt \namidst  barbarism),  but  that  you  have  checked \nboth  my  spirit  and  my  inclination  to  answer  you, \nand  have  made  me  languid  before  the  battle. \nThis  you  have  done  twice  over:  first,  by  your  art \nin  pleading  this  cause  with  such  a  wonderful  com- \nmand of  temper,  from  first  to  last,  that  you  have \nmade  it  impossible  for  me  to  be  angry  with  you; \nand  secondly,  by  contriving,  through  fortune,  ac- \ncident or  fate,  to  say  nothing  on  this  great  sub- \nject which  has  not  been  said  before.  In  fact,  you \nsay  so  much  less  for  Freewill,  and  yet  ascribe  so \nmuch  more  to  it,  than  the  Sophists6  have  done \nbefore  you  (of  which  I  shall  speak  more  at  large \nhereafter),  that  it  seemed  quite  superfluous  to  an- \nswer those  arguments  of  yours  which  I  have  so \noften  confuted  myself,  and  which  have  been  trod- \nden under  foot,  and  crushed  to  atoms,  by  Philip \nMelancthon's  invincible   '  Common  Places.' c     In \n\nb  The  schoolmen,  with  Peter  Lombard  at  their  head,  who \narose  about  the  middle  of  the  twelfth  century  j  idolizers  of \nAristotle  j  their  theology  abounding  with  metaphysical  subtil- \nties,  and  their  disputations  greatly  resembling  those  of  the \nGreek  sophists. \n\nc  Luther  refers  to  the  former  editions  of  Melancthon's \n*  Common  Places,\"  which  contained  some  passages  not  found \nin  the  later  ones  3  this  amongst  others.  '  The  divine  pre- \ndestination takes  away  liberty*  from  man  :  for  all  things  happen \naccording  to  divine  predestination  ;  as  well  the  external  ac- \ntions as  the  internal  thoughts  of  all  creatures. .  . .  The  judgment \nof  the  flesh  abhors  this  sentiment,  but  the  judgment  of  the \n\n*  Not  '  choice/  but  s  unbiassed  choice  j\"  '  freeness  and  contingency  of \nchoice.'— Ed. \n\n\nINTRODUCTION. \n\nmy  judgment,  that  work  of  his  deserves  not  only  to \nbe  immortalized,  but  even  canonized.  So  mean  and \nworthless  did  yours  appear,  when  compared  with  it, \nthat  I  exceedingly  pitied  you,  who  were  polluting \nyour  most  elegant  and  ingenious  diction  with  such \nfilth  of  argument,  and  was  quite  angry  with  your \nmost  unworthy  matter,  for  being  conveyed  in  so \nrichly  ornamented  a  style  of  eloquence.  It  is  just \nas  if  the  sweepings  of  the  house  or  of  the  stable \nwere  borne  about  on  men's  shoulders  in  vases  of \ngold  and  silver !  You  seem  to  have  been  sensi- \nble of  this  yourself,  from  the  difficulty  with  which \nyou  was  persuaded  to  undertake  the  office  of \nwriting,  on  this  occasion ;  your  conscience,  no \ndoubt,  admonishing  you,  that  with  whatever  pow- \ners of  eloquence  you  might  attempt  the  subject, \nit  would  be  impossible  so  to  gloss  it  over  that  I \nshould  not  discover  the  excrementitious  nature  of \nyour  matter  through  all  the  tricksy  ornaments  of \nphrase  with  which  you  might  cover  it ;  that  / \nshould  not  discover  it,  I  say;  who,  though  rude \nin  speech,  am,  by  the  grace  of  God,  not  rude  in \nknowledge.  For  I  do  not  hesitate,  with  Paul, \nthus  to  claim  the  gift  of  knowledge  for  myself, \n\n\nspirit  embraces  it.  For  you  will  not  learn  the  fear  of  God,,  or \nconfidence  in  Him,  from  any  source  more  surely  than  when \nyou  shall  have  imbued  your  mind  with  this  sentiment  concern- \ning predestination.' — It  is  to  passages  such  as  these  that  Luther \ndoubtless  refers  in  the  testimony  here  given  to  Melancthon's \nwork  ;  and  from  the  withdrawing  of  which  in  subsequent  edi- \ntions, it  has  been  inferred  that  Melancthon  afterwards  changed \nhis  sentiments  upon  these  subjects.  The  late  Dean  of  Car- \nlisle has  investigated  this  supposition  with  his  usual  accuracy \nand  diligence  5  and  concludes  that  he  probably  did  alter  his \nearlier  sentiments  to  some  extent  in  later  life.

But  after  all,  what  do  these \nprove  ?

If  there  be  those  who  have  neither  drunk \ndeeper  into  our  writings,  nor  yet  more  firmly \nmaintain  them,  (fortified  as  they  are  by  such  an \naccumulation  of  Scripture  proofs)  than  to  be \nshaken  by  those  trifling  or  good  for  nothing  argu- \nments of  Erasmus,  though  dressed  out,  I  admit, \nin  the  most  engaging  apparel ;  such  persons  are \nnot  worth  being  cured  by  an  answer  from  me:  for \nnothing  could  be  said  or  written  which  would  be \nsufficient  for  such  men,  though  many  thousands  of \nbooks  should  be  repeated  even  a  thousand  times \nover.  You  might  just  as  well  plough  the  sea- \nshore and  cast  your  seed  into  the  sand,  or  fill  a  cask, \nthat  is  full  of  holes,  with  water.  We  have  mi- \nnistered abundantly  to  those  who  have  drunk  of \nthe  Spirit  as  their  teacher  through  the  instru- \nmentality of  our  books,  and  they  perfectly  despise \nyour  performances;  and  as  for  those  who  read \nwithout  the  Spirit,  it  is  no  wonder  if  they  be \ndriven  like  the  seed  with  every  wind.  To  such \npersons  God  would  not  say  enough,  if  he  were \nto  convert  all  his  creatures  into  tongues.  So  that \nI  should  almost  have  determined  to  leave  these \npersons,  stumbled  as  they  were  by  your  publication, \nwith  the  crowd  which  glories  in  you  and  decrees \nyou  a  triumph. \n\nYou  see  then,  that  it  is  neither  the  multitude \nof  my  engagements,  nor  the  difficulty  of  the  under- \ntaking, nor  the  vastness  of  your  eloquence,  nor \nany  fear  of  you,  but  mere  disgust,  indignation, \nand  contempt ;  or,  to  say  the  truth,  my  deliberate \njudgment  respecting  your  Diatribe,  which  has \nrestrained  the  impulse  of  my  mind  to  answer  you: \nnot  to  mention  what  has  also  its  place  here,  that \never  like  yourself  you  with  the  greatest  pertina- \n\n\nINTRODUCTION,  7 \n\ncity  take  care  to  be  always  evasive  and  ambi- \nguous/ More  cautious  than  Ulysses,  you  (latter \nyourself  that  you  contrive  to  sail  between  Scylla \nand  Chary bdis  ;  whilst  you  would  be  understood \nto  have  asserted  nothing,  yet  again  assume  the \nair  of  an  asserter.  With  men  of  this  sort  how  is \nit  possible  to  confer  and  to  compare;6  unless  one \nshould  possess  the  art  of  catching  Proteus  ?  Here- \nafter I  will  shew  you  with  Christ's  help  what  I  can \ndo  in  this  way,  and  what  you  have  gained  by  put- \nting me  to  it. \n\nStill  it  is  not  without  reason  that  I  answer  you \nnow.  The  faithful  brethren  in  Christ  impel  me \nby  suggesting  the  general  expectation  which  is \nentertained  of  a  reply  from  my  pen ;  inasmuch  as \nthe  authority  of  Erasmus  is  not  to  be  despised, \nand  the  true  christian  doctrine  is  brought  into \njeopardy  in  the  hearts  of  many.  At  length  too  it \nhas  occurred  to  me  that  there  has  been  a  great \nwant  of  piety  in  my  silence ;  and  that  I  have  been \nbeguiled  by  the  '  wisdom5  or  c  wickedness5  of  my \nflesh  into  a  forgetfulness  of  my  office,  which  makes \nme  debtor  to  the  wise  and  to  the  unwise,  especially \nwhen  I  am  called  to  the  discharge  of  it  by  the  en- \ntreaties of  so  many  of  the  brethren.

What  if  some  have  not  yet \nexperienced  the  teaching  of  the  Spirit  through  my \nwritings,  and  have  been  dashed  to  the  ground  by \nyour  Diatribe !  It  may  be  their  hour  was  not  yet \ncome. \n\nAnd  who  knows  Jbut  God  may  deign  to  visit \neven  you,  my  excellent  Erasmus,  by  so  wretched \nand  frail  a  little  vessel  of  His,  as  myself?  Who \nknows  but  I  may  come  to  you  in  happy  hour  (I \nwish  it  from  my  heart  of  the  Father  of  Mercies \nthrough  Christ  our  Lord)  by  means  of  this  trea- \ntise, and  may  gain  a  most  dear  brother?  For, \nalthough  you  both  think  ill  and  write  ill  on  the \nsubject  of  Freewill,  I  owe  you  vast  obligations, \nfor  having  greatly  confirmed  me  in  my  sentiments, \nby  giving  me  to  see  the  cause  of  Freewill  pleaded \nby  such  and  so  great  a  genius,  with  all  his  might, \nand  yet  after  all  so  little  effected,  that  it  stands \nworse  than  it  did  before. — An  evident  proof  this, \nthat  Freewill  is  a  downright  lie ;  since,  like  the \nwoman  in  the  Gospel,  the  more  it  is  healed  of \nthe  doctors  the  worse  it  fares.  I  shall  give  un- \nbounded thanks  to  you,  if  the  event  be,  that  you \nare  made  to  know  the  truth  through  me,  even  as  I \nhave  become  more  fixed  in  it  through  you,  How- \nbeit,  each  of  these  results  is  the  gift  of  the  Spirit, \nnot  the  achievement  of  our  own  good  offices.2 \n\ns  Officii  nostri.']  Off.  f  What  a  man  has  to  do  j*  '  his  business/ \nimplying  relation ;  as  fmunus  et  officium  oculorum/  e  the  office \nor  function  of  the  eye/  Hence, '  good  office,  obligation,  kind- \nness conferred.' \n\n\nINTRODUCTION.  9 \n\nWe  must  therefore  pray  God  to  open  my  mouth \nand  your  heart  and  the  hearts  of  all  men,  and  to \nbe  himself  present  as  a  Teacher  in  the  midst  of \nus,  speaking  and  hearing  severally  within  our \nsouls.

For   it  is   not  the   property   of  a  sect.  i. \n\nchristian  mind  to  be  displeased  with  assertions;  ' \n\nnay,  a  man  must  absolutely  be  pleased  with  asser-  ^sfsei\"f  °dns \ntions,  or  he  never  will  be  a  Christian.

Again ;  I  con- \nfine '  assertion '  to  those  things  which  have  been \ndelivered  by  God  to  us  in  the  sacred  writings. \nWe  do  not  want  Erasmus,  or  any  other  Master, \nto  teach  us  that  in  doubtful  matters,  or  in  matters \nunprofitable  and  unnecessary,  assertions  are  not \nonly  foolish  but  even  impious ;  those  very  strifes \nand  contentions,  which  Paul  more  than  once  con- \ndemns. Nor  do  you  speak  of  these,  I  suppose, \nin  this  place  ;  unless,  either  adopting  the  manner \nof  a  ridiculous  Orator,  you  have  chosen  to  pre- \nsume one  subject  of  debate  and  discuss  another, \nlike  him  who  harangued  the  Rhombus;  or,  with \nthe  madness  of  an  impious  Writer,  are  contend- \ning that  the  article  of  Freewill  is  dubious  or \nunnecessary. d \n\nc  Ne  verbis  ludamur.']  {  That  we  may  not  be  mocked  by \nwords  {  e  made  the  sport  of  words.' \n\nd  Velut  ilk  ad  Rhombum.']  If  you  be  indeed  speaking  of  such \nassertions  here,  you  are  either  a  ridiculous  orator,  or  a  mad \nwriter  :  a  ridiculous  orator,  if  it  be  not  true  genuine  Freewill \nwhich  you  are  discussing  ;  a  mad  writer,  if  it  be.  Oratory  was \nout  of  place,  on  such  a  subject,  however  sincere  and  dis- \ninterested the  speaker  might  be ;  but  orators  were  for  the \nmost  part  a  venal  and  frivolous  tribe,  and  some  exercised  their \nart  unskilfully,  whilst  others  were  hired  but  to  amuse  and  make \nsport.  It  is  not  without  meaning,  therefore,  that  Luther  puts \nthe  orator  and  the  writer  into  comparison  ;  and  if  Erasmus  is \nto  fill  the  weightier  place  of  the  writer,  it  is  that  of  one \nphrensied  and  blasphemous. — I  am  indebted  to  the  kindness  of \na  learned  friend  for  the  reference,  c  velut  ille  ad  Rhombum,' \nwhich  had  perplexed  me.  I  can  have  no  doubt  that  it  is  to \nthe  fourth  Satire  of  Juvenal,,  where  Domitian  is  represented  as \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL; \n\nWe  Christians  disclaim  all  intercourse  with  the \nSceptics  and  Academics,  but  admit  into  our  family \nasserters  twofold  more  obstinate,  than  even  the \nStoics  themselves.     How  often  does  the  Apostle \n\nhaving  called  a  council  of  his  senators  to  deliberate  what \nshould  be  done  with  an  immense  '  Rhombus,'  or  Turbot ;  with \nwhich  a  fisherman  out  of  fear  had  presented  him.  Amongst \nother  counsellors  was  a  blind  man,  of  very  infamous  character, \nas  an  informer,  but  high  in  the  favour  of  the  Emperor,  named \nCatullus  ;  '  cum  mortifero  Catuilo.' \n\n\"  Grande  et  conspicuum  nostro  quoque  tempore  monstrum \n\"  Ccecus  adulator.\" \n\nThis  man  extolled  the  Rhombus  exceedingly,  pointing  to  its \nvarious  beauties  with  his  hand,  as  if  he  really  saw  them.  Rut \nunfortunately,  whilst  he  pointed  to  the  fish  as  lying  on  his  left \nhand,  it  lay  all  the  while  on  his  right. \n\n\"  Nemo  magis  Rhombum  stupuit  :  nam  plurima  dixit \n\"  In  laevum  conversus  :  at  illi  dextra  jacebat \n\"  Bellua : \n\nThis  was  not  the  only  occasion  on  which  he  had  given  scope \nto  his  imagination,  and  praised  as  though  he  had  eyes  : \n\n\"sic  pugnas  Cilicis  laudabat  et  ictus, \n\n\"  Et  pegma,  et  pueros  inde  ad  velaria  raptos.\" — Juv.  iv.  113 — 121. \n\nThe  force  of  the  comparison,  therefore,  lies  in  Erasmus \nbeing  supposed  to  discuss  the  phantom  of  his  own  imagination, \ninstead  of  the  real  Rhombus.  This  phantom  he  might  call \ndubious  or  unnecessary,  without  being  himself  impious  j  it  was \nthe  coinage  of  his  own  brain  :  but  if  he  called  the  real \nRhombus,  '  the  Church's  confession  of  Freewill,'  dubious  or \nuseless,  he  wrote  gravely,  but  he  wrote  sacrilegiously.  He  has \nonly  the  alternative,  therefore,  of  being  a  fool  or  a  madman, \nif  he  place  Luther's  assertion  on  Freewill  amongst  the  barren \nand  vain. — The  word  '  praesumere '  is  used  in  rather  a  peculiar,' \nbut  not  unauthorized,  sense  ;  correspondent  with  our  English \nword,  '  presume,'  and  with  its  own  etymology  j  c  preconceive,' \n'anticipate,'  (  conjecture,'  imagine,' — '  opinari,'  '  credere,' \n(  conjicere,'  c  imaginari.' — I  should  rather  have  preferred  un- \nderstanding ( praesumere'  in  the  sense  of ' anticipating $'  mean- \ning that  he  spoke  of  one  subject  here  in  his  Preface,  and  of \nanother  in  the  body  of  his  work.  But  the  illustration  does  not \ncoincide  with  this  view  3  Catullus  did  not  make  two  speeches  : \nnor  do  I  find  any  authority  for  such  use  of  { praesumere.'— It \nhas  a  peculiar  rhetorical  sense  of  '  pre-occupying  ;'  that  is, \ng  occupying  the  adversary's  ground  before  him,'  by  an- \nticipating and  obviating  his  objections. — But  this  will  not \napply  here. \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  13 \n\nPaul  demand  that  Plerophory,e  or  most  assured    sect.

Unless  this  be  not \nasserting,  to  die  for  confessing  and  asserting !  In \nshort,  the  Spirit  is  such  an  assertor,  that  He  even \ngoes  out  as  a  champion  to  invade  the  world,  and \nreproves  it  of  sin,  as  though  he  would  provoke  it \nto  the  fight;  and  Paul  commands  Timothy  to \n\"  rebuke,  and  to  be  instant  out  of  season.\"  (John \nxvi.  8.  2  Tim.  iv.  2.)  But  what  a  droll  sort  of \nrebuke r  would  he  be,  who  neither  assuredly  be- \nlieves, nor  with  constancy  asserts  himself,  the \ntruth  which  he  rebukes  others  for  rejecting.

This  were  nothing  else  but  a  denial  of  all \nreligion  and  piety  at  once ;  or  an  assertion,  that \nneither  religion,  nor  piety,  nor  any  dogma  of  the \nfaith,  is  of  the  least  moment. — And  why,  pray,  do \nyou  also  deal  in  assertions  ?     '  I  am  not  pleased \n\ne  Luther  has  no  authority  for  this  interpretation  of  the  terra \nPlerophory ;  which  expresses  no  more  than  '  full  evidence  to  a \nfact,  or  truth  ;'  or,  '  full  assurance  of  that  fact  or  truth.'

For \nwhat  is  more  wretched  than  uncertainty  ? \n\nAgain;  what  shall  we  say  to  the  words  subjoin- \ned, '  to  which  I  in  all  things  willingly  submit  my \njudgment,  whether  I  understand  what  they  pre- \nscribe, or  not'?  What  is  this  you  say,  Erasmus  ? \nIs  it  not  enough  to  have  submitted  your  judgment \nto  Scripture?  do  you  submit  it  also  to  the  decrees \nof  the  Church?  What  has  she  power  to  decree, \nwhich  the  Scripture  has  not  decreed  ?  If  so,  what \nbecomes  of  liberty,  and  of  the  power  of  judging \nthose  dogmatists  :  as  Paul  writes  in  1  Cor.  xiv. \n\"  Let  the  others  judge?\"  You  do  not  like,  it  seems, \nthat  there  should  be  a  judge  set  over  the  decrees  of \nthe  Church;  but  Paul  enjoins  it.  What  is  this \nnew  devotedness  and  humility  of  yours,  that  you \ntake  away  from  us  (as  far  as  your  example  goes) \nthe  power  of  judging  the  decrees  of  men,  and \nsubmit  yourself  to  men,  blindfold?  Where  does \nthe  divine  Scripture  impose  this  on  us?  Then \nagain,  what  Christian  would  so  commit  the  in- \njunctions of  Scripture  and  of  the  Church  to  the \nwinds,  as  to  say  *  whether  I  apprehend;  or  do  not \n\n\n16  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  i.   apprehend/     You  submit  yourself,  and  yet  do  not \n\ncare  whether  you  apprehend  what  you  profess,  or \n\nnot.  But  a  Christian  is  accursed,  if  he  do  not \napprehend,  with  assurance,  the  things  enjoined  to \nhim.  Indeed,  how  shall  he  believe  if  he  do  not  ap- \nprehend ?  For  you  call  it  apprehending  here,  if  a \nman  assuredly  receives  an  affirmation,  and  does \nnot,  like  a  Sceptic,  doubt  it.  Else,  what  is  there \nthat  any  man  can  apprehend  in  any  creature,  if  '  to \napprehend  a  thing '  be  ' perfectly  to  know  and \ndiscern  it'?  Besides,  there  would  then  be  no \nplace  for  a  man's  at  the  same  time  apprehending \nsome  things,  and  not  apprehending  some  things,  in \nthe  same  substance ;  but  if  he  have  apprehended \none  thing,  he  must  have  apprehended  all :  as  in \nGod,  for  instance ;  whom  we  must  apprehend,  be- \nfore we  can  apprehend  any  part  of  his  creation. \n\nIn  short,  these  expressions  of  yours  come  to  this : \nthat,  in  your  view,  it  is  no  matter  what  any  man \nbelieves  any  where,  if  but  the  peace  of  the  world \nbe  preserved ;  and  that,  when  a  man's  life,  fame, \nproperty  and  good  favour  are  in  danger,  he  may \nbe  allowed  to  imitate  the  fellow  who  said  'They \naffirm,  I  affirm ;  they  deny,  I  deny;'  and  to  account \nchristian  doctrines  nothing  better  than  the  opi- \nnions of  philosophers  and  ordinary  men,  for  which \nit  is  most  foolish  to  wrangle,  contend  and  assert, \nbecause  nothing  but  contention  and  a  disturbing  of \nthe  peace  of  the  world  results  therefrom.

I  have \nsaid  thus  much  to  deter  you  from  hereafter  loading \nour  cause  with  charges  of  positiveness  and  inflexi- \nbility ;  for,  upon  this  plan,  you  only  shew  that  you \nare  nourishing  in  your  heart  a  Lucian,  or  some \nother  hog  of  the  Epicurean  sty,  who,  having  no  be- \nlief at  all  of  a  God  himself,  laughs  in  his  sleeve  at \nall  those  who  believe  and  confess  one.  Allow  us \nto  be  asserters,  to  be  studious  of  assertions,  and \nto  be  delighted  with  them  ;  but  thou,  meanwhile, \nbestow  thy  favour  upon  thy  Sceptics  and  Acade- \nmics, till  Christ  shall  have  called  even  thee  also. \nThe  Holy  Ghost  is  no  Sceptic ;  nor  has  He  written \ndubious  propositions,  or  mere  opinions,  upon  our \nhearts,  but  assertions  more  assured  and  more  firmly \nrooted  than  life  itself,  and  all  that  we  have  learned \nfrom  experience.11 \n\nI   come    to  another   head,  which  is  of  a  piece  Christian \nwith  this.     When  you  distinguish  between  chris-  truthjs  re; \n\n. .  ,  i        n  ^i     9  vealed  and \n\ntian  dogmas,  you  pretend  that  some  are  necessary  ascertain- \nto  be  known,  and  some  unnecessary;  you  say  that  ed,nothid- \nsome  are  shut  up,  and  some  exposed  to  view.1 \nThus,  you  either  mock  us  with  the  words  of  others, \nwhich  have  been  imposed  upon  yourself,  or  try \nyour  hand  at  a  sort  of  rhetorical  sally  of  your  own. \nYou  adduce,  in  support  of  your  sentiment,  that  say- \ning of  Paul's  (Rom.  xi.  33.)  \"  O  the  depth  of  the \nriches  both  of  the  wisdom  and  knowledge  of  God  ?' \n\nwith  what  face  could  the  Pope  or  the  Princes  prefer  an  Infidel  ? \nSee  Milner's  Eccles.

It  was  easy  for  you  to  say  these \nthings,  either  as  one  who  knew  that  he  was  not \nwriting  to  Luther,  but  for  the  multitude;  or  as  one \nwho  did  not  consider  that  he  was  writing  against \nLuther:  to  whom  you  still  give  credit,  as  I  hope,  for \nsome  study  and  discernment  in  the  Scriptures. \nIf  not,  see  whether  I  do  not  even  extort  it  from \nyou.  If  I  also  may  be  allowed  to  play  the  rheto- \nrician, or  logician,  for  a  moment,  I  would  make \nthis  distinction  :  God,  and  the  writing  of  God, \nare  two  things ;  no  less  than  the  Creator,  and  the \ncreature  of  God,  are  two  things.  Now,  that  there \nbe  many  things  hidden  in  God,  which  we  are  igno- \nrant of,  no  one  doubts;  as  he  speaks  himself  of  the \nlast  day,  u  Of  that  day  knoweth  no  man,  but  the \nFather.\"  (Matt.  xxiv.  36.)  And  again,  in  Acts  i. \n\"It  is  not  for  you  to  know  the  times  and  the \nseasons.\"  And  again;  \"I  know  whom  I  have \nchosen.\"* (John  xiii.  18.)  And  Paul  says,  \"The \nLord  knoweth  them  that  are  His\"  :  (2  Tim.  li.  19.) \nand  the  like.  But  that  some  dogmas  of  Scripture \nare  shut  up  ki  the  dark,  and  all  are  not  exposed  to \nview,  has  been  rumoured,  it  is  true,  by  profane \nSophists  (with  whose  mouth  you  also  speak  here, \nErasmus),  but  they  have  never  produced  a  single  in- \nstance, nor  can  they  produce  one,  by  way  of  making \ngood  this  mad  assertion  of  theirs.  Yet,  by  such \nhobgoblins  as  these,  Satan  has  deterred  men  from \nreading  the  sacred  writings;  and  has  rendered \nholy  Scripture  contemptible,  that  he  might  cause \nhis  own  pestilent  heresies,  derived  from  philoso- \nphy,   to  reign  in  the  Church.    I    confess    indeed \n\nk  Luther  appears  to  understand  this  text  as  most  do  :  '  He \nknew  who  those  were  amongst  men,  whom  he  had  chosen ;' \nwith  a  supposed  reference  to  eternal  election.

For  what,  that  is  of  a  edden\"othid' \nmore  august  nature,    can  yet  remain  concealed  in \nScripture,  now  that,  after  the  breaking  of  the  seals, \nand  rolling  away  of  the  stone  from  the  door  of  the \nsepulchre,  that  greatest  of  all  mysteries  has  been \nspread  abroad,  that  '  Christ,  the  Son  of  God,  is \nmade  man';1  that  ' God  is  at  the  same  time  Three \nand   One;'  that  c Christ  has  suffered  for  us,  and \nshall   reign  for  ever  and  ever'?     Are  not  these \nthings  known,  and  even  sung  in  the  streets  ?  Take \nChrist  from  the  Scriptures,  and  what  will  you  any \nlonger  find  in  them  ? \n\nThe  things  contained  in  the  Scriptures,  then, \nare  all  brought  forth  into  view,  though  some  pas- \nsages still  remain  obscure,  through  our  not  under- \nstanding the  words.  But  it  is  foolish  and  pro- \nfane to  know  that  all  the  truths  of  Scripture  are \nset  out  to  view  in  the  clearest  light,  and,  because \na  few  words  are  obscure,  to  call  the  truths  them- \nselves obscure.  If  the  words  be  obscure  in  one \nplace,  they  are  plain  in  another;  and  the  same  truth, \ndeclared  most  openly  to  the  whole  world,  is  both \nannounced  in  the  Scriptures  by  clear  words,  and \nleft  latent  by  means  of  obscure  ones.  But  of  what \nmoment  is  it,  if  the  truth  itself  be  in  the  light,  that \nsome  one  testimony  to  it  be  yet  in  the  dark ;  when \nmany  other  testimonies  to  the  same  truth,  mean- \nwhile, are  in  the  light  ?

For  Christ  hath \nopened  our  understanding,  that  we  should  un- \nderstand the  Scriptures.  (Luke  xxiv.  45.)  And \nthe  Gospel  has  been  preached  to  every  creature. \n(Mark  xvi.  15.  Coloss.  i.  23.)  Their  sound \nhas  gone  out  into  all  the  land.  (Ps.  xix.  4.)  And \nall  things  which  have  been  written,  have  been \nwritten  for  our  learning.  (Rom.  xv.  4.)  Also, \nall  Scripture  having  been  written  by  inspiration  of \nGod,  is  useful  for  teaching.  (2  Tim.  iii.  16.) \nThou,  therefore,  and  all  thy  Sophists  come  and \nproduce  a  single  mystery  in  the  Scriptures,  which \nstill  remains  shut  up.  The  fact,  that  so  many  truths \nare  still  shut  up  to  many,  arises  not  from  any \nobscurity  in  the  Scriptures,  but  from  their  own \nblindness,  or  carelessness ;  which  is  such,  that \nthey  take  no  pains  to  discern  the  truth,  though \nit  be  most  evident.  As  Paul  says  of  the  Jews, \n(2  Cor.  iii.  15.)  \"The  veil  remains  upon  their \nheart/'  And  again,  (2  Cor.  iv.  3,  4.)  \"  If  our \nGospel  be  hid,  it  is  hid  to  them  that  are  lost ; \nwhose  hearts  the  God  of  this  world  hath  blinded.\" \nTo  blame  Scripture,  in  this  matter,  is  a  rashness \nlike  that  of  the  man  who  should  complain  of  the \nsun  and  of  the  darkness,  after  having  veiled  his \n\nm  Luther's  affirmation  and  argument  is  of  the  greatest  im- \nportance here.  All  the  truth  of  God,  he  maintains,  is  expli- \ncitly and  intelligibly  declared  in  Scripture  ;  in  some  passages \nmore  obscurely,  through  our  ignorance  of  words  ;  in  others \nmore  manifestly  and  unequivocally :  but  there  is  no  truth, \nno  dogma,  that  is  not  distinctly  taught  and  confirmed.  . \n\nn  A  cave  of  singular  virtue  in  Mount  Corycus  of  Cilicia, \nsupposed  to  be  inhabited  by  the  Gods. \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  21 \n\nown  eyes,  or  gone  from  but  of  the  day-light\" into   SEC.  iv. \n\na  dark   room  to   hide  himself.

Thus \nIsaiah  (Isai.  xl.  13.)  does  not  say  'who  hath \nknown  the  mind  of  Scripture/  but,  \"  who  hath \nknown  the  mind  of  the  Lord?\"  How7beit,  Paul \nasserts  that  the  mind  of  the  Lord  is  known  to \nChristians  :  but  then  it  is  about  u  those  things \nwhich  have  been  freely  given  to  us\";  as  he  speaks \nin  the  same  place.  (1  Cor.  ii.  10.  16.)  You  see, \ntherefore,  how  carelessly  you  have  inspected  these \npassages  of  Scripture;  which  you  have  cited,  about \nas  aptly  as  you  have  done  nearly  all  your  others \nin  support  of  Freewill.  And  thus,  your  instances, \nwhich  you  subjoin  with  a  good  deal  of  suspicion \nand  venom,  are  nothing  to  the  purpose ;  such  as \n6  the  distinction  of  Persons  in  the  Godhead/  '  the \ncombination  of  the  divine  and  human  nature,5  and \n6  the  unpardonable  sin:'  whose  ambiguity,  you  say, \nhas  not  even  yet  been  clean  removed.0  If  you \nallude  to  questions  which  the  Sophists  have \nagitated  on  these  subjects,  I  am  ready  to  ask  what \nthat  most  innocent  volume  of  Scripture  hath  done \nto  you,  that  you  should  charge  her  with  the  abuse, \nwrith  which  wicked  men  have  contaminated  her \npurity?  Scripture  simply  makes  confession  of \nthe  Trinity  of  Persons  in  God,  of  the  humanity  of \nChrist,  and  of  the  unpardonable  sin:  what  is  there \n\n0  Re$ectum.~\\  Erasmus's  term ;  taken  from  fthe  close  cutting  of \nthe  nails,  or  hair,  or  beard  ;'  or,  from  f  the  excision  of  the \nunsound  tiesh  in  wounds.'  It  implies,  that  all  the  ambiguity  is \nnot  yet  withdrawn,  though  some  of  it  may  be. \n\n\n22  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  I.  of  obscurity,  or  of  ambiguity  here  ?  How  these \n—  things  subsist,  the  Scripture  has  not  told  us,  as \nyou  pretend  it  has ;  nor  have  we  any  need  to  know. \nThe  Sophists  discuss  their  own  dreams  on  these  sub- \njects :  accuse  and  condemn  them,  if  you  please,  but \nacquit  Scripture.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  you \nspeak  of  the  essential  truth,  and  not  of  factitious \nquestions,  I  say  again,  do  not  accuse  Scripture, \nbut  the  Arians,  and  those  to  whom  the  Gospel  is \nhid,  to  such  a  degree,  that  they  have  no  eye  to  see \nthe  clearest  testimonies  in  support  of  the  Trinity \nof  Persons  in  God,  and  the  humanity  of  Christ; \nthrough  the  working  of  Satan,  who  is  their  God. \n\nTo  be  brief;  there  is  a  twofold  clearness  in \nScripture,  even  as  there  is  also  a  twofold  obscu- \nrity: the  one  external,  contained  in  the  ministerially \nof  the  word  ;  the  other  internal,  which  consists  in \nthat  knowledge  which  is  of  the  heart. p  If  you  speak \nof  this  internal  clearness,  no  one  discerns  an  iota \nof  Scripture,  but  he  who  has  the  Spirit  of  God.  All \nmen  have  a  darkened  heart :  so  that,  even  though \nthey  should  repeat  and  be  able  to  quote  every \npassage  of  Scripture,  they  neither  understand  nor \ntruly  know  any  thing  that  is  contained  in  these \npassages ;  nor  do  they  believe  that  there  is  a  God', \nor  that  they  are  themselves  God's  creatures,  or \nany  thing  else.  According  to  what  is  written \nin  Psalm  xiv.  ;  \"  The  fool  hath  said  in  his  heart, \nGod  is  nothing.\"  (Ps.  xiv.  1.)  For  the  Spirit \nis  necessary  to  the  understanding  of  the  whole \nof  Scripture,  and  of  any  part  of  it.  But  if  you \nspeak  of  that  external  clearness,  nothing  at  all \n\np  Luther  refers  back  to  this  passage  in  the  progress  of  his \nwork.  (See  below,  Chap.  ii.  Sect,  xiii.)  It  is  not  the  public \nministry  of  the  word,  but  its  instrumentality  in  general,  of \nwhich  he  here  speaks.  Scripture  reveals  truth  to  the  ear,  and \nreveals  truth  to  the  heart.  The  former  of  these  he  calls  an \nexternal  clearness.  The  word  which  falls  upon  the  ear  is  a  plain \nand  clear  word.  The  other  he  calls  an  internal  clearness.  The \ntruth  which  is  contained  in  Scripture,  and  conveyed  by  a  clear \nand  plain  word,,  is  understanded  by  the  heart* \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  23 \n\nhas  been  left  obscure,  or  ambiguous ;  but  every  sect.  v. \n\nthing  that  is  contained  in  the  Scriptures  has  been  . \n\ndrawn  out  into  the  most  assured  light,  and  de- \nclared to  the  whole  world,  by  the  ministeriality  of \nthe  word. \n\nBut  it  is  still  more  intolerable,  that  you  Freewill  a \nshould  class  this  question  of  Freewill  with  those  necessary \nwhich  are  useless  and  unnecessary,  and  should  su  ject* \nrecount  a  number  of  articles  to  us  in  its  stead,  the \nreception  of  which  you  deem  sufficient  to  con- \nstitute a  pious  Christian.

It  is  most  necessary  and  most  salutary,  then, \nfor  a  Christian  to  know  this  also  ;  that  God  fore- \nGod's  fore-  knows  nothing  contingently,  but  foresees,  and  pur- \n\nknowledge  i  i*    i  ii  •  ■• \n\nabsolute,  poses,  and  accomplishes  every  thing,  by  an  un- \nflows  from  changeable,  eternal,  and  infallible  will.  But,  by \n2J2S£  this  thunderbolt,  Freewill  is  struck  to  the  earth  and \ncompletely  ground  to  powder.  Those  who  would \nassert  Freewill,  therefore,  must  either  deny,  or \ndisguise,  or,  by  some  other  means,  repel  this  thun- \nderbolt from  them.  However,  before  I  establish  it \nby  my  own  argumentation  and  the  authority  of \nScripture,  I  will  first  of  all  encounter  you  per- \nsonally, with  your  own  words.  Are  not  you  that \nErasmus,  who  just  now  asserted,  that  it  is  God's  na- \nture to  be  just,  that  it  is  God's  nature  to  be  most \nmerciful  ?  If  this  be  true,  does  it  not  follow,  that \nhe  is  unchangeably  just  and  merciful;  that,  as \nhis  nature  changes  not  unto  eternity,  so  neither \ndoth  his  justice  or  his  mercy  change  ?  But \nwhat  is  said  of  his  justice  and  mercy,  must  he \nsaid  also  of  his  knowledge,  wisdom,  goodness, \nwill,  and  other  divine  properties.  If  these  things, \nthen,  be  asserted  religiously,  piously,  and  profit- \nably concerning  God,  as  you  write  ;  what  has \nhappened  to  you,  that,  in  disagreement  with  your- \nself, you  now  assert  it  to  be  irreligious,  curious, \nand  vain,  to  affirm  that  God  foreknows  necessarily? \nIs  it  that  you  think,  that,  c  he  either  foreknows \nwhat  he  does  not  will,  or  wills  what  he  does  not \nforeknow  ?'  If  he  wills  what  he  foreknows,  his \nwill  is  eternal  and  immutable,  for  it  is  part  of  his \nnature  :  if  he  foreknows  what  he  wills,  his  know- \nare  the  powers  of  this  faculty,  which  is  thus  supposed  and  main- \ntained by  you  to  be  free.'  This  is  just  the  crux  of  modern  Free- \nwillers,  as  it  was  of  Erasmus.  They  get  on  pretty  well,  till \nthey  are  compelled  to  define. \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  33 \n\nledge  is  eternal  and  immutable,  for  it  is  part  of  bis  sect.  x. \n\nnature.1  \n\nHence  it  irresistibly  follows,  that  all  which  we \ndo,  and  all  which  happens,  although  it  seem  to \nhappen  mutably  and  contingently,  does  in  reality \nhappen  necessarily  and  unalterably,  insofar  as \nrespects  the  will  of  God.  For  the  will  of  God  is \nefficacious,  and  such  as  cannot  be  thwarted  ;  since \nthe  power  of  God  is  itself  a  part  of  his  nature  :  it \nis  also  wise,  so  that  it  cannot  be  misled.  And \nsince  his  will  is  not  thwarted,  the  work  which \nhe  wills  cannot  be  prevented ;  but  must  be  pro- \nduced in  the  very  place,  time,  and  measure  which \nhe  himself  both  foresees  and  wills.  If  the  will  of \nGod  were  such  as  to  cease  after  he  has  made  a \nwork  which  remains  the  same,  as  is  the  case  with \nman's  will  when,  after  having  builded  a  house  as \nhe  willed,  his  will  concerning  it  ceases ;  as  it \ndoes  in  death ;  then  it  might  be  truly  said,  that \nsome  events  are  brought  to  pass  contingently  and \nmutably.  But  here,  on  the  contrary,  so  far  is  it \nfrom  being  the  case,  that  the  work  itself  either \ncomes  into  existence,  or  continues  in  existence \ncontingently,  by  being  made  and  remaining  in \nbeing  when  the  will  to  have  it  so  hath  ceased ; \nthat  the  work  itself  ceases,  but  the  will  remains. \nNow,  if  we  would  use  words  so  as  not  to  abuse \nthem,  a  work  is  said  in  Latin  to  be  done  contin- \ngently, but  is  never  said  to  be  itself  contingent. \n\nfThis  abstruse  but  irresistible  deduction  from  Erasmus's \nconcession  may  perhaps  be  stated  a  little  more  familiarly,  thus: \nIf  God  does  not  foreknow  all  events  absolutely,  there  must  be \na  defect  either  in  his  will,  or  in  his  knowledge  ;  what  happens \nmust  either  be  against  his  will,  or  beside  his  knowledge.  Either \nhe  meant  otherwise  than  the  event,  or  had  no  meaning  at  all \nabout  the  event ;  or,  he  foresaw  another  event,  or  did  not \nforesee  any  event  at  all.  But  the  truth  is,  what  he  willed  in \npast  eternity,  he  wills  now  ;  the  thing  now  executed  is  what \nhe  has  intended  to  execute  from  everlasting  ;  for  his  will  is \neternal :  just  as  the  thing  which  has  now  happened  is  what  he \nsaw  in  past  eternity  ;  because  his  knowledge  is  eternal. \n\nD \n\n\n34 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

Besides,  a  work  cannot  be  called  a  con- \ntingent one,  except  it  be  done  by  us  contingently \nand  as  it  were  by  accident,  without  any  fore- \nthought on  our  part ;  being  so  called,  because  our \nwill  or  hand  seizes  hold  of  it  as  a  thing  thrown  in \nour  way  by  accident,  and  we  have  neither  thought \nnor  willed  any  thing  about  it  before. \n\n#  I  could  have  wished  indeed,  that  another  and  a \nbetter  word  had  been  introduced  into  our  dis- \nputation than  this  usual  one,  c Necessity';  which \nis  not  rightly  applied  to  the  will  of  either  God  or \nman.  It  has  too  harsh  and  incongruous  a  mean- \ning for  this  occasion;  suggesting  the  notion  of \nsomething  like  compulsion,  and  what  is  at  least \nthe  opposite  of  willingness,  to  the  mind.  Our \nquestion,  meanwhile,  implies  no  such  thing;  for \nboth  God's  will,  and  man's  will  does  what  it  does, \nwhether  good  or  bad,  without  compulsion,  by  dint \nof  mere  good  pleasure  or  desire,  as  with  perfect \nfreedom.  The  will  of  God,  nevertheless,  is  im- \nmutable and  infallible,  and  governs  our  mutable \nwill — as  Boethius  sings,  '  and  standing  fixed, \nmov'st  all  the  rest' — and  our  will,  wicked  in  the \nextreme,  can  of  itself  do  nothing  good.  Let  the \nunderstanding  of  my  reader,  then,  supply  what  the \nword  c necessity'  does  not  express;  apprehending \nby  it,  what  you  might  choose  to  call  the  immutability \nof  God's  will,  and  the  impotency  of  our  evil  will : \nwhat  some  have  called  '  a  necessity  of  immuta- \nbility': not  very  grammatically  or  theologically. \n\nThe  Sophists,  who  had  laboured  this  point  for \nyears,  have  at  length  been  mastered,  and  are  com- \npelled to  admit  that  *  all  events  are  necessary ;' \nbut  by  the  necessity  of  a  consequence,  as  they  say, \nand  not  by  the  necessity  of  a  consequent.  Thus \nhave  they  eluded  the  violence  of  this  question,  but \n\n*  N.  B.

By  necessity  of  a \nconsequence  (to  speak  as  these  thick-headed  people \ndo)  they  mean,  that,  if  God  wills  a  thing,  the  thing \nitself  must  be,  but  it  is  not  necessary  that  the  very \nthing  which  is,  should  be.  For  only  God  exists  neces- \nsarily;  all  other  things  may  cease  to  be,  if  God \npleases.  Thus  they  say  that  the  act  of  God  is  neces- \nsary, if  he  wills  a  thing,  but  that  the  very  thing  pro- \nduced is  not  necessary.  Now  what  do  they  get  by \nthis  play  upon  words  ?  Why,  this,  I  suppose.  The \nthing  produced  is  not  necessary;  that  is,  has  not \na  necessary  existence — this  is  no  more  than  say- \ning, the  thing  produced  is  not  God  himself.  Still \nthe  truth  remains,  that  every  event  is  necessary ; \nif  it  be  a  necessary  act  of  God,  or  a  necessary \nconsequence  :  however  it  may  not,  now  that  it  is \neffected,  exist  necessarily;  that  is,  may  not  be \nGod,  or  may  not  have  a  necessary  existence.  For, \nif  I  am  of  necessity  made,  it  is  of  little  moment  to \nme  that  my  being  or  making  be  mutable.  Still \nI — this  contingent  and  mutable  thing,  who  am  not \nthe  necessary  God — am  made.  So  that  their \nfoolery,  that  all  events  are  necessary,  through  a \nnecessity  of  the  consequence,  but  not  through  a \nnecessity  of  the  consequent,  has  no  more  in  it  than \nthis :  all  events  are  necessary,  it  is  true  ;  but \nthough  necessary,  are  not  God  himself.  Now \nwhat  need  was  there  to  tell  us  this  ?

It  is  this  poet's  sole  object  to  shew,  that \nin  the  destruction  of  Troy  and  the  raising  up  of \nthe  Roman  empire  from  its  ruins,  fate  did  more \nthan  all  human  efforts  put  together.  In  short,  he \nsubjects  his  immortal  Gods  to  fate;  making  even \nJupiter  himself  and  Juno  to  yield  to  it  necessarily. \nHence  they  feigned  these  three  fatal  sisters,  the \nParcse;  whom  they  represent  as  immutable,  im- \nplacable, inexorable. \n\nThose  wise  men  discovered  (what  fact  and  ex- \nperience prove)  that  no  man  has  ever  yet  received \nthe  accomplishment  of  his  own  counsels,  but  all \nhave  had  to  meet  events  which  differed  from  their \nexpectations.

So  that,  in  the  minds  of \n\nthe  common  people,  the  knowledge  of  the  predes- \ntination and  foreknowledge  of  God  is  not  less  in- \nherent, we  perceive,  than  the  very  notion  that \nthere  is  a  God  :  although  blessed  Augustine,  with \ngood  reason,  condemns  fate  ;  speaking  of  the  fate \nwhich  is  maintained  by  the  Stoics.  But  those \nwho  professed  to  be  wise  went  to  such  lengths  in \ntheir  disputations,  that,  at  last,  their  heart  being \ndarkened  they  became  foolish,  (Rom.  i.  22.)  and \ndenied  or  dissembled  those  things  which  the  poets, \nand  the  vulgar,  and  their  own  consciences,  account \nmost  common,  most  certain,  and  most  true. \n\nI  go  further,  and  declare,  not  only  how  true  these  The  ex- \nthings  are  (of  which  I  shall  hereafter  speak  more  meritygand \nat  large  from  the  Scriptures)  but  also  how  reli-  mischiev- \n2fious,  pious,  and  necessary  it  is  to  know  them.  °usness  °f \nFor  if  these  things  be  not  known,  it  is  impossible  pretended \nthat  either  faith  or  any  worship  of  God  should  be  and  boast- \nmaintained.     For  this  would  be  a  real  ignorance  \\™  eia\" \nof  God;  with  which  salvation  cannot  consist;  as \nis   notorious.    For  if  you  either  doubt  this  truth, \nor  despise  the  knowledge  of  it,  that  God  fore- \nknows and  wills  all  things  ;  not  contingently,  but \nnecessarily    and    immutably ;   how  will    you   be \nable  to  believe  his  promises,  and  with  full  as- \nsurance to  trust  and  lean  upon  them  ?     For,  when \nhe  promises,  you  ought  to  be  sure  that  he  knows \nwhat  he  promises,  and  is  able  and  willing  to  ac- \ncomplish it  :  else   you  will  account  him  neither \ntrue  nor  faithful ;  which  is  unbelief,  the  highest \nimpiety,  and  a  denial  of  the  most  high  God. \n\nBut  how  will  you  be  confident  and  secure,  if  you \ndo  not  know  that  he  certainly,  infallibly,  un- \nchangeably, and  necessarily  knows  and  wills,  and \nwill  perform  what  he  promises  ?

And \nagain,  \"  Not  that  the  word  of  God  hath  been  of \nnone  effect.\"  (Rom.  ix.  6.)

For  this \nis  the  alone  and  highest  possible  consolation  of \nChristians,  in  all  adversities,  to  know  that  God \ndoes  not  lie,  but  brings  all  things  to  pass  without \nany  possibility  of  change ;  and  that  his  will  can \nneither  be  resisted,  nor  altered,  nor  hindered.

May  the  Lord  pardon \nand  have  mercy  on  you  ! \n\nAs  to  the  fact,  that  the  Sophists  have  raised  such \nswarms  of  questions  on  these  subjects,  and  have \nmixed  a  multitude  of  other  unprofitable  matters \nwith  them,  such  as  you  mention ;  I  am  aware  of \nthis,  and  acknowledge  it  as  well  as  you,  and  have \ninveighed  against  it  with  yet  more  sharpness, \nand  at  greater  length,  than  you.  But  you  are \nfoolish  and  rash  in  mixing,  confounding,  and  assi- \nmilating the  purity  of  sacred  truth  with  the  pro- \nfane and  foolish  questions  of  ungodly  men.  They \nhave  defiled  the  gold  and  changed  its  beautiful \ncolour,  as  Jeremiah  says,  (Lam.  v.  1.)  but  gold  is \nnot  forthwith  to  be  compared  to  dung  and  thrown \naway  together  with  it ;  as  you  have  done.  The \ngold  must  be  recovered  out  of  their  hands,  and \n\nsoned  arrows  of  Luther's  treatise  ;  c  a  hireling  expectant,  with \nonly  half  his  heart  in  the  cause.' \n\nk  A  forced  application  of  James's  words  ;  who  speaks  of  a \nbreach  of  one  commandment  as  subjecting  us  to  the  curse  of \nall,  because  such  breach  is  derogatory  to  the  authority  of  the \nLawgiver.  We  set  ourselves  up  against  the  Lawgiver,  and \nimpugn  his  authority  by  a  single  wilful  breach  of  a  single  com- \nmandment, with  guilt  of  the  same  quality,  though  not  of  the \nsame  extent  and  aggravation,  as  if  we  brake  all.  Luther  ap- \nplies it  to  Erasmus's  only  meaning  to  have  a  little  sport ;  but \nthen  it  is  at  the  expense  of  Scripture  :  and  such  sport,  and  even \nthe  intention  of  such  sport,  implies  a  want  of  due  reverence \nfor  Scripture.  This  first  fault  leads  to  all  the  impiety  which \nfollows  ;  and  therefore  he  who  is  guilty  of  it,  is  guilty  of  all \nthe  impieties  which  follow,  though  he  did  not  set  out  with  the \nintention  of  committing  them.

Nor  should  it  move  us,  that  no \nother  advantage  has  been  gained  by  these  ques- \ntions, than  that,  with  great  expense  of  concord, \nwe  have  come  to  love  less,  whilst  we  are  far  too \neager  to  get  wisdom.  It  is  not  our  question,  what \nadvantage  disputatious  Sophists  have  gained ;  but \nhow  we  may  ourselves  become  good  Christians : \nnor  ought  you  to  impute  to  christian  doctrine  what \nungodly  men  do  amiss.  For  this  is  nothing  to  the \npurpose,  and  you  might  have  spoken  of  it  in  ano- \nther place,  and  have  spared  your  paper. \n\nIn  your  third  chapter,  you  go  on  to  make  us  ah  Scrlp- \nthese  modest  and  quiet  Epicureans  by  another  turet™ih \nsort  of  counsel,  not  a  whit  sounder  than  the  two  published \nalready  mentioned  :  viz.  that  '  some  propositions  safely- \nare  of  such  a  nature,  that  even  though  they  were \ntrue  and  could  be  ascertained,  still  it  would  not  be \nexpedient  to  publish  them  promiscuously.'1  Here \nagain,  you  confound  and  mix  things,  as  your  cus- \ntom is,  that  you  may  degrade  what  is  sacred  to \nthe  level  of  the  profane,  without  allowing  the  least \ndifference  between  them ;  and  again  fall  into  an \ninjurious  contempt  of  God  and  his  word.  I  have \nsaid  before,  what  is  either  plainly  declared  in \nScripture,  or  may  be  proved  from  it,  is  not  only \nopen  to  view,  but  salutary ;  and  therefore  may  be \nwith  safety  published,  learned,  and  known;  nay, \nought  to  be  so.  With  what  truth,  then,  can  you \nsay,  that  there  are  things  which  ought  not  to  be \npublished  promiscuously,  if  you  speak  of  things \ncontained  in  Scripture  ?  If  you  speak  of  other \nthings,  nothing  that  you  have  said  concerns  us ; \nall  is  out  of  place,  and  you  have  wasted   your \n\n1  Prostituere  promiscnis  auribus.~\\  Prostit.

Again,  you  know \nthat  I  have  no  agreement,  upon  any  subject,  with \nthe  Sophists;  so  that  I  deserved  to  have  been \nspared  by  you,  and  not  to  have  had  their  abuses \ncast  in  my  teeth.  It  was  against  me  that  you \nwere  to  write  in  this  book.  I  know  how  guilty  the \nSophists  are,  and  don't  want  you  to  teach  me, \nhaving  already  reprehended  them  abundantly  : \nand  this  I  say,  once  for  all,  as  often  as  you  con- \nfound me  with  the  Sophists,  and  load  my  cause \nwith  their  mad  sayings.  You  act  unfairly  by  me \nin  so  doing,  and  you  very  well  know  it. \n\nLet  us  now  look  into  the  reasons  on  which  you \nbuild  your  counsel.  Though  it  should  be  true, \nthat  God  is  essentially  present  in  the  beetle's \ncave,  and  even  in  the  common  sewer,  no  less  than \nin  heaven  (which  reverence  forbids  you  to  assert \nand  you  blame  the  Sophists  for  babbling  so) ; \nstill,  you  think  it  would  be  irrational  to  maintain \nsuch  a  proposition  before  the  multitude. \n\nIn  the  first  place,  babble  who  may,  we  are  not  talk- \ning here  about  the  actions  of  men,  but  about  law  and \nright ;  not  how  we  live,  but  how  we  ought  to  live ! \nWhich  of  us  lives  and  acts  rightly  in  all  cases? \nLaw  and  precept  are  not  condemned  on  this  ac- \ncount, but  rather  we  by  them.  The  truth  is,  you \nfetch  these  materials  of  yours,  which  are  foreign \nto  the  subject,  from  a  great  distance,  and  scrape \nmany  things  together  from  all  sides  of  you,  be- \ncause this  one  topic  of  the  foreknowledge  of  God \ngravels  you ;  and,  having  no  arguments  to  over- \ncome it  with,  you  try  to  weary  your  reader  by  a \nprofusion  of  empty  words,  before  you  conclude. \nBut  we  will  let  this  pass,  and  return  to  our  subject. \n— Then  how  do  you  mean  to  apply  this  judgment \nof  yours,  that  there  are  some  truths  which  ought \nnot  to  be  proclaimed  to  the  vulgar  ?  Is  Freewill \none  of  these  ?  If  so,  all  that  I  said  before,  about \nthe  necessity  of  understanding  Freewill,  returns \nupon  you.     Besides,  why  do  you  not  follow  your \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  43 \n\nown  counsel,  and  withhold  your  Diatribe?   If  you  sec.xvl \n\nare  right  in  discussing  Freewill,  why  do  you  find \n\nfault?  if  it  be  wrong  to  so  do,  why  do  you  discuss \nit  ?  On  the  other  hand,  if  Freewill  be  not  one  of \nthese  subjects,  you  are  again  guilty  of  running \naway  from  the  point  at  issue,  in  the  midst  of  the \ndiscussion,  and  of  handling  foreign  topics  with  great \nverbosity,  where  there  is  no  place  for  them. \n\nNot  that  you  deal  correctly  with  the  example  Erasmus's \nwhich  you  adduce,  when  you  condemn  it  as  an  amplest \nuseless  discussion  for  the  multitude,  '  that  God  is  truths  not; \nin  the  cave,  or  in  the  sewer/  You  think  of  God  r01*>edpub\"- \ntoo  humanly.  I  acknowledge,  indeed,  that  there  sidere'd. \nare  some  frivolous  preachers,  who,  having  neither \nreligion  nor  piety,  and  being  moved  solely  by  a \ndesire  of  glory,  or  an  ambition  of  novelty,  or  an \nimpatience  of  silence,  gabble  and  trifle  with  the \nmost  offensive  levity.  But  these  men  please  nei- \nther God  nor  man,  though  they  be  engaged  in \nasserting  that  God  is  in  the  heaven  of  heavens. \nOn  the  contrary,  where  the  preacher  is  grave  and \npious,  and  teaches  in  modest,  pure,  and  sound \nwords ;  such  a  man  will  declare  such  a  truth  be- \nfore the  multitude,  not  only  without  danger,  but \neven  with  great  profit.  Ought  we  not  all  to  teach \nthat  the  Son  of  God  was  in  the  womb  of  the \nVirgin,  and  born  from  her  bowels  ?  And  what \ndifference  is  there  between  the  bowels  of  a  wo- \nman and  any  other  filthy  place  ?  Who  could  not \ndescribe  them  nastily  and  offensively?  Yet  we \nshould  deservedly  condemn  such  clescribers,  be- \ncause there  is  an  abundance  of  pure  words  to  ex- \npress this  substance,  of  which  it  has  become  ne- \ncessary to  speak,m  with  beauty  and  grace.  Christ's \nown  body,  again,  was  human  like  our  own.  And \nwhat  is  filthier  than  this  ?

Paul   speaks?n  (Coloss.  ii.   9.)     What  is   more \n\ndisgusting  than  death  ?    What  more  horrible  than \n\nhell?     But  the  Prophet  glories  that  God  is  with \nhim  in  death  and  in  hell.  (Psa.  xxiii.) \n\nThe  pious  mind  then  does  not  shudder  to  hear \nthat  God  is  in  death  or  in  hell;  each  of  which  is \nmore  horrible  than  the  cave  or  the  sewer :  nay, \nsince  Scripture  testifies  that  God  is  every  where, \nand  fills  all  things,  not  only  does  such  a  mind \naffirm  that  he  is  in  those  places,  but  will,  as \nmatter  of  necessity,  learn  and  know  that  he  is \nthere.  Unless,  perchance,  if  I  should  somehow \nbe  seized  by  a  tyrant,  and  cast  into  a  prison  or  a \ncommon  sewer,  which  has  been  the  lot  of  many \nsaints,  I  must  not  be  allowed  to  invoke  my  God \nthere ;  or  to  believe  that  he  is  present  with  me, \nuntil  I  shall  have  come  into  some  ornamented \ntemple  !  If  you  teach  us  that  we  ought  to  trifle \nin  this  way  about  God,  and  are  so  offended  with \nthe  abiding  places  of  his  essence,  you  will,  at \nlength,  not  allow  us  to  consider  him  as  abiding \neven  in  heaven :  for  not  even  the  heaven  of  hea- \nvens contains  him,  or  is  worthy  to  do  so.  But \nthe  truth  is,  you  sting  with  so  much  venom,0  as \nyour  manner  is,  that  you  may  sink  our  cause,  and \nmake  it  hateful,  because  you  see  it  to  be  insuper- \nable and  invincible,  by  powers  such  as  yours. \n\nThe  second  instance  which  you  adduce,  6  that \nthere  are  three  Gods/  is,  I  confess,  a  stumbling- \nblock,  if  it  be  indeed  taught :  nor  is  it  true,  nor \ndoes  Scripture  teach  it.  The  Sophists,  indeed, \nspeak  so  ;  and  have  invented  a  new  sort  of  logic. \nBut  what  is  that  to  us  ? \n\nn  I  would  crave  the  reader's  particular  attention  to  this  de- \nscription of  the  human  body  of  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  j  that  part \nof  his  frame  which  alone  connected  him  and  did  really  con- \nnect him  with  the  damned  substance  of  his  people.  It  enters \ninto  the  very  entrails  of  '  the  mystery  of  godliness.' \n\n°  Sic  odiose  pungis.']  Pung.

So,  bidding  adieu, \nfor  a  little  while,  to  conscience  and  to  God,  (for \nwhat  has  Erasmus  to  do  with  the  will  of  the  latter \nand  the  obligations  of  the  former,  in  these  mat- \nters?) you  draw  your  sword  upon  a  mere  out- \nside phantom,  and  accuse  the  common  people  of \nabusing  the  preaching  of  free  confession  and \nsatisfaction,9  as  their  own  evil  nature  may  incline \nthem,  to  the  indulgence  of  the  flesh;  maintaining, \nthat  by  necessary  confession  they  are,  some  how \nor  other,  restrained.  O  famous  and  exquisite \nharangue  !  Is  this  teaching  theology  ?  To  bind \nwith  laws  and  kill,  as  Ezekiel  says,  (xxiii. \nxiii.  19.)  the  souls  which  God  has  not  bound.  At \nthis  rate,  you  stir  up  the  whole  tyranny  of  the \nPopish  laws  against  us  forsooth,  on  the  ground \nof  their  being  useful  and  salutary ;  because  by \nthem  also  the  wickedness  of  the  people  is  re- \nstrained ! \n\nBut  I  am  unwilling  to  inveigh  against  you,  as \nthis  passage  deserves.  I  will  state  the  matter  as \nit  is,  concisely.

For  the  conscience  is \nbound  only  by  the  commands  of  God;  so  that \nthis  interposed  tyranny  of  the  pontiffs,  which \nfalsely  terrifies  and  kills  souls  inwardly,  whilst  it, \nto  no  purpose,  harasses  the  body  without,  should \nbe  entirely  taken  out  of  the  way.  This  tyranny \ndoes,  indeed,  compel  men  to  outward  acts  of  con- \nfession, and  to  other  burdens,  but  the  mind  is  not \nrestrained  by  these  things :  rather,  it  is  exaspe- \nrated to  an  hatred  of  God  and  of  man.  It  hangs, \ndraws,  and  quarters  the  body  outwardly,  without \neffect,  making  mere  hypocrites  within ;  insomuch, \nthat  the  tyrants  who  enact  and  execute  laws  of \nthis  sort  are  nothing  else  but  rapacious  wolves, \nthieves,  and  robbers  of  souls.  These  wolves  and \nrobbers,  O  most  excellent  counsellor  of  souls,  thou \ncommendest  to  us  again.  In  other  words,  thou \nproposest  the  most  cruel  of  soul-slayers  to  our \nacceptance;  who  will  fill  the  world  with  hypo- \ncrites, blaspheming  God,  and  despising  him  in \ntheir  hearts  ;  in  order  that  men  may  be  a  little \nrestrained  in  their  outward  carriage  :  as  if  there \nwere  not  another  method  of  restraining,  which \nmakes  no  hypocrites,  and  is  obtained  without  de- \nstroying any  man's  conscience ; r  as  I  have  said, \nsc.  xvn.

You  plainly  intimate,  therefore, \nthat  this  peace  and  tranquillity  of  the  flesh  is  far \nmore  excellent  in  your  eyes  than  faith,  conscience, \nsalvation,  the  word  of  God,  the  glory  of  Christ, \nyea,  God  himself.  I  declare  to  you,  therefore, \nand  entreat  you  to  lay  this  up  in  your  inmost \nsoul,  that  I,  for  my  part,  am  in  pursuit  of  a  se- \nrious, necessary,  and  eternal  object  in  this  cause  ; \nsuch  and  so  great  an  object,  that  I  must  assert  and \ndefend  it,  even  at  the  hazard  of  my  life ;  nay, \nthough  the  whole  world  must  not  only  be  thrown \ninto  a  state  of  conflict  and  confusion  through  it, \nbut  even  rush  back  again  into  its  original  chaos, \nand  be  reduced  to  nothing.  If  you  do  not  com- \nprehend, or  do  not  feel,  these  things,  mind  your \nown  business;  and  give  others  leave  to  compre- \nhend and  to  feel  them,  on  whom  God  has  be- \nstowed this  power. \n\nFor  I  am  not  such  a  fool,  or  such  a  madman,  I \nthank  God,  as  to  have  been  willing  to  plead  and \nmaintain  this  cause  so  long,  with  such  resolute- \nness, with  such  constancy,  (you  call  it  obstinacy) \n\n\n48  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  i.    amidst  so  many  hair-breadth   escapes  with    life, \n\namidst  so  many  enmities,  amidst  so  many  wiles \n\nand  snares — in  short,  amidst  the  rage  and \nphrenzy  of  men  and  devils ;  for  the  sake  of  money, \nwhich  I  neither  have  nor  desire ;  or  for  the  sake \nof  glory,  which,  if  I  would,  I  could  not  obtain  in \na  world  that  is  so  hostile  to  me ;  or  for  the  sake  of \nbodily  life,  of  which  I  cannot  ensure  the  possession \nfor  a  single  moment.

The \nLord  grant  that  your  mind  be  not  such  (I  hope \nand  wish  he  may  !)  but  your  words  sound  as \nthough,  like  Epicurus,  you  accounted  the  word  of \nGod  and  a  future  state  to  be  mere  fables ;  when, \nby  virtue  of  the  doctorial  authority  with  which \nyou  are  invested,  you  wish  to  propose  to  us,  that, \nin  order  to  please  pontiffs  and  princes,  or  to  pre- \nserve this  dear  peace  of  yours,  we  should  submit \nourselves,  and,  for  a  while,  relinquish  the  use  of \nthe  word  of  God,  sure  as  that  word  is,u  if  occasion \nrequire  ;  although,  by  such  relinquishment,  we  re- \nlinquish God,  faith,  salvation,  and  every  christian \npossession.

See,  in  the  Acts  of  the  Apos- \ntles, what  happens  in  the  world  through  Paul's \npreaching  only,  not  to  mention  the  other  Apos- \ntles ;  how  he  singly  and  alone  stirs  up  both  Gen- \ntiles and  Jews :  or,  as  his  enemies  themselves \naffirm  in  that  same  place,  how  he  troubles v  the \nwhole  world.  The  kingdom  of  Israel  is  troubled \nunder  the  ministry  of  Elijah,  as  king  Ahab  com- \nplains.

It  is  the \n\npart  of  a  Christian,  now-a-days,  to  await  and \nendure  these  things  with  presence  of  mind;  as \nChrist  says,  u  When  ye  shall  hear  of  wars  and \nrumours  of  wars,  be  not  afraid,  for  these  things \nmust  first  be,  but  the  end  is  not  just  yet.\"  I,  for \nmy  part,  should  say,  if  I  saw  not  these  tumults, \nthe  word  of  God  is  not  in  the  world  :  but  seeing \nthem,  I  rejoice  in  my  heart  and  despise  them ; \nmost  sure,  that  the  kingdom  of  the  Pope  and  his \nadherents  is  about  to  fall :  for  the  word  of  God, \nwhich  is  now  running  in  the  world,  has  especially \ninvaded  this  kingdom.  To  be  sure,  I  see  you, \nmy  Erasmus,  complaining  of  these  tumults  in \nmany  of  your  publications,  and  mourning  over \nthe  loss  of  peace  and  concord.  Moreover,  you \ntry  many  expedients  to  cure  this  disorder,  with  a \ngood  intention,  as  I  verily  believe ;  but  this  is  a \nsort  of  gout,  which  mocks  your  healing  hands. \nFor  here,  to  use  your  own  expression,  you  are,  in \ntruth,  sailing  against  the  stream;  nay,  you  are \nextinguishing  fire  with  stubble.  Cease  to  com- \nplain, cease  to  play  the  physician:  this  confusion \nis  of  God  in  its  origin,  and  in  its  progress ;  nor \nwill  it  cease,  till  it  has  made  all  the  adversaries  of \nthe  word  like  the  mire  of  the  streets.  But  it  is  a \nlamentable  thing,  that  it  should  be  necessary  to \nadmonish  you,  who  are  so  great  a  theologian,  of \nthese  things,  as  a  scholar ;  when  you  ought  to  be \nfilling  the  place  of  a  master. \n\nThis,  then,  is  the  proper  application  of  your \naphorism  (a  very  excellent  one  though  you  mis- \napply it),  '  that  some  diseases  are  borne  with \nless  evil  than  removed/  Let  all  those  tumults, \ncommotions,  troubles,  seditions,  divisions,  dis- \ncords, wars,  and  whatsoever  other  things  there \nare  of  like  kind,  with  which,  for  the  word  of \nGod's  sake,  the  whole  world  is  shaken  and  clashed \ntogether  in  conflict;   be  called   diseases  better \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  51 \n\nborne   than   cured.

For  what  com- \nparison is  there  between  temporal  and  eternal \nthings  ?  Much  rather,  then,  is  this  leprosy  of \ntemporal  evils  to  be  borne,  than  that,  at  the  ex- \npense of  the  slaughter  and  eternal  damnation  of \nall  the  souls  in  the  world,  the  world  should,  by \ntheir  blood  and  destruction,  be  pacified  and  cured \nof  all  these  tumults :  since  one  soul  cannot  be \nredeemed  by  paying  the  whole  world  for  its  ran- \nsom.

Many  books  of  ours  are \nbefore  the  public  upon  these  questions. \n\n6  Still,  however,  the  laws  of  the  pontiffs  ought  to \nbe  suffered,  and  to  be  observed  equally  with  the  di- \nvine laws,  out  of  love,  if  both  the  eternal  salvation \nof  men,  through  the  word  of  God,  and  the  peace  of \nthe  world,  may  thus  be  made  to  subsist  together \nwithout  tumult/ \n\nI  have  said  before  that  this  cannot  be.  The \nprince  of  this  world  does  not  suffer  that  the  laws \nof  his  Pope  and  his  cardinals  be  maintained  in \nconsistency  with  liberty,  but  has  it  in  his  mind  to \nentrap  and  enchain  -men's  consciences  by  them. \nThe  true  God  cannot  endure  this.

Nor  are  these  per- \nsons of  so  great  account,  that  the  word  of  God \nshould  be  given  up  in  order  to  restrain  their \nabuse  of  it.  If  all  cannot  be  saved,  still  some  are \nsaved ;  for  whose  sake  the  word  of  God  is  given : \nand  these  will  love  it  the  more  fervently,  and  con- \nsent to  it  the  more  reverently.  And  what  evils, \npray,  have  wicked  men  not  done  even  before  this, \nwhen  there  was  no  word  of  God;  rather,  what \ngood  did  they?  Has  not  the  world  for  ever  over- \nflowed with  war,  fraud,  violence,  discord,  and  all \nmanner  of  wickedness,  so  that  Micah  compares \nthe  very  best  amongst  them  to  a  thorn?  (Micah \nvii.  4.)  What  would  he  call  the  rest,  think  you  ? \nNow,  indeed,  it  begins  to  be  imputed  to  the  pro- \nmulgation of  the  Gospel,  that  the  world  is  wicked; \nbecause  through  the  good  Gospel  it  more  truly \nappears  how  wicked  the  world  was,  whilst  it  lived \nin  its  own  darkness,  without  the  Gospel.  So,  illite- \nrate men  attribute  it  to  literature,  that  their  igno- \nrance has  become  notorious  since  letters  have \nflourished.  Such  are  the  thanks  we  render  to  the \nword  of  life  and  salvation !

How  contrary  is  it,  then,  to  the  clear \ntestimony  of  the  word,  which  declares  that  God  mocks  all \nhuman  distinctions ;  that  Jew  and  Greek,  master  and  servant, \nor  slave,  rulers  and  subjects,  pillars  of  the  church,  and  men \ndisinterested  in  the  church,  are  alike  regarded  and  disregarded \nby  Him ;  to  have  respect  to  these  distinctions,  as  Erasmus \nwould  counsel  us,  in  the  ministry  of  the  word  !  These  testi- \nmonies are  sometimes  perverted  to  mean  a  denial  of  God's \nelecting  grace;  which  they  do  not,  in  the  slightest  degree,  im- \npugn, nor  did  Luther  conceive  so.  He  maintained  that  grace \nas  firmly  as  any  man.  The  truth  is,  e  respect  of  persons'  in \nScripture,  means  e  respect  of  persons  according  to  human  and \nearthly  distinctions  ;  in  which  regards,  God,  contrariwise  to \nman,  puts  no  difference  between  them.  His  distinctions,  which \nhe  palpably  makes,  are  built  upon  another  foundation.  \"  Where \nthere  is  neither  Greek  nor  Jew,  circumcision  nor  uncircum- \nsion,  barbarian,  Scythian,  bond  nor  free ;  but  Christ  is  all,  and \nin  all.\"  (Coloss.  iii.  11.)  But  then,  \"  Blessed  be  the  God  and \nFather  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  hath  blessed  us  with  all \nspiritual  blessings  (or  blessedness)  in  heavenly  places  in  Christ ; \naccording  as  He  hath  chosen  us  in  Him  before  the  foundation  of  the \nworld,\"  &c.

But  you  choose  to  play  \n\nthe  rhetorician  after  this  manner,  with  idle  words, \nbecause  you  must  say  something. \n\nHow  much  better  were  it  for  us  wretched  men \nto  give  to  God,  who  knows  all  hearts,  the  glory \nof  prescribing  the  manner,  persons,  and  times  of \nspeaking  the  truth  !  He  knows  the  c  what',  the \n'  when',  the  '  how',  and  the  '  to  whom',  we  ought \nto  speak ;  and  his  injunction  is,  that  his  Gospel, \nwhich  is  necessary  to  all,  should  know  no  limits  of \nplace  or  time,  but  should  be  preached  to  all  men, \nat  all  times,  and  in  all  places.  I  have  already \nshewn  that  the  things  set  forth  in  the  Scripture \nare  such  as  lie  exposed  to  the  view  of  all  men; \nsuch  as,  whether  we  will  or  no,  must  be  spread \nabroad  amongst  the  common  people ;  and  such  as \nare  salutary.  What  you  also  maintained  yourself \nin  your  Paraclesis,  when  you  gave  better  counsel \nthan  you  do  now.  Let  us  leave  it  to  those  who \nare  unwilling  that  souls  should  be  redeemed;  such \nas  the  Pope  and  his  myrmidons ;  to  bind  the  word \nof  God,  and  shut  men  out  from  eternal  life  and  the \nkingdom  of  heaven;  neither  entering  in  them- \nselves, nor  suffering  others  to  enter  in:  whose \nmad  rage  you,  Erasmus,  are  perniciously  serving \nby  this  suggestion  of  yours. \n\nWith  the  same  sort  of  wariness  you,  in  the  next  The  Fa- \nplace,  suggest  that  we  ought  not  to  make  public  ^e£s  no* \ndeclarations  in  opposition  to  any  thing  which  may  on  a  level \nhave  been  determined  wrongly  in  general  coun-  ^ith. \ncils;  lest  we  should  give  a  handle  for  despising  thelrteci- \nthe  authority  of  the  Fathers.  sions  have \n\nThis  you  say  to  please  the  Pope ;  who  hears  it  J^*^0\" \nwith  more  pleasure  than  he  does  the  Gospel :  un-  from  the \ngrateful  in  the  extreme,  if  he  does  not,  in  return,  word* \nhonour  you  with  a  cardinal's  hat  and  revenues ! \nMeanwhile,  what  is  to  become  of  those  souls  which \nhave  been  fettered  and  slain  by  the  unrighteous \ndecree?     Is  this  nothing  to  you?    Why,   you \n\n\n58 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n\npart  I.    always  feel,  or  pretend  to  feel,  that  the  statutes \n\nof  men  may  be  observed  without  any  danger;  in \n\ncoincidence  with  the  pure  word  of  God.  If  they \ncould,  I  would  readily  accord  with  this  propo- \nsition of  yours.  So  then,  if  you  be  still  ignorant, \nI  will  again  inform  you,  that  c  human  statutes \ncannot  be  observed  in  conjunction  with  the  word \nof  God/  For  the  former  bind  men's  consciences, \nthe  latter  looses  them ;  and  they  fight  one  with \nanother  like  fire  and  water,  except  the  former  be \nkept  freely;  that  is,  as  statutes  not  binding:  a \nthing  very  contrary  to  the  Pope's  will ;  and  which \nmust  be  so,  unless  he  should  wish  to  destroy  and \nput  an  end  to  his  own  kingdom ;  which  is  only \nkept  up  by  ensnaring  and  fettering  men's  consci- \nences, whilst  the  Gospel  declares  them  to  be  free. \nThe  authority  of  the  Fathers,  then,  must  be  set  at \nnought,  and  all  bad  decrees  (in  which  number  I \ninclude  all  such  determinations  as  are  not  war- \nranted by  the  word  of  God)  must  be  torn  in  pieces, \nand  thrown  to  the  dogs ;  for  Christ's  authority  is \nof  another  sort  than  that  of  the  Fathers.  In  short, \nif  your  statement  comprehends  the  word  of  God, \nit  is  a  wicked  one :  if  it  be  confined  to  other \nwritings,  your  verbose  discussion  of  the  sentiment \nwhich  you  recommend  is  nothing  to  me ;  my  as- \nsertions have  respect  to  the  word  of  God  only.1 \n\nIn  the  last  part  of  your  Preface,  you  seriously \ndissuade  us  from  this  sort  of  doctrine,  and  fancy \nthat  you  have  almost  succeeded.  What  is  more \ninjurious,  you  say,  than  that  this  paradox  should \nbe  published  to  the  world,  that  '  whatsoever  is \ndone  by  us  is  not  done  by  Freewill,  but  by  mere \n\n1  Erasmus  had  said,  that  bad  decisions  should  be  hushed  up  ; \nand  if  spoken  of,  it  should  rather  be  said,  that  they  were  good  at \nthe  time,  though  unseasonable  now.  Luther  replies,  if  your \nremark  be  intended  to  affect  any  decision  which  is  founded \nupon  the  word  of  God,  the  sentiment  is  impious.  With  res- \npect to  any  other  sort  of  decisions,  whether  you  choose  to  call \nthem  pious  and  holy,  or  acknowledge  them  to  be  faulty,  I  have \nnothing  to  do  with  them. \n\n\nSC.XXII. \n\nInjurious- \nness  of \ncertain  pa- \nradoxes, \n■  all  things \nby  neces- \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  59 \n\nnecessity '  ?

Who  will  strive  with  his  flesh  V \n\nI  am  surprised  that,  in  this  mighty  vehemence \nand  agony  of  yours,  you  did  not  remember  your \ncause,  and  say,  what  will  then  become  of  Freewill? \nLet  me  also  become  speaker  in  my  turn,  Erasmus, \nand  I  will  ask  you,  if  you  account  these  paradoxes \nto  be  the  invention  of  men,  why  dispute  ?  why \nboil  with  rage  ?  Whom  are  you  opposing  ?  Is \nthere  a  man  in  all  the  world,  at  this  day,  who  has \nmore  vehemently  inveighed  against  the  dogmas  of \nmen,  than  Luther  has  done  ?  So  that  this  admoni- \ntion of  yours  is  nothing  to  me.  But,  if  you  be- \nlieve these  paradoxes  to  be  the  word  of  God, \nwhat  face  have  you?k  what  modesty  have  you? \nWhere  is  now — I  will  not  say,  that  wonted  so- \nbriety of  Erasmus,  but — that  fearful  reverence \nwhich  is  due  to  the  true  God  ;  when  you  as- \nsert, that  nothing  can  be  affirmed  more  unpro- \nfitable- than  this  word  of  God  ?  What !  I  suppose \nyour  Creator  is  to  learn  from  his  creature  what  is \nuseful  to  be  preached,  and  what  not  ?  Yes, \nthis  foolish  and  ill-advised  God  has  not  known \nhitherto  what  is  expedient  to  be  taught;  but  now \nat  last  his  master  Erasmus  will  prescribe  to  him \nthe  manner  in  which  he  shall  be  wise,  and  in  which \nhe  shall  deliver  his  commands  !

If  God,   then,   hath   been  willing   to  have   such \n\nthings  spoken  openly,  and  spread  abroad  amongst \n\nthe  common  people,  without  regard  to  con- \nsequences ;  who  are  you,  that  you  should  forbid \nhim  ? \n\nPaul  the  Apostle  explicitly  declares  the  same \nthings,  in  his  Epistle  to  the  Romans,  open-mouthed, \nnot  in  a  corner,  but  publicly  and  before  the  whole \nworld,  in  even  harsher  words  ;  saying,  \"  Whom \nhe  will  he  hardeneth.\"  (Rom.  ix.  18.)  And  again, \n<c  God  willing  to  make  his  wrath  known.\"  (Rom.  ix. \n22.)  What  is  harsher  (to  the  flesh,  I  mean)  than \nthat  saying  of  Christ,  \"  Many  are  called,  but  few \nchosen.\"  (Matt.  xxii.  14.)  And  again,  \"I  know \nwhom  I  have  chosen.\"1  (John  xiii.  18.)  All  these \nsayings,  forsooth,  if  we  listen  to  your  suggestions, \nare  amongst  the  most  injurious  that  can  be  con- \nceived ;  inasmuch  as  they  are  the  instruments  by \nwhich  ungodly  men  fall  gradually m  into  despera- \ntion, hatred  of  God,  and  blasphemy. \n\nHere,  as  I  perceive,  you  reckon  that  the  truth \nand  usefulness  of  Scripture  are  to  be  weighed  and \ndecided  by  the  judgment  of  men,  and  these  no \nother  than  the  most  ungoldly  j  so  that,  what  they \nshall  be  pleased  with,  and  account  tolerable,  that, \nverily,  is  true,  is  divine,  is  salutary;  and,  what \nshall  be  otherwise  in  their  eyes,  that  is  straight- \nways  useless,  false,  and  pernicious.

You  clearly  shew  here,  my  Erasmus,  how \nsincere  you  was  before,  in  persuading  us  to  re- \nspect the  awful  majesty  of  the  divine  judgments. \nWhen  the  question  was  about  the  dogmas  of \nScripture,  and  there  was  no  need  to  call  for  reve- \nrence towards  them,  on  the  ground  of  their  beiog \nshut  up,  and  hidden  from  view;  inasmuch  as \nthere  are  none  of  this  sort ;  you,  in  words  of \ngreat  solemnity,  threatened  us  with  Corycian \ncaves,  lest  we  should  break  in  curiously:  so  as \nalmost  to  deter  us,  by  fear,  from  reading  Scrip- \nture at  all ;  that  very  Scripture  which  Christ  and \nhis  Apostles,  and  even  your  own  pen,  elsewhere, \nso  greatly  urge  and  persuade  us  to  study !  But, \nhere,  when  we  are  actually  arrived,  not  at  the \ndogmas  of  Scripture  and  the  Corycian  cave  only, \nbut  truly  at  the  awful  secrets  of  the  divine  ma- \njesty ;  to  wit,  why  he  works  in  the  manner  which \nhath  been  mentioned;  here,  I  say,  you  break \nthrough  bolts  and  bars,  and  rush  forwards,  with \nall  but  blasphemies  in  your  mouth ;  shewing  all \npossible  indignation  against  God,  because  you \nare  not  permitted  to  see  the  design  and  arrange- \nment of  such  a  judgment  of  his  !  n     Why  do  not \n\nn  Non  licet  videre.\"]  Referring  to  Augustine's  saying,  that \nf  God  worketh  all  things  in  us  ;  rewarding  his  own  good,  and \npunishing  his  own  evil.'

But  the  elect  and \ngodly  will  be  amended  by  the  Holy  Spirit :  the \nrest  will  perish  unamended.  For  Augustine  does \nnot  say  that  the  good  works  of  none  will  be \ncrowned,  nor  yet  that  the  good  works  of  all  will \nbe  crowned ;  but  that  the  good  works  of  some  are \ncrowned.  There  will  be  some,  therefore,  wrho \namend  their  life.  You  say,  'Who  will  believe \nthat  he  is  beloved  of  God?'  I  answer,  no  man \nwill  believe  so,  or  be  able  to  believe  so;  but  the \nelect  will  believe  so  :  the  rest,  not  believing,  will \nperish  ;  storming  and  blaspheming,  as  you  do  in \nthis  place.  There  will  be  some,  therefore,  that \nbelieve. \n\nAs  to  what  you  say,  c  that  a  window  is  opened \nto  impiety  by  these  doctrines ? — What  if  the  dis- \norders resulting  from  them  be  referred  to  that \nleprosy  of  tolerable  evil,  which  I  have  already \nhinted  at  ?  Still,  by  the  same  dogmas,  a  door  is \nat  the  same  time  opened  to  righteousness,  and  an \nentrance  into  heaven,  and  a  way  to  God,  for  the \n\n\nof  himself  to  our  view  j  which,  before  and  without  it,  was,  and \nmust  for  ever  have  remained,  concealed.

Now  if,  according  to  your  ad-  sc.xxin. \n\nvice,  we  should  abstain  from  these  dogmas,  and  \n\nshould  hide  this  word  of  God  from  men,  so  that \neach  one,  beguiled  by  a  false  persuasion  of  his \nsafety,  should  not  learn  to  fear  God,  and  to  be \nhumbled,  that,  through  the  means  of  wholesome \nfear,  he  may,  at  length,  come  to  grace  and  love ; \nthen,  we  shall  have  nobly  closed  your  window  of \nimpiety ;  but,  in  its  place,  we  shall  open  folding \ndoors ;  nay,  pits  and  gulfs  ;  not  only  to  impiety, \nbut  even  to  the  belly  of  hell;  for  ourselves  and \nfor  all  men.  Thus,  we  should  neither  enter \nheaven  ourselves,  nor  suffer  others,  who  were \nentering,  to  go  in. \n\n'What  is  the  use  or  necessity,  then,  of  publish- \ning such  things  to  the  world,  when  so  many  evils \nseem  to  spring  from  them  V \n\nI  answer  \\  it  were  enough  to  say,  tf  God  would \nhave  these  things  published  :  and,  as  to  the  prin- \nciples of  the  divine  will,  we  have  no  right  to  ask \nthem ;  we  ought  simply  to  adore  that  will,  giving \nglory  to  God ;  because  He,  the  only  just  and  wise \none,  injures  no  man,  and  cannot  possibly  do  any \nthing  foolishly  or  rashly ;  though  it  may  appear \nfar  otherwise  to  us/  Godly  men  are  content  with \nthis  answer.  But,  to  be  lavish  of  our  abundance,0 \nlet  it  be  replied,  that  c  two  things  require  the \npreaching  of  these  truths/  The  first  is,  the \nhumbling  of  our  pride,  and  a  thorough  knowledge \nof  the  grace  of  God  :  the  second,  the  very  nature \nof  christian  faith.  For  the  first,  God  hath  pro- \nmised his  grace,  with  certainty,  to  the  humbled ; \nthat  is,  to  those  who  bewail  themselves  in  self- \ndespair.

For,  as  long  as  he \nis  persuaded  that  he  can  do  the  least  thing  pos- \nsible for  his  own  salvation,  he  continues  in  self- \nconfidence,  and  does  not  absolutely  despair  of \nhimself;  therefore,  he  is  not  humbled  before  God, \nbut  goes  round  about  anticipating  for  himself,  or \nhoping,  or,  at  least,  wishing  to  obtain,  a  place,  a \ntime,  and  some  performance  of  his  own,  by  which \nHe  may  at  length  arrive  at  salvation.p  On  the \nother  hand,  he  who  has  not  the  shadow  of  a  doubt \nthat  he  is  dependent,  wholly  and  solely,  upon  the \nwill  of  God — this  man  is  complete  in  his  self- \ndespair  ;  this  man  chooses  nothing,q  but  waits  for \nGod  to  work  ;  this  man  is  next  neighbour  to  that \ngrace  of  God,  which  shall  make  him  whole.  So \nthat  these  things  are  published  for  the  elects' \nsake ;  that  they  may  by  these  means  be  humbled \nand  brought  to  know  their  own  nothingness; \nand  so  may  be  saved.  The  rest  resist  this  sort  of \nhumiliation;  nay,  they  condemn  the  teaching  of \nthis  self-despair  ;  they  would  have  some  very \nsmall  modicum  of  power  left  to  themselves.

This,  I  say,  is  one  reason \nwhy  these  truths  should  be  preached;  that  the \n\np  Quo  tandem  perveniat.']   The  contrast  is  between  that  direct  • \ngoing  to  God  of  the  truly  humbled  sinner ;  and  the  circuitous, \nprocrastinative,  self- centered  expectations  of  the  man  who  does \nnot  yet  know  the  whole  of  his  lostness  and  impotency. \n\ni  Nihil  eligitl]  In  direct  contrast  with  the  *  sibi  praesumit, \nsperat,  optat*  of  the  former  sentence  ;  he  does  not  desire  or  ex- \npect any  particular  combination  of  time  and  place,  in  which  he \nmay  perform  some  great  work  for  himself;  but  lies  passive  in \nthe  hands  of  God,  leaving  it  to  God  even  to  choose  for  him. \nThe  expression  reminds  us  of  St.  Paul's  language,  under  other \ncircumstances,  which  was  probably  in  Luther's  mind;  \"yet \nwhat  I  shall  choose  I  wot  not.\"  (Phil.  i.  22.) \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  65 \n\ngodly,  being  humbled,  may  come  to  a  real  know-  SC.XXin. \n\nledge1'  of  the  promise  of  grace,  may  call  upon  the  \n\nname  of  the  Lord,  and  may  receive  its  fulfilment. \n\nThe  second  reason  for  this  preaching  is,  that, \nfaith  being  conversant  about  things  which  do  not \nappear  ;  to  have  place  for  faith,  all  the  things \nbelieved  mast  be  hidden  things.  Now,  things \nare  never  hidden  further  from  us,  than  when  the \ncontrary  to  them  is  set  before  us  by  sense  and  ex- \nperience. Thus  God,  whilst  he  makes  us  alive, \ndoes  it  by  killing  us;  whilst  he  justifies  us,  does \nit  by  making  us  guilty ;  whilst  he  lifts  us  up  to \nheaven,  does  it  by  plunging  us  into  hell.  As  saith \nthe  Scripture,  \"  The  Lord  killeth,  and  maketh \nalive  ;  he  bringeth  down  to  the  grave,  and \nbringeth  up  :\"  (1  Sam.  ii.  6.)  of  which,  this  is  not \nthe  place  to  discourse  at  large.  Those,  who  have \nseen  our  books,  are  hackneyed  in  these  topics. \nThus  He  hides  his  eternal  mercy  and  pity  under \neternal  wrath  ;  his  righteousness  under  iniquity. \n\nThis  is  the  highest  degree  of  faith,  to  believe \nthat  He  is  merciful,  who  saves  so  few,  and  con- \ndemns so  many;  to  believe  Him  just,  who,  of  his \nown  will,  makes  us  necessary  objects  of  damna- \ntion ; s  thus  seeming,  according  to  Erasmus's  ac- \ncount, to  be  delighted  with  the  torments  of  the \nwretched,  and  to  deserve  hatred,  rather  than  love. \nIf  then,  I  could,  by  any  means,  comprehend  how \nthis  God  is  pitiful  and  just,  who  shews  so  great \nwrath  and  injustice,  there  would  be  no  need  of \nfaith ;  but  now,  since  this  cannot  be  compre- \nhended, space  is  given  for  the  exercise  of  faith, \nwhilst  these  things  are  preached  and  published ; \n\nr  Cognoscant.']  e  Nosco,  vel  bene  nosco ' ;  '  to  know  a  person, \nor  thing,  not  known  before  j'  opposed  to  '  agnosco.' \n\ns  Necessarib  damnabiles.~]  \"We  were  so  created,  have  been  so \ngenerated  and  brought  out  into  manifest  existence,,  are  so  con- \nstituted and  so  situated,  that  we  cannot  choose  but  be  just \nobjects  of  God's  eternal  damnation.

For,  if  you  either \nbelieve,  or  suspect  that  they  are  true  (being,  as \nthey  are,  paradoxes  of  no  small  moment),  through \nthat  insatiable  desire  which  men  have  for  scru- \ntinizing secret  things  (then,  most  of  all,  when \nmost  of  all  we  wish  to  conceal  them),  you  will \ncause  men  to  have  a  much  greater  desire  for \nlearning  whether  these  paradoxes  be  true,  by \npublishing  this  caution  of  yours ;  you  will  have \nset  them  on  fire,  no  doubt,  by  your  eagerness. \nThus  it  will  be  found,  that  none  of  us  has  ever \nyet  given  such  occasion  to  the  promulgation  of \nthese  things,  as  you  have  done  by  this  devout  and \nvehement  admonition.  You  would  have  acted \nmore  prudently,  in  quite  holding  your  tongue \nabout  shunning  these  paradoxes,  if  you  meant  to \nobtain  your  wish.

What  I  explained \nsay  at  present  is,  when  it  shall  have  been  shewn  and  de- \nthat  our  salvation  is  placed  beyond  the  reach  of  fended- \nour  own  power  and  wisdom,  depending  upon  the \nwork  of  God  only  (which  I  hope  to  prove  fully, \nhereafter,  in  the  body  of  my  discourse),  will  it  not \nclearly  follow,  that   'whilst  God  is   not  present \nas  a  worker  in  us,  every  thing  is  evil  which  we \ndo  ;  and  that  we  do  necessarily  those  things  which \nare  of  no  profit  to  our  own  salvation  V     For,  if \nit  is  not  we>  but  only  God,  that  works  salvation \nin  us;   we  do   nothing  that  is  profitable  to  our \nsalvation,  whether  we  will  or  no,  before  he  works \nin  us.     When  I  say  necessarily,  I  do  not  mean  by \ncompulsion ;  but,  as  it  is  said,  by  a  necessity  of \nimmutability,  not  of  compulsion :  that  is,  when  a \nman  is  destitute  of  the  Spirit  of  God,  he  does  not \nwork  evil  against  his  will,  through  a  violence  put \nupon  him;  as  if  some  one  should  seize  him  by  the \nthroat,  and  twist  him  round ;  just  as  a  thief  or \nhighwayman  is  carried,   against  his  will,  to  the \ngallows ;  but  he  works  it  of  his  own  accord,  and \nwith   a  willing   will.     But  then   he  cannot,    by \nhis    own   strength,  lay  aside,  restrain,  or  change \nthis  good  pleasure,  or  will  to  act ;  but.  he  goes  on \nwilling  and  liking :  and,  even  if  he  should  be  com- \npelled from  without  to  do  something  else  by  force, \nstill  his  will  remains  averse  within  him,  and  he  is \nangry  with  the  person  who  compels  or  resists  him. \n\nu  Suspicione  veritatis.']  Interdum  suspicio  est  '  opinio,'  '  co- \ngitatio,'  '  conjectural  f  levis  cognitio  :'  a  sort  of  i  surmise' \nthat  they  may  be  true. \n\nf2 \n\n\n68  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\nPART  I.  Now,  he  would  not  be  angry,  if  his  mind  were \nchanged,  and  he  were  following  the  force  which \nacts  upon  him  willingly.  This  is  what  I  at  pre- \nsent call  c  a  necessity  of  immutability ' ;  that  is, \nthe  will  cannot  change  itself  and  turn  another \nway,  but  is  rather  provoked  the  more  to  will,  by \nbeing  resisted :  as  is  proved  by  its  indignation. \nThis  would  not  be,  if  the  will  were  free,  or  pos- \nsessed Freewill.  Appeal  to  experience.  How \nimpracticable  those  persons  are,  who  cleave  to  any \nthing  with  affection.  If  these  persons  cease  to \ncleave,  they  so  cease  through  violence,  or  through \nthe  greater  advantage  which  they  are  to  derive \nfrom  something  else ;  they  never  cease  to  cleave, \nbut  by  constraint :  whereas,  if  they  have  no  affec- \ntion for  the  thing,  they  suffer,  what  may,  to  go  for- \nwards and  be  done. \n\nSo,  if,  on  the  other  hand,  God  work  in  us,  the \nwill  which  has  been  changed  and  softly  whispered \nto  by  the  Spirit  of  God,  again  wills  and  acts  ac- \ncording to  its  own  sheer  lust,  proneness,  and  self- \naccord,  not  compelledly;  so  that  it  cannot  be \nchanged  into  another  sort  of  will  by  any  opposite \nexcitements,  nor  overcome  or  compelled,  even  by \nthe  gates  of  hell ;  but  goes  on  willing  and  liking \nand  loving  good,  just  as  it  before  willed  and \nliked  and  loved  evil.  For,  experience  again \nproves,  how  invincible  and  constant  holy  men  are, \nwhilst  they  are  goaded  on  by  force  to  other  ob- \njects ;  insomuch,  that  they  are  from  thence  the \nmore  provoked  to  will  :  just  as  fire  is  inflamed,  by \nthe  wind,  rather  than  extinguished  !  So  that, \nneither  in  this  case  is  there  any  freedom  in  the \nwill  to  turn  itself  another  way,  or  will  some- \nthing else,  as  the  free  will  might  choose  ;  so \nlong  as  the  Spirit  and  God's  grace  remain  in  the \nman. \n\nIn  short,  if  we  be  under  the  power  of  the  G  od \nof  this  world,  being  destitute  of  the  work  and \nSpirit  of  the  true  God,  we  are  held  captive  by  him \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  69 \n\nat  his  will ;  as  Paul  says  (2  Tim.  ii.  26.) ;  so  that  sc.xxiv. \n\nwe  cannot  will  any  thing  but  what  he  wills.     For  \n\nhe  is  himself  that  strong  man  armed,  who  so \nkeepeth  his  palace  that  those  are  in  peace  whom \nhe  possesses ;  lest  they  should  stir  up  any  com- \nmotion or  thought  against  him.  Otherwise,  the \nkingdom  of  Satan,  being  divided  against  itself, \ncould  not  stand  ;  whereas  Christ  affirms  that  it \ndoes  stand.  And  this  will  of  his  we  do  willingly \nand  cordially,  agreeably  to  the  nature  of  our  will  ,* \nwhich,  if  it  were  compelled,  would  not  be  a  Will : \nfor  compulsion  is,  if  I  may  so  speak,  more  pro- \nperly Non-ivilL*  But,  if  a  stronger  than  he  come \nupon  him,  and,  having  conquered  him,  carry  us \noff' as  a  spoil;  then,  again,  we  become  servants \nand  captives  through  His  spirit  (which,  however, \nis  royal  liberty),  to  will  and  do  of  our  own  lust, \njust  what  He  himself  wills.  Thus,  the  human  will \nis  placed,  as  a  sort  of  packhorse,  in  the  midst  of \ntwo  contending  parties.  If  God  hath  mounted, \nit  wills  and  goes  whither  God  pleases;  as  the \nPsalmist  says,  \"  I  am  become  as  a  beast  of \nburden,  and  I  am  ever  with  thee.\"y  (Psa.  ixxiii. \n22,  23.)  If  Satan  hath  mounted,  it  wills  and  goes \nwhither  Satan  wills.  Nor  is  it  in  its  own  choice, \nto  which  of  the  two  riders  it  shall  run,  or  to  seek \nits  rider;  but  the  riders  themselves  contend  for  the \nacquisition  and  possession  of  it.z \n\nx  Xohuitas.']  '  The  negation  of  will;'  a  state  supposed, \nwhich  is  inconsistent  with  the  very  existence  of  the  faculty  : \nyet  this  is  what  the  opponents  of  '  necessity '  would  charge  its \nassertors  with  maintaining  ;  instead  of  that  constrained  but \nfreely-acted  obedience,  which  is  essential  to  the  reality  of  God's \nbeing  God,  and  man  his  moral  creature. \n\ny  Our  authorized  version  gives  another  turn  to  this  passage, \nby  dividing  the  verses  differently.

I  ask  and  de- \nmand, then,  if  the  grace  of  God  be  wanting,  or  be \n\n\nman's  will.  Hereafter,  it  will  be  found,  that  lie  firmly  and  ex- \nplicitly maintains  the  universal  and  minute  sovereignty  of  God, \nas  the  doer  of  all  things.  His  object  here  is  to  shew  the \ngovernance  under  which  man's  will  is  ;  that  it  is  under  the \npower  and  control  of  the  devil,  unless  and  until  the  Holy- \nGhost  assume  the  empire  of  it :  when  it  is  still  a  subject, \nthough  the  subject  of  another,  and  that  a  freedom-giving \nmaster. — The  truth,  however,  is,  that  God  has  never  given \nFreewill  (if  by  Freewill  is  meant  an  uncontrolled  will)  to  any \ncreature.  Man,  in  his  creation  state,  had  the  power  of  choos- \ning, and  refusing,  as  he  has  now  j  and  the  difference  between \nhis  then  state  and  his  now  state,  consisted  in  his  knowing  no- \nthing but  good  ;  and,  till  the  moment  of  trial,  having  no  temp- \ntation to  choose  any  thing  but  good.  When  that  temptation  was, \nfor  the  first  time,  presented  to  him,  we  know  how  he  met  it ;  and \nthe  result  was  a  corrupted  faculty,  which  Satan  rides  as  his \npackhorse.  But  both  his  seat  and  his  riding  are  of  the  gift, \nand  according  to  the  will,  of  God  ;  even  as  his  dispossession  is, \nwhen,  as  and  in  whom  God  wills ;  not  a  moment  sooner,  or \nlater.  Yet  all  this  agency  of  God  in  no  wise  contradicts  the \nreality  of  a  will  in  man ;  God's  universal  and  minute  govern- \nment consisting  in  his  setting,  or  rather  procuring  to  be  set, \nbefore  this  faculty,  such  considerations  as  shall  lead  the  free- \nagent  possessor  of  it  to  choose  just  what  God  would  have  him \nchoose. \n\na  Contra  me  turn  asserit,  turn  qucerit.']  Much  of  Erasmus's \nargument  consisted  of  dubitative  remark ;  hinting  a  fault  or \nobjection,  rather  than  boldly  stating  it  j  and  proposing  ques- \ntions, rather  than  affirming  certainties. \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  71 \n\nseparated   from  this   little  something  of  power;   sc.xxv. \n\nwhat  will  it  do  by  itself? b     It  is  inefficacious,  you  ' \n\nsay,  and  does  nothing  that  is  good.  Then  it  will \nnot  do  what  God  or  his  grace  would  have  to  be \ndone  (for  we  suppose  here,  that  the  grace  of  God \nis  in  a  state  of  separation  from  it),  and  what  the \ngrace  of  God  doeth  not,  is  not  good.  It  follows, \ntherefore,  that  the  free  wiil,c  without  the  grace  of \nGod,  is  absolutely  not  free,  but  is  immutably  the \ncaptive  and  slave  of  evil;  since  it  cannot,  of  itself, \nturn  to  good.  Let  but  this  be  allowed,  and  I  will \ngive  you  leave  to  make  the  power  of  the  free  will \nnot  only  that  small  something,  but  the  power  of \nan  angel ;  a  power,  if  you  can,  that  is  truly \ndivine.  Still,  if  you  shall  add  this  unhappy  ap- \npendage, that  it  is  inefficacious  without  the  grace \nof  God,  you  will  instantly  take  away  all  power \nfrom  it. — What  is  an  inefficacious  power,  but  no \npower  at  all  ? \n\nTo  say,  then,  that  the  will  is  free,  and  has \npower,  but  that  its  power  is  inefficacious,  is  what \nthe  Sophists  call  c  an  opposite  in  the  adjunct  f \nas  if  you  should  say,  the  will  is  free,  but  it  is  not \nfree.  It  is  like  saying,  fire  is  cold,  and  earth  is \nhot.  Let  fire  possess  even  an  infernal  degree  of \nheat;  if  it  be  neither  warm  nor  burn,  but  be  cold \nand  make  cold,  I  will  not  call  it  fire,  much  less \nhot — unless  you  choose  to  consider  it  as  a  paint- \ning or  engraving  of  a  fire.

For  we  also  confess  this  power  (that \nis,  this  fitness)  in  the  will ;  or,  as  the  Sophists \nspeak,  this  disposable  quality  and  passive  adapt- \nedness ;  which  everybody  knows  to  be  not  im- \nplanted in  the  trees  and  in  the  beasts :  for  God \nhath  not  created  heaven  for  geese  and  ganders ; \nas  it  is  said.d \n\nIt  stands  fixed,  even  by  your  own  testimony, \ntherefore,  that  we  do  all  things  by  necessity,  and \nnothing  by  Freewill;  so  long  as  the  power  of  the \nfree  will  is  nothing,  and  neither  does  nor  can  do \ngood,  in  the  absence  of  grace.

But  more  of \nthis  hereafter. \n\nIt  follows,  from  what  has  been  said,  that  Free- \nwill is  a  title  which  belongs  altogether  to  God; \nand  cannot  join  with  any  other  being,  save  the \nDivine  Majesty  only.  For  that  Divine  Majesty, \nas  the  Psalmist  sings,  can  and  does  effect  all  that \nHe  wills  in  heaven  and  in  earth.  (Psa.  cxxxv.  6.) \nBut  if  this  title  be  ascribed  to  men,  you  might  just \nas  well  ascribe  divinity  itself  to  them ;  a  sacrilege \nwhich  none  can  exceed.  So  that,  it  was  the  duty \nof  theologians  to  abstain  from  this  word,  when \n\nd  It  is  necessary  to  mark  with  precision  the  amount  of  this \nconcession.  Man  has  a  rational  will,  (not  that  his  reason  is \nseated  in  his  will ;  it  is  a  distinct  faculty  ;  and  we  should  say \nmore  correctly,  man  has  an  understanding  as  well  as  a  will) \nwhich  brutes  have  not ;  and  through  the  means  of  which  he \nmay  become  the  subject  of  spiritual  influences.  There  is  a \nspirit  in  man  ;  and  this  spirit  may  be  renewed  and  invigorated \nby  the  Holy  Ghost,  so  as  to  discern  spiritual  objects,  and  to \nperform  spiritual  acts.  But  how  does  this  affect  the  reality  of \nthe  natural  blindness  and  impotency  of  the  rational  will  ?  It \npresupposes  that  reality. \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PREFACE  REVIEWED.  73 \n\nthey  would  speak  of  human  power,  and  to  leave  it  sc.  xxv. \n\nfor  God  only;  and,  having  done  this,  to  remove  the  ' \n\nsame  from  out  of  the  mouth  and  discourse  of  men, \nclaiming;  it  as  a  sacred  and  venerable  title  for  their \nGod.e  Nay,  if  they  must  by  all  means  ascribe \nsome  power  to  man,  they  should  teach  that  it  be \ncalled  by  some  other  name  than  c Freewill;'  espe- \ncially, when  as  we  all  see  and  know,  the  common \npeople  are  miserably  seduced  and  beguiled  by \nthis  term ;  hearing  in  it,  and  conceiving  from  it, \na  something:  very  far  different  from  what  theolo- \ngians  entertain  in  their  minds,  and  affirm.  For \n' Freewill'  is  too  magnificent,  extensive,  and \ncopious  a  term;  by  which  the  common  people \nsuppose  (as  both  the  force  and  the  nature  of  the \nword  require)  that  a  power  is  meant,  which  can \nturn  itself  freely  to  either  side,  and  is  of  such  ex- \ntent as  not  to  yield  or  be  subjected  to  any  one. \nDid  they  know  that  the  fact  is  otherwise,  and \nthat  scarcely  a  very  small  particle  of  a  little  spark \nis  signified  by  it,  and  that  this  very  small  particle \nis  quite  inefficacious  by  itself;  nay,  the  captive \nand  slave  of  the  devil ;  it  would  be  strange  if  they \ndid  not  stone  us,  as  mockers  and  deceivers,  for \nuttering  a  sound  so  very  far  different  from  our \nmeaning  :  and  this  too,  when  it  is  not  even  a  settled \nand  agreed  thing  amongst  us  yet,  what  we  really \ndo  mean !

But  in \nthe  case  before  us,  the  soul-danger  and  the  de- \nception are  most  injurious. \n\nWho  would  not  laugh  at,  or  rather  hate,  that \nunseasonable  innovator  in  the  use  of  words,  who, \ncontrary  to  all  common  usage,  should  endeavour \nto  introduce  such  a  mode  of  speaking  as  to  call  a \nbeggar  rich;  not  for  having  any  money  of  his \nown,  but  because  some  king  might  perchance  give \nhim  his  ?  Especially,  if  he  should  do  this,  as \nthough  he  were  in  earnest ;  without  any  figure  of \nspeech,  such  as  antiphrasis  or  irony.  So,  if  he \nshould  call  one  that  is  sick  unto  death  a  man  in \nperfect  health ;  because  some  other  person,  who  is \nin  health,  might  possibly  make  him  whole,  like  him- \nself. So,  if  he  should  call  a  most  illiterate  idiot  a \nvery  learned  man;  because  some  other  person \nmight  possibly  give  him  letters.  It  is  just  the  same \nsort  of  thing  which  is  said  here — '  man  has  Free- \nwill': yes,  forsooth :  if  God  should  give  him  His. \nBy  such  an  abuse  of  speech,  any  man  might  boast \nhimself  of  any  thing :  as  for  instance,  that  he  is \nLord  of  heaven  and  earth  ;  that  is,  if  God  would \nbut  give  it  him.

In  other  words,  let  him \nknow  that  he  has,  with  regard  to  his  faculties  and \npossessions,  a  right  of  using  them — of  doing,  and \nof  forbearing  to  do — according  to  his  own  free \nwill ;  although  this  very  right  be  also  controlled \nby  God's  alone  free  will,  wheresoever  he  sees  fit \nto  interpose.  But  in  his  actings  towards  God,  in \nthings  pertaining  to  salvation  or  damnation,  he \nhas  no  free  will,  but  is  the  captive,  the  subject, \nand  the  servant,  either  of  the  will  of  God,  or  of \nthe  will  of  Satan.1 \n\n8  Quadruplatorum.']  This  name  was  applied,  under  the  Roman \nlaw,  to  '  public  informers/  who  gained  a  fourth  part  of  the \naccused's  goods,  or  of  the  fine  imposed  upon  him  :  or,  as  others \nsay,  because  they  accused  persons,  who,  upon  conviction, \nused  to  be  condemned  to  pay  fourfold;  as  those  guilty  of  ille- \ngal usury,  gaming,  or  the  like.  But  chiefly  mercenary  and \nfalse  accusers,  or  litigants,  were  called  by  this  name  ;  and  also \nthose  judges  who,  making  themselves  parties  in  a  cause,  de- \ncided in  their  own  favour.  Seneca  calls  those  who,  for  small \nservices,  sought  great  returns,  '  quadruplatores  beneficiorum \nsuorumj'  as  overrating  and  exaggerating  them. — Luther, \nhowever,  may  possibly  have  no  allusion  to  these  customs,  but \nuse  the  term,  according  to  its  essential  meaning,  for  '  a  bouncer' \nor  '  exaggerator  ;'  insinuating,  that  Erasmus's  statements  were \nof  this  kind.

I  have  said  thus  much  on  the  chapters  of  your \nPreface,  which  even  in  themselves  contain  almost \nthe  whole  of  our  matter ;  more  of  it,  I  might  say, \nthan  the  body  of  the  book  which  follows.  But  the \nconcludes  sum  of  these  is  what  might  be  dispatched  by  this \nshort  dilemma.  Your  preface  complains  either  of \nPre-  the  words  of  God,  or  of  the  words  of  man :  if,  of  the \nface,  by  re-  words  of  man,  it  is  all  written  in  vain,  and  I  have \nto adfiem^  no  concern  with  it ;  if,  of  the  words  of  God,  it  is \nma,  and  altogether  profane.  So  that,  it  would  have  been \nSortwork  more  profitable  to  make  this  our  question  ;  are  the \nof  some  of  words,  about  which  we  dispute,  God's  words  or \nins  sharp  man^s  words  ?  But,  perhaps  the  Proem  which \ngs*  follows,  and  the  disputation  itself,  will  discuss  this \nquestion. \n\nWhat  you  repeat  in  the  conclusion  of  your \npreface,  does  not  at  all  disturb  me :  as  'that  you \nshould  call  my  dogmas  fables,  and  useless ;'  '  that \nyou  should  say,  that  we  ought  rather,  after  the \nexample  of  Paul,  to  preach  Christ  crucified ;'  'that \nwisdom  must  be  taught  amongst  them  that  are  per- \nfect;' '  that  Scripture  has  its  language  variously \nattempered  to  the  state  of  the  hearers/  which \nmakes  you  think,  that  it  is  left  to  the  prudence \nand  charity  of  the  teacher,  to  preach  what  he  may \ndeem  suitable  to  his  neighbour. \n\nAll  this  is  absurdity  and  ignorance ;  I  also \npreach  nothing  but  Jesus  crucified  :  but  \"  Christ \ncrucified\"  brings  all  these  things  along  with  it; \nand  brings,  moreover,  that  very  wisdom  amongst \nthem  that  are  perfect :  since  there  is  no  other  wis- \ndom to  be  taught  amongst  Christians,  than  that \nwhich  is  hidden  in  a  mystery  and  belongs  to  the \n\nsel  of  his  own  will.\"  \"  Not  a  sparrow  falleth  to  the  ground \nwithout  your  Father  j\"  \"  He  is  all  (things)  in  all  (things).\" \nUnsafe;  because,  if  Freewill  be  admitted  any  .where,  why  not \nevery  where  ?  who  will  yield  to  our  authority,  when  we  say, \n'  it  is  here,  but  it  is  not  there?\"  The  truth  is,  man  is  a  free- \nagent,  though  not  a  free-wilier,  in  spiritual  things  3  and  he  is  no \nmore  in  temporal  things,  and  in  his  dealings  with  the  inferior \ncreatures.

I \nwas  so  much  affected  by  them  myself  for  more \nthan  ten  years,  that  I  think  no  other  person  was \never  equally  harassed  by  such  conflicts  :  and  it \nwas  utterly  incredible  to  me,  that  this  Troy  of \nmine,  which,  for  so  long  a  time,  and  during  so \nmany  wars,  had  proved  itself  to  be  invincible, \ncould  ever  be  taken.  Nay,  I  call  God  for  a  re- \ncord upon  my  soul,  that  I  should  have  continued \nin  my  opinion,  and  should,  to  this  day,  be  still \nimpressed  with  the  same  feelings,  if  it  were  not \nthat  the  goadings  of  my  own  conscience,  and \nthe  evidence  of  facts,  constrain  me  to  judge  dif- \nferently. You  can  have  no  difficulty  in  conceiving, \nthat,  although  my  heart  be  not  a  heart  of  stone, \nyet  if  it  were  one,  it  might  have  melted  in  the \nstruggle  and  collision  with  such  waves  and  tides \nas  I  brought  upon  myself,  by  daring  to  do  an  act, \n\na  Quam  tamen  dubiam  habent.~\\  The  pretended  ambiguity  of \nScripture  is  a  point  on  which  Erasmus  laid  great  stress,  and \nwhich  Luther,  hereafter,  most  powerfully  and  satisfactorily \nrepels. \n\nb  A  vaunting  insinuation  expressed  in  the  words  of  iEneas \n(Mn.  iv.  333,  334)  ;  by  which  Erasmus  would  lead  his  reader \nto  understand,  that  he  had  a  great  deal  still  behind. \n\n\n80  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  II.  which  would,  as  I  perceived,  cause  all  the  autho- \n\nrity  of  these  persons  whom  you  have  recounted, \n\nto  come  down,  with  all  the  violence  of  a  deluge, \nupon  my  own  head.0 \n\nBut  this  is  not  the  place  for  me  to  construct  a \nhistory  of  my  life,  or  of  my  works  ;  nor  have  I  taken \nthis  book  in  hand  with  the  design  of  commending \nmyself,  but  that  I  might  extol  the  grace  of  God. \nWhat  sort  of  a  man  I  am,  and  with  what  spirit \nand  design  I  have  been  hurried  into  these  trans- \nactions, I  commit d  to  that  Being,  who  knows  that \nall  these  things  have  been  effected,  not  by  my  own \nFreewill,  but  by  His :  howbeit,  even  the  world \nitself  ought  to  have  become  sensible  of  this,  long \nago.  It  is  evidently  a  very  invidious  situation \ninto  which  you  throw  me,  by  this  exordium  of \nyours :  from  which  it  is  not  easy  for  me  to  extri- \ncate myself,  without  trumpeting  my  own  praises, \nand  censuring  so  many  of  the  Fathers.  But  I  shall \nbe  short.  In  erudition,  genius,  numbers,  autho- \nrity, and  every  thing  else,  I  allow  the  cause  to  be \ntried  at  your  judgment-seat,  and  acknowledge \nmyself  the  inferior.6 \n\nc  Luther  claims  respect,  here,  for  three  properties  of  his \nmind  and  conduct ;  conscientiousness,  scrupulous  investiga- \ntion of  truth,  and  full  consciousnesss  of  the  evil  he  was  encoun- \ntering. Not  only  was  his  light  poured  in  very  gradually,  and \nadmitted  very  cautiously,  but,  from  first  to  last,  he  would  have \nbeen  often  glad  to  hold  his  tongue.  When  he  spoke,  or  wrote, \nit  was  because  God's  word  was  in  his  heart  as  a  burning  fire \nshut  up  in  his  bones,  and  he  was  weary  with  forbearing,  and \ncould  not  stay.

I  leave  my  character  and  my  conduct,  in \nthese  particulars,  with  my  God. \n\ne  Luther  considers  himself  as  arrayed,  in  opposition  to  the \nFathers,  before  the  judgment-seat  of  Erasmus.  His  defence \nmust  consist  of  self-praise  and  abuse  of  the  Fathers.  He  de- \nclines making  such  a  defence,  and  cuts  the  matter  short  by \nacknowledging  his  inferiority  ;  and,  that  in  all  the  points  of \ncompetition  which  Erasmus  had  introduced. — Dr.  Milner \nunderstands  him  to  reserve  three  ;  Viz.  the  Spirit,  miracles, \nsanctification.  But  this  does  not  appear  to  be  the  fair  con- \nstruction and  import  of  the  original  text.

(Did  Luther  indeed  mean^to  contest  the  palm  on  any \nof  these  three  grounds  of  excellency?) — But  then  he  abates  the \nforce  of  his  concessions,  by  remarking,  with  respect  to  those \nthree  distinctions  which  alone  are  of  any  value  in  the  number \nand  variety  claimed  for  his  adversaries,  that,  in  the  first  place, \nErasmus  could  not  define  them  ;  and,  in  the  next,  he  could  not \nprove  concerning  any  individual  of  his  vaunted  host,  that  he \npossessed  them.  (See  Miln.  Ecclesi.  Hist.  vol.  iv.  part  ii. \np.

By  c  sanctification',  the \nstate  of  a  saint  ;  that  is,  of  one  effectually  called  by  the  Holy \nGhost :  this  effectual  calling,  or  separation  of  the  Spirit,  being  that \nact  by  which  the  eternally  separated  of  the  Father  (Jude  ver.  1.) \nare  drawn  into  a  realized  and  recognised  union  with  the  sepa- \nrated one,  even  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ ;  in  whom  (Heb.  ii.  11.), \naccording  to  eternal  purpose  and  covenant,  they  are  separated  to \nGod.  So  that  '  separation  from  and  unto'  constitutes  the  essence \nof  sanctification  ;  into  which  the  Scripture  use  of  the  term  is \nevery  where  resolvable  :  not  a  gradual  work,  the  result  of \nrepeated  actions  of  the  Spirit  upon  the  substance  of  the  natural \nsoul,  as  human  authors  fondly  teach  -,  but  one  complete  and \nfinal  operation,  by  which  the  natural  soul  (Y^x^)  *s  made  a \nspiritual  soul  (jvevfxa)  j  as  holy,  with  respect  to  its  own  sub- \nstance, as  it  ever  will  be  in  eternity.  (See  1  Pet.  i.  2,  22,  23. \n2  Thess.  ii.  13.  John  vi.  37,  44,  63,  64.  See  also  the  kXtjto?* \n07/0^9,  '  called  to  be  saints,'  of  the  epistolary  inscriptions.) \nLuther  very  properly  distinguishes  this  '  sanctimonia,'  '  sanc- \ntum esse  vel  fuisse',  from  the  '  habere  spiritum  j'  that  is,  from \nthe  presence  of  the  Holy  Ghost  with,  and  his  consequent  actings \nin  and  by,  the  renewed  Spirit. \n\nG \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

For  you  do  not  deny,  but  even  assert,  -— \n\nthat  Freewill  is  not  a  matter  of  the  Spirit,  or  of \nChrist,  but  a  mere  human  affair ;  so  that  the  Spirit, \nwhich  was  promised,  that  he  might  glorify  Christ, \ncannot  possibly  preach  Freewill.  If,  therefore,  the \nFathers  have  sometimes  preached  Freewill;  as- \nsuredly they  have  spoken  by  the  flesh,  as  men,  and \nnot  by  the  Spirit  of  God:  much  less  have  they \nwrought  miracles,  that  they  might  support  it.  So \nthat  your  allegation  respecting  the  Fathers,  as \nhaving  been  sanctified,  had  the  Spirit,  and  wrought \nmiracles,  is  inapplicable :  since  it  is  not  Freewill, \nbut  the  dogma  of  Jesus  Christ i  as  opposed  to  that \nof  Freewill,  which  is  proved  thereby. \n\nBut  come  now,  ye  that  are  on  the  side  of  Free-  Luther \nwill,  and  assert  that  a  dogma  of  this  sort  is  true ;  challenges \nthat  is,  has  come  from  the  Spirit  of  God ;  still,  shew  ef- \nstill  I  say,  manifest  the  Spirit,  publish  your  mira-  6ctsofH. \ncles,  display  your  sanctification.

We  have  it \nin  charge  to  receive  no  dogma  whatsoever,  which \nhas  not  been  first  proved  by  divine  attestations. \n(Deut.xviii.  15 — 22.)

He  is  not  moved  by  the  merits  or  demerits \nof  a  carnal  age,  but  by  mere  pity  and  grace ;  and \nby  a  love  of  establishing  souls  in  solid  truth,  unto \nHis  glory .n    You  are  at  liberty  to  work  a  miracle \nas  small  as  you   please.

If,  in  so  great  a  series  of  ages  and \nof  men,  and  of  all  things  which  you  have  named, \nyou  shall  be  able  to  show  a  single  work  (let  it  be \nbut  the  lifting  up  of  a  straw  from  the  ground) ;  or  a \nsingle  word  (let  it  be  but  the  syllable  '  my');  or  a \nsingle  thought  (let  it  be  but  the  feeblest  sigh) — \nproceeding  from  Freewill — by  which  they  have \neither  applied  themselves  to  grace,  or  earned  the \nSpirit,  or  obtained  pardon  of  sin,  or  have  nego- \nciated  any  thing  (let  it  be  as  diminutive  as  you \nplease — we  will  not  talk  about  their  sanctification) \nwith  God;  be  ye  again  the  victors,  and  we  the  van- \nquished !

For,  as  to  what \nis  done  in  men  through  the  power  of  a  divine \ncreation,  it  has  Scripture  testimonies  in  abun- \ndance.

To  give  you  an  instance :  what  saying  can \nbe  more  carnal ;  nay,  what  saying  can  be  more  im- \npious, more  sacrilegious,  and  more  blasphemous  ; \nthan  that  wonted  one  of  Jerome's  ?  'Virginity  fills \nheaven,  and  marriage  earth/  As  if  earth,  and \nnot  heaven,  were  the  due  of  those  patriarchs, \napostles,  and  private  Christians,  who  have  married \nwives ;  or  heaven  were  the  due  of  vestal  virgins \namongst  the  heathens,  without  Christ !

As  the  Church \nof  Jerusalem,  Alexandria,  and  Antioch  have  erred,  so  also  the \nChurch  of  Rome  hath  erred  ;  not  only  in  their  living  and  man- \nner of  ceremonies,,  but  also  in  matters  of  faith.'— The  same \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PROEM  REVIEWED.  97 \n\nthat  some  elect  persons  are  held  in  error  all  their  sec.viii. \n\nlifetime,  still  they  must/ before  death,  return  into  \n\nthe  way ;  because  Christ  says  (John  x.  28.),  \"  No  Erasmus \none  shall  pluck  them  out  of  my  hand.\"     But  this  what  he°V€ \nmust  be  your  labour  and  your  achievement;  even  calls  the \nto  make  it  appear,  with  certainty,  that  those  whom  be1^e  ' t0 \nyou  call  the  Church,  are  the  Church ;  or,  rather,  Church. \nthat  those,  who  all  their  lifetime  were  wanderers, \nhave  not  at  length  been  brought  back  to  the  fold, \nbefore  they  died.     For  it  does  not  directly  follow, \nif  God  hath  suffered  all  those  whom  you  adduce \n(scattered  through  as  long  a  series  of  ages  as  you \nplease,  and  men  of  the  greatest  erudition,  if  you \nplease)  to  abide  in  error,  that  therefore  he  has \nsuffered  his  Church  to  abide  in  error. \n\nLook  at  Israel,  the  people  of  God :  of  all  their \nkings,  so  many  in  number,  and  reigning  during  so \nlong  a  period,  not  even  one  is  mentioned,  but  what \nerred.  And  under  Elias  the  Prophet,  to  such  a \ndegree  had  all  men,  and  all  that  was  public*  of  that \npeople,  departed  into  idolatry;  that  he  thought \nhimself  left  alone.  Yet,  in  the  mean  time,  whilst \nGod  was  going  to  destroy  kings,  princes,  priests, \nprophets,  and  whatsoever  could  be  called  the \npeople  or  church  of  God,  he  reserved  to  himself \nseven  thousand  men.  But  who  saw  or  knew  these \nto  be  the  people  of  God  ?  So  then,  who  will  dare \nto  deny,  that  God  hath  even  now  preserved  to \nhimself  a  Church  amongst  the  common  people, \nconcealed  under  those  principal  men,  (for  you \nmention  none  but  men  of  public  office  and  of \nname — )  and  hath  left  all  those  to  perish,  as  he  did \nin  the  kingdom  of  Israel  ?    since  it  is  God's  pecu- \n\nremark  extends  to  each  individual  of  the  faithful.  Who  hath  not \nerred  in  his  lifetime  ?  Of  whom  shall  we  say,  that  he  died \nwithout  any  mixture  of  error  in  his  creed  ? — Luther's  repre- \nsentation, therefore,  requires  restriction  :  of  such  error  as  he \nis  disputing  about,  it  holds  good. \n\np  Omne  quod  publicum  erat.']  c  Men  of  public  station,,  as \nopposed  to  private  men.'

There  was,  indeed,  a  people  of  God  re- \nmaining, but  it  was  not  called  so  :  what  was  called \nso,  was  not  that  people.  Who  knows,  whether \nsuch  may  not  have  been  the  state  of  the  Church \nof  God  always,  during  the  whole  course  of  the \nworld,  from  its  beginning ;  that  some  have  been \ncalled  the  people  and  saints  of  God,  who  were  not \nreally  so ;  whilst  others,  abiding  as  a  remnant  in \nthe  midst  of  them,  have  been,  but  have  not  been \ncalled,  his  people  or  saints  ?  as  is  shewn  by  the \nhistory  of  Cain  and  Abel,  of  Ishmael  and  Isaac,  of \nEsau  and  Jacob. \n\nLook  at  the  Arian  period  :r  when  scarcely  five \n\n°i  Frequent  promises  are  made  in  this  Prophet  that '  a  remnant \nshall  be  left.'  \"  Except  the  Lord  of  Hosts  had  left  us  a  very \nsmall  remnant,  we  should  have  been  as  Sodom,\"  &c.  (Is.  i.  9.) \n\"  The  remnant  of  Israel  and  such  as  are  escaped  of  the  house  of \n\nJacob Theremnant  shall  return,  even  the  remnant  of  Jacob, \n\nunto  the  mighty  God.\"  <e  For  though  my  people  Israel  be  as \nthe  sand  of  the  sea,  yet  a  remnant  of  them  shall  return.\" \n(x.  20,  21,  22.  Comp.  Rom.  ix.  27.)  So  Is.  xi  11— 16.  But  I \ndo  not  find  the  expressions  '  dregs'  and  '  remnant'  united. \n\nr  Arrianorum  seculum.~]  Arianism  arose  early  in  the  fourth \ncentury ;  about  three  hundred  years  before  the  rise  of  the \nPopedom  ;  and,  though  condemned  by  Councils,  was  adopted \nby  several  of  Constantine's  successors,  and  became  a  source  of \ngrievous  persecution  to  those  who  were  sound  in  the  faith. \nFor  an  account  of  its  origin  and  real  nature,  see  Milner's  Eccles. \nHist.  vol.  ii.  pp.  51 — 54.  It  was,  in  substance,  a  denial  of  the \nco-eternity,  co-equality,  and  co-essentiality  of  the  Lord  Jesus \nChrist  with  the  Father.  '  Already  some  secret  and  ambiguous \nattempts  had  been  made  to  lessen  the  idea  of  the  divinity  of  the \nSon  of  God.   While  his  eternity  was  admitted  by  Eusebius  the \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PROEM  REVIEWED.  99 \n\nCatholic3  bishops  were  preserved  in  all  the  world,  sec.viii. \nand   those   driven   from   their   sees;   the  Arians  \n\nhistorian,  lie  yet  was  not  willing  to  own  him  co-equal  with \nthe  Father.  Arius  went  greater  lengths  :  he  said,  'That  the  Son \nproceeded  out  of  a  state  of  non-existence  ;  that  he  was  not \nbefore  he  was  made  ;  that  he,  who  is  without  beginning,  has \nset  his  Son  as  the  beginning  of  things  that  are  made  j  and  that \nGod  made  one,  whom  he  called  Word,  Son,  and  Wisdom,  by \nwhom  he  did  create  us.'  (Miln.  in  loc.)  Like  all  the  rest  of \nheresy,  it  is  truth  corrupted ;  and  the  only  solid  and  satisfac- \ntory answer  will  be  given  to  it,  not  by  boldly  asserting  and \nproving  the  real  and  proper  divinity  of  the  Lord  Jesus,  but  by \nshowing  forth  his  whole  person  in  its  complexity ;  made  up, \nas  it  is,  of  two  persons,  a  divine  person  and  an  human  person, \nheld  together  by  an  indissoluble  union  :  the  secret  being,  that \nGod  does  all  his  works  by  this  complex  person's  agency,  who \nacts  in  his  human  person  as  plenarily  inspired  by  the  Holy \nGhost.  This  person  who  thus  doeth  that  will  of  God — of  God, \neven  the  Trinity — which  is  referred  to  the  Father  personally ; \ndoes  hereby,  amongst  other  subjects  of  manifestation,  especially \nmanifest  that  which  we  may  well  suppose  to  be  the  preemi- \nnent object  of  display  in  the  tri-une  Jehovah,  the  threefold \npersonality  of  his  one  undivided  essence. — I  am  aware  that  the \nterm  '  union  of  persons,'  as  substituted  for  •  union  of  natures,' \nwill  be  deemed  objectionable,  till  it  is  well  considered  :  but  I \nhave  the  authority  of  one  of  the  best  philosophers  I  know,  for \nthus  entitling  the  human  part  of  the  person  of  the  Lord  Jesus \nChrist.  e  That  which  can  contrive,  which  can  design,  must  be \na  person.  These  capacities  constitute  personality,  for  they  imply \nconsciousness  and  thought.  They  require  that  which  can  per- \nceive an  end  or  purpose ;  as  well  as  the  power  of  providing \nmeans,  and  of  directing  them  to  their  end.  They  require  a  cen- \ntre in  which  perceptions  unite,  and  from  which  volitions  flow ; \nwhich  is  mind.  The  acts  of  a  mind  prove  the  existence  of  a \nmind  •  and  in  whatever  a  mind  resides  is  a  person.  The  seat  of \nintellect  is  a  person.'  (Paley's  Nat.  Theol.  pp.  439,  440,  14th \nEdn.)  Now,  is  it  not  plain  from  Scripture,  and  the  admis- \nsion of  all  Christians,  with  a  very  few  heretical  exceptions, \nthat  the  Lord  Jesus  had  this  human  mind,  distinct  from  his \ngodhead  ?  he  had,  therefore,  according  to  this  description,  a \nperson  distinct  from  his  divine  person. — And,  what  is  to  hinder \nthat  divine  person,  if  the  will  of  God  be  so,  from  taking  up  an \nhuman  person  into  union  with  himself,  and  acting  in  that  per- \nson, from  thenceforth,  not  in  his  divine  person?  Is  not  that \nunion  real,  which  subsists  between  this  divine  person  and  this \nhuman  person ;  when  this  human  person,  having  been  first \ngenerated,  is  afterwards  inhabited,  by  his  co-equal  co- essential \nin  the  unity  of  God  ?     Does  it  not  also  subsist  without  for- \n\nh2 \n\n\n100  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  ii.  reigning  every  where,  under  the  public  name,  and \n\nas  filling  the  office/  of  the  Church.    Nevertheless, \n\nunder  the  dominion  of  those  heretics,  Christ  pre- \nserved his  Church;  but  in  such  a  form,  that  it  was \nby  no  means  supposed  to  be,  or  regarded  as,  the \nChurch. \n\nUnder  the  reign  of  the  Pope,  shew  me  a  single \nbishop  discharging  his  duty;  shew  me  a  single \nCouncil,  in  which  matters  of  piety  were  treated  of; \n\nfeiture  of  distinctness  ?  Is  it  not  also  constant  and  unbroken, \nwhen  that  divine  person  evermore  acts  in  and  by  that  human \nperson,  putting  his  godhead  as  it  were  into  abeyance  ?  Yet, \nare  not  his  acts  and  his  sufferings  the  acts  and  sufferings  of  the \nco-equal  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Holy  Ghost  ?  There  is  no \ndiminution,  it  is  plain,  of  his  essential  godhead,  in  his  volun- \ntarily, and  to  a  great  end,  submitting  to  act  by  and  in  this \ncreature  person  ;  which  constitutes  him  at  the  same  time  both \ncreature  and  Creator  :  very  man  doeth  the  works  of  God,  and \nvery  God  doeth  the  works  of  man. — And,  if  this  complexity  of \nperson  is  thus  to  be  realized  in  time,  what  is  to  hinder  that \nperson  in  God,  in  whom  it  is  to  be  realized,  from  transacting \nas  though  he  actually  were  this  complex  person,  from  and  in \nthe  beginning?  Is  not  Jehovah's  will  both  immutable  and \nirresistible  ?  is  it  not  his  propriety,  to  call  things  which  are  not \nas  though  they  were,  and  to  give  realized  being  to  substances \nwhich,  as  yet,  exist  in  predestination  ?  And  must  he  not  have \nacted  thus  in  this  particular  instance,  when  he  chose  a  people \nof  mankind  to  be  in  this  complex  person  as  a  head,  and  gave \ngrace  to  that  people  so  chosen,  before  the  world  began  ? — \nNow,  therefore,  we  can  meet  Arius  upon  his  own  ground,  and \nconfound  him  even  there.  Admitting  all  that  he  says,  and \nsays  from  the  plain  text  of  Scripture,  about  '  begotten,'  '  non- \nexistence,' '  was  not  before  he  was  made,'  '  God  hath  made  one \nwhom  he  calls  Word,  Son,  and  Wisdom,  by  whom  he  did \ncreate  us  •/  this  in  no  wise  impugns  the  co-eternity,  co-equa- \nlity, and  co-essentiality  of  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  with  the \nFather :  his  human  person,  by  and  in  which  he  has  thus  been \ndoing  all  things,  is  the  creature  which  Arius  would  describe ; \nbut  he  who  assumed  this  person  into  union  with  himself  is \nvery  God  ;  which  implies,  that  he  is  all  that  God  is. \n\ns  Catholici.~\\  Cath.  opposed  to  heretical;  a  Greek  term  (aipeais^ \nalpeTLKor)  denoting  '  selection',  or  '  partiality,'  as  opposed  to \nthe  profession  of  the  whole  faith. \n\n1  Publico  nomine  el  officio^]  They  were  publicly  called,  and \nrecognised  as,  Christ's  Church  5  and  performed  its  public \nfunctions. \n\n\nERASxMUS'S  PROEM  REVIEWED.  101 \n\nand  not  robes,  dignity,  revenues,  and  other  pro-  sec.viii. \nfane  trifles,  which  none  but  a  madman  can  attri-  — ■ \nbute  to  the  Holy  Spirit.

If  they \ncould  be  discerned  by  the  eye,  that  Scripture  would  be  falsi- \nfied, which  saith,  '  The  wicked  shall  not  see  the  glory  of  God.' \nI  do  not  find  this  text  to  which  he  appears  to  refer.  The  Lord's \npeople  are  expressly  called  'his  hidden  ones.'

But \nfaith  calls  no  man  a  saint,  except  he  be  declared \nsuch  by  a  divine  judgment.  Because  it  is  the \nproperty  of  faith,  not  to  be  deceived.  So  that, \nwhereas,  we  ought  all  to  be  accounted  saints  mu- \ntually, by  the  law  of  charity ;  still,  no  one  ought \nto  be  decreed  a  saint  by  the  law  of  faith;  as \nthough  it  were  an  article  of  faith,  that  this  or  that \nman  is  a  saint.  It  is  in  this  way,  that  the  Pope, \nthat  great  adversary  of  God,  who  sets  himself  in \nthe  place  of  God,  canonizes  his  saints  :  of  whom \nhe  knows  not  that  they  are  saints.0 \nHow  Lu-  This  only  I  affirm,  with  respect  to  those  saints \nseparIt°eUld  °^  vours:>  or  rather  of  ours  ;  that,  since  they  are  at \nwriters,  variance  amongst  themselves,  those  rather  should \nand  parts    ^ye  been  followed  who  spoke  the  best  things; \n\nor  writings.    ,,      ,    .  ,   -»-,  •it  •  ,      r  i \n\nthat  is,  against  Jbreewill  m  support  ot  grace;  and \nthose  should  have  been  left,  who,  through  infir- \nmity of  the  flesh,  have  witnessed  to  the  flesh, \nrather  than  to  the  Spirit.

Nay,  it  is  on  this  ground,  that  I  have \nhitherto  inveighed  against  the  Pope  himself;  in \nwhose  kingdom  nothing  is  more  commonly  urged, \nor  more  commonly  received,  than  this  saying, \nc  That  the  Scriptures  are  obscure  and  ambigu- \nous ;'  e  that  we  must  seek  the  interpreting  spirit \nfrom  the  Apostolic  See  of  Rome/  There  cannot \nbe  a  more  pernicious  assertion  than  this ;  from \nwhich  ungodly  men  have  taken  occasion  to  exalt \nthemselves  above  the  Scriptures,  and  to  fabricate \njust  what  they  pleased  :  till  at  length,  having  quite \ntrodden  the  Scriptures  under  foot,  we  were  be- \nlieving and  teaching  nothing  but  the  dreams  of \nmadmen.

I  have  called  it  above  cthe  internal \nclearness  of  Holy  Scripture/1  Perhaps,  this  is \nwhat  was  meant  by  those  who  have  replied  to  you, \nc  that  every  thing  must  be  determined  by  the  judg- \nment of  the  Spirit/  But  this  judgment  is  of  no \nprofit  to  any  other  person  besides  ourselves,  and \nis  not  the  subject  of  inquiry  in  this  cause  :  nor \ndoes  any  one,  I  dare  say,  doubt  that  this  judg- \nment is  just  what  I  state  it  to  be. \n\nThere  is,  therefore,  another  judgment,  which  is \nexternal ;  and  by  which  we,  not  only  for  our- \nselves, but  for  others,  and  for  the  salvation  of \nothers,  do  with  the  greatest  certainty  judge  the \nspirits  and  dogmas  of  all  men.  This  is  the  judg- \nment of  the  public  ministry,  an  outward  office, \nappealing  to  the  word :  what  belongs  chiefly  to \nthe  leaders  of  the  people,  and  preachers  of  the \nword.k  We  use  it  to  confirm  the  weak,  and  to \n\n1  See  Part  i.

Luther  refers  to  the  judgment \nof  a  synod,  or  council ;  a  tribunal,  to  which  he  always  de- \nclared himself  willing*  to  submit  his  own  obnoxious  assertions. \nHe  states  the  matter  too  broadly,  and  was  guided  by  an \nimage  which  he  had  in  his  mind  of  what  might  be,  rather  than \nby  any  exhibition  of  this  external  judgment  which  he  had  ever \nseen,  or  could  appeal  to  as  an  example.  A  synod  of  real \nsaints  might  be  confidently  looked  to,  as  decreeing  under  the \nillumination  of  a  light  from  above.  But  when  has  such  a  synod \nmet  since  the  council  of  Jerusalem  ?  (Acts  xv.  1 — 31.)  If,  as \nit  is  probable,  there  be  real  saints  in  the  council,  who  is  to \nensure  their  being  the  majority?  Whilst  great  respect,  there- \nfore, is  due  to  a  judgment  of  this  kind,  it  cannot  be  that  infal- \nlible one,  which  Luther's  commendations  might  seem  to  imply. \n\n\n108 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n\npart  ii.   confute  the  gainsayers.     I  have  called  this  above \n\n•'  the  external  clearness  of  Holy  Scripture/      Our \n\nassertion  is,  '  Let  all  the  spirits  be  tried  in  the \nface  of  the  Church  at  the  bar  of  Scripture/  For \nit  ought  to  be  a  first  principle,  most  firmly  main- \ntained amongst  Christians,  that  the  Holy  Scrip- \ntures are  a  spiritual  light,  far  brighter  than  the \nsun ;  especially  in  those  things  which  pertain  to \nsalvation,  or  are  necessary. \n\nBut,  since  we  have  now  for  a  long  time  been \npersuaded  to  a  contrary  opinion  by  that  pestilent \nsaying  of  the  Sophists,  '  That  the  Scriptures  are \nobscure  and  ambiguous;''  I  am  compelled,  in  the \nfirst  place,  to  prove  that  very  first  principle  of \nours,  by  which  all  the  rest  are  to  be  proved:— \nwhat  would  to  philosophers  appear  absurd  and \nimpossible. \n\nFirst,  then,  Moses  says  (Deut.  xvii.  8),  that,  if \nany  difficult  cause  should  arise,  they  must  go  up \nto  the  place  which  God  hath  chosen  for  his  name, \n\n\nSEC.XIII. \n\n\nClearness \nof  Scrip- \nture   prov- \ned, by  testi- \nmonies \nfrom  the \nOld  Testa- \nment. \n\n\nIt  is  not  strictly  parallel  to  the  '  external  clearness'  of  Scrip- \nture 3  which  he  refers  to,  as  asserted,  Part  i.  Sect.  iv.  The \ntestimony  may  be  imperfectly  brought  out ;  or  the  judges  may \nnot  have  eyes  to  see  it.  Would  Luther  undertake  to  say,  that \nhe  should  himself  bring  all  the  testimony  that  is  in  the  Scrip- \ntures, to  bear  upon  any  given  question  ;  or  would  he,  had  he \nbeen  able  to  cite  it,  have  convinced  the  Council  of  Constance, \nor  the  Council  of  Trent  ?  After  all,  the  private  and  internal \njudgment  which  he  speaks  of;  the  Spirit  shining  upon  and  con- \nfirming his  testimony  by  the  word,  is  that  which  the  spiritual \nman  must,  and  will,  at  last  resort  to,  and  can  alone  depend \nupon.  He  is  thankful  for,  and  in  some  sense  obedient  to,  the1 \njudgment  of  pure  synods  (pure  as  such  compounds  can  be  ex- \npected to  be)  5  but  to  a  higher  Master  he  standeth  or  falleth. \n\"  This  I  say  then,  walk  in\"  (or  after)  \"the  spirit.\"  (Gal.  v.  16.) \n— Enough  for  Luther's  purpose  may,  however,  be  admitted.  Let \nall  dogmas  be  brought  to  the  standard  of  Scripture,  publicly ; \nlet  the  leaders  and  counsellors  of  the  people  declare  upon  them, \nstating  the  grounds  of  their  decision.  Such  judgment  will \nhave  its  weight,  though  not  paramount ;  and  it  will  be  mani- \nfested how  slender,  or  how  false,  are  the  foundations  of  error. \nThis  object  is  obtained,  in  a  great  degree,  now,  by  the  free \ncanvass  which  religious,  as  well  as  other  opinions,  are  made  to \nsubmit  to,  from  the  press. \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PROEM  REVIEWED.  109 \n\nand  there  consult  the  Priests,  who  must  judge  it  SEC.xm. \n\naccording  to  the  law  of  the  Lord.     \"  According \n\nto  the  law  of  the  Lord/'  saith  he.  But  how  shall \nthey  judge,  except  the  law  of  the  Lord,  wherewith \nthe  people  must  be  satisfied,  were  externally l  most \nplain?  Else,  it  were  enough  to  say,  'They  shall \njudge  according  to  their  own  spirit/  Nay,  the \ntruth  is,  that  in  every  civil  government,  all  the \ncauses  of  all  the  subjects  are  settled  by  the  laws. \nBut  how  could  they  be  settled,  except  the  laws \nwere  most  certain,  and  just  like  so  many  shining \nlights  amongst  the  people.  For,  if  the  laws  were \nambiguous  and  uncertain,  not  only  would  it  be \nimpossible  that  any  causes  should  be  decided,  but \nthere  could  be  no  certain  standard  of  manners  : \nsince  laws  are  made  for  this  very  purpose,  that \nthe  manners  of  the  people  may  be  regulated  by  a \ncertain  model  •  and  the  principles  by  which  causes \nare  to  be  determined,  may  be  defined.111  That \nwhich  is  to  be  the  standard  and  measure  of  other \nthings,  ought  itself  to  be  by  much  the  surest  and \nclearest  of  all  things :  and  such  a  sort  of  thing  is \nthe  law.  Now,  if  this  light  and  certainty  in  their \nlaws  be  both  necessary,  and  also  conceded  freely \nto  the  whole  world,  by  a  divine  gift,  in  profane \ngovernments  (which  are  conversant  about  tem- \nporal things) ;  how  is  it  possible,  that  God  should \nnot  have  granted  laws  and  rules  of  much  greater \nlight  and  certainty  to  his  christian  people  (Jiis \nchosen,  forsooth);  whereby  to  direct  their  own \nhearts  and  lives  individually,  and  to  settle  all  their \ncauses?  since  He  would  have  temporal  things  to \nbe  despised  by  his  children  ?

When \nChrist  had  put  the  Sadducees  to  silence  (Matt. \nxxii.  23 — 32.),  by  citing  Scripture,  and  proving \nthe  resurrection  of  the  dead  from  the  words  of \nMoses  (Exod.  iii.  6.),  \"  I  am  the  God  of  Abra- \nham, &c.\" \"  He  is  not  the  God  of  the  dead,  but \n\nof  the  living — \"  upon  this,  they  could  not  resist,  or \nsay  any  thing  in  reply.

Probably,  he  had \nbeen  led  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  to  aim  at  beating  down  the  idola- \ntrous attachment  which  the  Jews  shewed  to  their  Temple,  in  his \nreasonings  with  those  who  arose  and  disputed  with  him.

Yet  they \ndid  resist,  and  persevered  in  their  resistance,  till \nthey  burnt  him  :  so  far  were  they  from  altering \ntheir  mind.  Nor  does  Christ  suppress  this,  when \nhe  says,  '  the  adversaries  shall  not  be  able  to \nresist.'  They  are  adversaries,  says  he ;  therefore \nthey  will  resist.  If  they  did  not  resist,  they \nwould  not  be  adversaries,  but  friends ;  and  yet \nthey  shall  not  be  able  to  resist.

For  it  is  thus,  that  even \nthe  Evangelists  themselves,  after  expressing  their \nwonder  how  it  should  happen  that  the  Jews  were \nnot  taken  with  the  works  and  words  of  Christ — \nwhich  were  absolutely  irresistible  and  undeniable — \nreply   to   their   own   expressions  of  wonder,  by \nciting  this  passage  of  Scripture  r1  by  suggesting, \nforsooth,  that  man,  left  to  himself,  seeing  sees  not, \nand  hearing  hears  not.

Now,  if  there  be  those  who  do  not \nsee  this  clearness,  and  are  blind,  or  stumble,  in  this \nsunshine  ;  these,  on  the  supposition  that  they  are \nungodly  men,  shew  how  great  is  the  majesty  and \npower  of  Satan  in  the  sons  of  men:  even  such,  that \nthey  neither  hear  nor  apprehend  the  clearest \nwords  of  God.  Just  as  if  a  man,  beguiled  by \nsome  sleight  of  hand  trick,  should  suppose  the \nsun  to  be  a  piece  of  unlighted  coal,  or  should \nimagine11  a  stone  to  be  gold!  On  the  supposi- \ntion that  they  are  godly  persons,  let  them  be \nreckoned  amongst  those  of  the  elect,  who  are  led \ninto  error  some  little,  that  the  power  of  God  may \nbe  shewn  in  us  :  without  which,  we  can  neither  see, \nnor  do  any  thing  at  all.  For,  it  is  not  weakness  of \nintellect  (as  you  complain),  which  hinders  the \nwords  of  God  from  being  apprehended :  on  the \ncontrary,  nothing  is  more  adapted  to  the  appre- \nhension of  the  words  of  God,  than  weakness  of \nintellect.  For,  it  is  because  of  the  weak,  and  unto \nthe  weak,  that  Christ  both  came,  and  also  sends \nhis  word.

The  term  f  horns'  is  applied  to  argumentation  ;  from \na  certain  disposition  of  forces,  as  well  naval  as  military,  in \nwhich  they  resemble  the  horns  of  the  crescent  moon. \n\n\nERASMUS'S  PROEM  REVIEWED.  127 \n\nto  be  driven  upon  this  horn  of  the  two,  c  that  the  sec.xx. \n\nScripture  is  not  plain '  (what  you  are  driving  at  - \n\nthroughout  your  whole  book);  it  remains,  that  you \nmust  have  pronounced  them  to  be  most  expert  in \nScripture,  and  martyrs  for  Christ,  either  in  fun  or \nin  flattery — certainly  not  seriously — merely  to \nthrow  dust  in  the  eyes  of  the  common  people,  and \nto  give  Luther  trouble,  by  loading  his  cause  with \nhatred  and  contempt,  through  vain  words.  How- \never, I  pronounce  neither  true;  but  both  false. \nI  affirm,  first,  that  the  Scriptures  are  most  clear; \nsecondly,  that  those  persons,  so  far  as  they  assert \nFreewill,  are  most  ignorant  of  the  Scriptures; \nthirdly,  that  they  made  this  assertion  neither  with \ntheir  life,  nor  by  their  death,  but  only  with  their \npen — and  that,  under  absence  of  mind. \n\nI  do  therefore  conclude  this  little  disputation/ \nthus.  '  By  Scripture — seeing  that  it  is  obscure — \nnothing  certain  has  yet  been  determined,  or \ncan  be  determined,  on  the  subject  of  Freewill ; \naccording  to  your  own  testimony/  That,  '  by \nthe  lives  of  all  men,  from  the  beginning  of  the \nworld,  nothing  has  been  shewn  in  support  of \nFreewill/  is  what  I  have  argued  above.

I  am,  therefore,  com- \npelled to  beat  out  the  several  parts  of  it,  for  my- \nself The  thing  defined,  if  it  be  strictly  examined, \nis  certainly  of  wider  range  than  the  definition:  it \nis,  therefore,  what  the  Sophists  would  call  a  de- \nfective definition;  such  being  their  term  for  those \nwhich  do  not  fill  up  the  thing  defined.15  For  I \nhave  shewn  above,  that  Freewill  belongs  to  none \nbut  God  only.  You  might,  perhaps  with  pro- \npriety, attribute  will  to  man;  but  to  attribute  free \nwill  to  him,  in  divine  things,0  is  too  much :  since \nthe  term  Freewill,  in  the  judgment  of  all  ears,  is \n\na  Bald  and  bare  $'  without  any  appendage  of  amplification, \nresolution  of  parts,  or  illustration. \n\nb  The  idea  is  that  of  a  mould  not  filled  up  :  the  definition  is \nnot  commensurate  with  the  thing  defined. \n\nc  See  Part  i.

With  how  much \nless  propriety  do  we  call  a  man,  or  an  angel,  free  : \nwhen  they  live  under  the  most  absolute  subjec- \ntion to  God  (to  say  nothing  of  sin  and  death),  so \nas  not  to  subsist  for  a  moment  by  their  own \nstrength. \n\nInstantly,  therefore,  even  at  the  very  doors  of \nour  argument,  we  have  a  quarrel  between  the  de- \nfinition of  the  name,  and  the  definition  of  the  thing; \nthe  word  signifying  one  thing,  and  the  thing  itself \nbeing  understood  to  be  another.  It  would  be \nmore  properly  called  vertible  will,  or  mutable  will. \nFor  thus  Augustine,  and  after  him  the  Sophists, \nextenuates  the  glory  and  virtue  of  that  word  Free; \nadding  this  disparagement  to  it,  '  that  they  speak \nof  the  vertibility  of  the  free  will/  And  so  it \nwould  become  us  to  speak,  that  we  might  avoid \ndeceiving  the  hearts  of  men  by  inflated,  vain,  and \npompous  words  :  as  Augustine  also  thinks,  that  we \nought  to  speak  in  sober  and  plain  words,  observ- \ning a  fixed  rule.

Some  of  these  are  suf- \nficiently manifest;  others  flee  the  light,  as  though \na  guilty  conscience  made  them  afraid  of  every \nthing :  yet  a  definition  ought  to  be  the  plainest \nand  most  certain  thing  in  the  world;  for  to  define \nobscurely,  is  just  like  not  defining  at  all.

I  have  to  do, \nas  I  perceive,  with  a  very  Scotus  or  Heraclitus;f \nwho  wears  me  out  with  two  sorts  of  labour. \nFirst,  I  have  to  go  in  search  of  my  adversary,  and \nto  grope  for  him  in  the  dark,  amidst  pitfalls,  with \na  palpitating  heart  (a  daring  and  dangerous  en- \n\ne  A/idabate.\"]  ( A  man  fighting  in  the  dark,  with  his  eyes \nblinded  :'  a  name  given  (quasi  ai/afiarai  sive  avravafia-ai)  to  cer- \ntain fencers,  or  gladiators,  who  fought  on  horseback  with  their \neyes  covered  ;  or,  more  properly,  '  to  the  man  who  went  up \ninto  the  chariot  to  fight  with  the  charioteer.'

Secondly,  if  I  shall  have  dragged  him  into \nthe  light;  then  at  length,  when  I  am  worn  out \nwith  the  pursuit,  I  have  to  close  with  him  in \nequal  fight. \n\nBy  c  a  power  of  the  human  will/  then,  is  meant, \nas  I  suppose,  an  ability,  or  faculty,  or  disposedness, \nor  suitedness,  to  will,  to  refuse,  to  choose,  to  de- \nspise, to  approve,  to  reject,  and  to  perform  whatever \nother  actions  there  are  of  the  human  will.  But, \nwhat  is  meant  by  this  same  power  c  applying  itself \nand  turning  away  itself;'  except  it  be  this  very \nwilling  and  refusing,  this  very  choosing  and  de- \nspising, this  very  approving  and  rejecting;  in \nshort,  except  it  be  c  the  will  performing  its  very \noffice ;'  I  see  not.  So  that  we  must  suppose  this \npower  to  be  c  a  something  interposed  between  the \nwill  itself  and  its  actings  :'  a  power,  by  which  the \nwill  itself  draws  out  the  operation  of  willing  and \nrefusing,  and  by  which  that  very  act  of  willing  and \nrefusing  is  elicited.  It  is  not  possible  to  imagine \nor  conceive  any  thing  else  here.  If  I  be  mistaken, \nlet  the  fault  be  charged  upon  the  author  who  de- \nfines, not  upon  me  who  am  searching  out  his  mean- \ning. For,  it  is  rightly  said  by  the  jurists,  that  the \nwords  of  him  who  speaks  obscurely,  when  he \nmight  speak  more  plainly,  are  to  be  interpreted \nagainst  himself.

The  Law  was  designed \nto  shut  the  Church  up  unto  faith ;  the  Gospel,  to  open  it,  by \nthat  faith  which  is  itself  a  work  (for  \"  this  is  the  work  of  God \nthat  ye  believe  on  Him  whom  He  hath  sent.\"  John  vi.  29.)  to \nthose  works  which  alone  are  acceptable  to  God ;  viz.  the \nactings  and  manifestations  of  a  self-emptied,  contrite,  and \nbelieving  soul. \n\nk  He  speaks  not  of  any  particular  word  or  work  of  God,  but \nof  his  whole  word,  and  of  his  whole  work ;  excepting  only \nwhat  he  does,  by  his  special  grace,  in  and  upon  the  hearts  of \nhis  people. \n\n\n134  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  future  life,  and  of  the  resurrection?

Now,  since  death,  the  cross,  and \nall  the  evils  of  the  world  are  numbered  amongst \nthose  works  of  God  which  lead  to  salvation ;  the \nhuman  will  must  be  able  to  choose  even  death  and \nthe  man's  own  destruction.  Nay,  it  is  able  to \nwill  all  things ;  whilst  it  is  able  to  will  the  word \nand  work  of  God.  For,  what  can  there  be  any \nwhere,  that  is  below,  above,  within,  or  without,  the \nword  and  work  of  God  ;  save  God  himself?11  And \nwhat  is  now  left  to  grace,  and  the  Holy  Spirit  ? \nThis  is  manifestly  to  attribute  divinity  to  Free- \nwill :  since  to  will  the  Law  and  the  Gospel,  to  re- \nject sin,  and  to  choose  death,  is  the  property  of \ndivine  virtue  exclusively;  as  Paul  teaches  in  more \nplaces  than  one. \n\nHence  it  appears,  that  no  man,  since  the  Pela- \ngians' days,  has  written  more  correctly  on  Free- \nwill, than  Erasmus  has.  For  I  have  said  before, \nthat  Freewill  is  a  term  peculiar  to  God,  and  ex- \npresses a  divine  perfection.  However,  no  man \nhas  attributed  this  divine  power  to  it  hitherto, \nexcept  the  Pelagians  :  for  the  Sophists,  whatever \nthey  may  think,  certainly  speak  very  differently \nabout  it.  Nay,  Erasmus  far  exceeds  the  Pela- \ngians :  for  they  attribute  this  divinity  to  the  whole \nof  the  free  will,  Erasmus  to  half  of  it.  They  make \nFreewill  to  consist  of  two  parts;  a  power  of  dis- \n\nn  Intrci  extrh.']  '  On  this  side  of  it,  or  beyond  it :'  which,  when \njoined  with  the  preceding  words  ( infra,  supra/  express  *  the \nuniversal  comprehension  of  the  word  and  work  of  God  5'  as \ncontaining  '  all  that  is  above,  beneath,  and  on  all  sides  of  us' — \nwith  only  one  exception. \n\n\n130 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n\npart  in.  cerning,  and  a  power  of  choosing:  of  which  they \n\nfeign  the  one  to  belong  to  the  understanding,  and \n\nthe  other  to  the  will ;  as  the  Sophists  also  do.  But \nErasmus,  making  no  mention  of  the  power  of  dis- \ncerning, confines  his  praises  to  the  power  of \nchoosing,  singly ;  and  so  deifies  a  sort  of  crippled \nand  half-begotten  Freewill.  What  would  he  have \ndone,  think  you,  if  he  had  been  set  to  describe  the \nwhole  of  this  faculty  ? \n\nYet,  not  content  with  this,  he  even  exceeds  the \nheathen  philosophers.  For  they  have  not  yet \ndetermined  c  whether  any  substance  can  put  itself \ninto  motion;'  and  on  this  point,  the  Platonics  and \nPeripatetics  differ  from  each  other,  throughout  the \nwhole  body  of  their  philosophy.  But,  according \nto  Erasmus,  Freewill  not  only  moves  itself,  but \napplies  even  to  those  things  which  are  eternal; \nthat  is,  incomprehensible  to  itself;  by  its  own \npower.  A  perfectly  new  and  unheard-of  definer \nof  Freewill;  who  leaves  heathen  philosophers, \nPelagians,  Sophists,  and  all  others,  far  behind \nhim  !  Nor  is  this  enough :  he  does  not  even  spare \nhimself,  but  even  disagrees  and  fights  with  him- \nself, more  than  with  all  the  rest.  He  had  before \nsaid,  '  the  human  will  is  altogether  inefficacious \nwithout  grace;'  (did  he  say  this  in  jest?)  but \nnow,  when  he  defines  it  seriously,  he  tells  us  that \nthe  human  will  possesses  that  power,  whereby  it \nis  efficacious  to  apply  itself  to  those  things  which \nare  belonging  to  eternal  salvation;  that  is,  to \nthose  things  which  are  incomparably  above  its \npower.

The  Sophists  (or  at  least  their \nfather,  Peter  Lombard)  deliver  what  is  far  more \ntolerable  to  us,  when  they  affirm,  that  e  Freewill  is \nthe  faculty  of  first  discerning  good  from  evil,  and \nthen  choosing  good  or  evil  according  as  grace  be \npresent,  or  be  wanting/ p    He  agrees  entirely  with \nAugustine,  that  '  Freewill,  by  its  own  strength, \ncannot  but  fall ;   and  has  no  power,  save  to  com- \nmit sin/     On  which  account,  Augustine  says,  it \nshould  be  called  Bondwill,  rather  than  Freewill; \nin  his  second  book  against  Julian. \n\nBut  you  represent  the  power  of  Freewill  to  be \nequal  on  both  sides,  inasmuch  as  it  can,  by  its \nown  strength,  without  grace,  both  apply  itself  to, \nand  turn  away  itself  from  good.  You  are  not  aware \nhow  much  you  attribute  to  it  by  this  pronoun \n'  itself/  or  e  its  own  self/  whilst  you  say,  ?  it  can \napply  itself!

I  do  not  say  this  as  approving  the  sentence  of \n\nthe  Sophists  on  Freewill,  but  as  thinking  it  more \n\ntolerable  than  that  of  Erasmus ;  because  they \napproach  nearer  to  the  truth :  but  neither  do  they \naffirm,  as  I  do,  that  Freewill  is  a  mere  nothing. \nStill,  inasmuch  as  they  affirm  (the  Master  of  the \nSentences5  in  particular)  that  it  has  no  power  of \nitself  without  grace,  they  are  at  war  with  Eras- \nmus ;  nay,  they  seem  to  be  at  war  also  with  them- \nselves, and  to  be  torturing  one  another  with  dis- \nputes about  a  mere  word :  being  fonder  of  con- \ntention than  of  truth,  as  becometh  Sophists.  For, \nsuppose  a  Sophist  of  no  bad  sort  to  come  in  my \nway,  with  whom  I  were  holding  familiar  conversa- \ntion and  conference  upon  these  matters  in  a  corner; \nand  whose  candid  and  free  judgment  I  should  ask, \nin  some  such  way  as  this  :  '  If  any  one  should  pro- \nnounce that  free  to  you,  which,  by  its  own  power, \ncan  but  incline  to  one  side  (that  is,  to  the  bad \nside);  having  power,  it  is  true,  on  the  other  side \n(that  is,  on  the  good  side) — but  that,  by  a  virtue \nnot  its  own  ;  nay,  simply  by  the  help  of  another  : \ncould  you  refrain  from  laughing,  my  friend  ?'  For, \nupon  this  principle,  I  shall  easily  make  it  out  that \na  stone,  or  the  trunk  of  a  tree,  has  Freewill ;  as \nbeing  that  which  can  incline  both  upwards  and \ndownwards ;  by  its  own  power,  indeed,  only \ndownwards ;  yet,  by  another's  help,  and  by  that \nonly,  upwards  also.  And  thus,  as  I  have  before \nsaid,  by  an  inverted1  use  of  all  languages  and \nwords,  we  shall  at  length  come  to  say,  c  No  man \nis  all  men;'  c  nothing  is  every  thing:'  as  refer- \nring the   one  term  to   the    thing   itself,  and  the \n\ns  Master  &c.

But  I  would  answer \nbriefly,  in  your  own  words :  '  the  Scripture  is  ob- \nscure and  ambiguous  in  this  passage;'  it  there- \nfore proves  nothing  with  certainty  :  and,  main- \ntaining as  we  do  the  negative,  I  demand  of  you  to \nproduce  a  place  which  proves  what  Freewill  is, \nand  what  Freewill  can  effect,  by  clear  words. \nPerhaps  you  will  do  this  on  the  Greek  calends.a \nHowbeit,  to  avoid  this  necessity,  you  waste  many \ngood  words  in  marching  over  the  ears  of  corn,b \n\ny  The  Greek  text,  from  which  our  authorized  version  is  a \nfaithful  translation,  omits  the  words  '  conservabunt  te,'  and \n'  adjecit  mandata  et  prsecepta  sua.'

The \nopinion  of  those  who  maintain  that  Freewill  can \ndo  nothing  but  sin  ;  that  only  grace  works  good \nin  us ;  seems  still  more  harsh  to  you  :  but  most \nof  all,  that  opinion  which  affirms  Freewill  to  be  an \nempty  name,  God  working  both  good  and  evil  in \nus.

He  represents  him  as \nplaying  at  peep  with  the  learned  j  and  as  deceiving  the  people  by \nhis  tricks  upon  words,  by  which  he  gave  the  same  word  as \nmany  faces  as  Vertumnus.

For  you  have  said,  that  SEC- IX- \nFreewill  is  a  power  of  the  human  will,  by  which  a \nman  can  apply  himself  to  good.  But  here  you \nsay,  and  approve  its  being  said,  that  a  man  can- \nnot will  good,  without  grace.  Your  definition \naffirms  what  its  illustration  denies  ;  and  there  is \nfound  c  a  yea  and  nay 9  in  your  Freewill :  so  that \nyou  at  the  same  time  both  approve  and  condemn \nus;  nay,  condemn  and  approve  yourself,  in  one \nand  the  same  dogma  and  article.11  Do  you  not \nthink  it  good,  that  it  applies  itself  to  those  things \nwhich  pertain  to  everlasting  salvation?  This  is \nwhat  your  definition  attributes  to  Freewill;  and \nyet  there  is  no  need  of  grace,  if  there  be  so  much \nof  good  in  Freewill  that  it  can  apply  itself  to \ngood.  So  then,  the  Freewill  which  you  define,  is \na  different  thing  from  the  Freewill  which  you  de- \nfend ;  and  Erasmus  has  two  Free  wills  more  than \nothers  have,  and  those  quite  at  variance  with  each \nother. \n\nBut,  dismissing  that  Freewill  which  your  defini-  The  appro- \ntion  has  invented,  let  us  look  at  this  contrary  one,  nio/con- \nwhich  the  opinion  itself  sets  before  us.  You  grant,  sidered. \nthat  a  man  cannot  will  good  without  special  grace ; \nand  we  are  not  now  discussing  what  the  grace  of \nGod  can  do,  but  what  man  can  do  without  grace. \nYou  grant  therefore,  that  Freewill  cannot  will \ngood.  This  is  nothing  else,  than  that  it  cannot \napply  itself  to  those  things  which  appertain  to \neternal  salvation,  as  you  sung  out  in  your  defini- \ntion. Nay,  you  say  a  little  before,  that  the  hu- \nman will  is  so  depraved,  that,  having  lost  its \nliberty,  it  is  compelled  to  serve  sin,  and  cannot \nrestore  itself  to  any  better  sort  of  produce.  If  I \ndo  not  mistake,  you  represent  the  Pelagians  to \nhave  been  of  this  opinion. — Now,  I  think  there  is \nno  escape  here  for  my  Proteus.     He  is  caught  and \n\nh  The  definition  says,  e can  apply  itself  to  those  things,  &c.' \nThe  approvable  opinion  says, f  cannot  will  good.' \n\n\n144  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  held  by  open  words ;  to  wit,  the  will,  having  lost \n\nits  liberty,  is  driven  into,  and  held  fast  in,  the  ser- \nvice of  sin.  O  exquisite  Freewill  which,  having \nlost  its  freedom,  is  declared  by  Erasmus  himself  to \nbe  the  servant  of  sin!  When  Luther  said  this, \nc  nothing  had  ever  been  heard  that  is  more  ab- \nsurd;' 'nothing  could  be  published  that  is  more \nmischievous  than  this  paradox/  Diatribes  must \nbe  written  against  him  ! \n\nBut  perhaps  nobody  will  take  my  word  for  it, \nthat  Erasmus  has  really  said  these  things :  let \nthis  passage  of  Diatribe  be  read,  and  it  will  excite \nwonder.  Not  that  I  am  greatly  surprised.  The \nman  who  does  not  account  this  a  serious  subject, \nand  is  never  affected  with  the  cause  he  is  pleading, \nbut  is  altogether  alienated  from  it  in  heart,  and  is \ntired  of  it,  and  chills  under  it,  or  nauseates  it — how \ncan  such  an  one  do  otherwise  than  here  and  there \nsay  absurd  things,  incongruous  things,  discordant \nthings?  pleading  the  cause  as  he  does,  like  a \ndrunken  or  sleeping  man,  who  belches  out  '  yes/ \nc  no/  as  the  sounds  fall  variously  upon  his  ears. \nIt  is  on  this  account,  that  rhetoricians  require  feel- \ning in  an  advocate ;  and  much  more  does  theology \nrequire  such  a  degree  of  emotion  in  her  champion, \nas  shall  render  him  vigilant,  sharpsighted,  intent, \nthoughtful,  and  strenuous. \nsect.  x.       If  then  Freewill,  without  grace,  having  lost  her \n\nfreedom,  is  obliged  to  serve  sin,  and  cannot  will \n\nvabieoPi-\"  &°°d  >  ^  should  like  to  know  what  that  desire, \nnionfur-  what  that  endeavour  is,  which  this  first  and  appro- \nver c°«-    Vable  opinion  leaves  to  a  man? i  It  cannot  be  good \n\ndesire,  it  cannot  be  good  endeavour :  because  he \ncannot  will  good ;  as  the  opinion  says,  and  as  you \nhave  conceded.  Evil  desire,  therefore,  and  evil \nendeavour  are  alone  left ;  which,  now  that  liberty \nis  lost,  are  compelled  to  serve  sin. — And  what  is \nmeant,  pray,  by  that  saying  'This  opinion  leaves \n\n1  ( It  leaves  man  in  possession  of  desire  and  endeavour/  &c. \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  145 \n\ndesire  and  endeavour,  but  leaves  not  that  which    sec.  xi. \n\nmay  be  ascribed  to  the  man's  own  powers  V  Who  \n\ncan  conceive  this  ?  If  desire  and  endeavour  be \nleft  to  Freewill,  why  should  they  not  be  ascribed \nto  it  ?  If  they  are  not  to  be  ascribed,  how  can \nthey  be  left?  Are  this  desire  and  endeavour, \nwhich  subsist  before  grace,  left  even  to  that  \\ery \ngrace  which  is  to  come,  and  not  to  Freewill ;  so \nas  to  be  at  the  same  time  left,  and  not  left,  to  this \nsame  Freewill?  If  these  be  not  paradoxes,  or \nrather  monsters,  I  know  not  what  monsters  are. \n\nBut  perhaps  Diatribe  is  dreaming,  that  there  is  Freewill \na  something  between  this  being  able  to  will  good,  not 'ane- \nand  not  being  able  to  will  good,  which  is  the  mere  f^-mediate \npower  of  willing ;  distinct  from  any  regard  to  good  power  of \nor  evil.     Thus,  Ave  are  to  evade  the  rocks  by  a  the  wllL> \nsort  of  logical  subtilty ;  affirming,  that  there  is,  in \nthe  will  of  man,  a  certain  power  of  willing,  which \ncannot  indeed  incline  to  good  without  grace,  and \nyet  even  without  grace  does  not  forthwith  will \nonly  evil :  a  pure  and  simple  power  of  willing; \nwhich  may  be  turned  by  grace  upwards  to  good, \nand  by  sin  downwards  to  evil.     But  what   then \nbecomes  of  that  saying,  c  having  lost  its  liberty, \nit  is  compelled  to  serve   sin  V     Where  then  is \nthat    '  desire    and    endeavour'    which    is    left? \nWhere  is  that  power  of  applying  itself  to  those \nthings  which  belong  to  eternal  salvation  ?   For  that \npower  of  applying  itself  to  salvation  cannot  be  a \nmere  abstract  power  of  willing,  unless  salvation \nitself  be  called  nothing. — Then,  again,  desire  and \nendeavour  cannot  be  a  mere  power  of  willing; \nsince    desire    must    lean    and    endeavour    some \nwhither,  and  cannot  be  carried  towards  nothing, \nor  remain  quiescent.     In    sliort,    whithersoever \nDiatribe  shall  be  pleased  to  turn  herself,  she  can- \nnot escape  contradictions,  and  conflicting  expres- \nsions :  so  that  even  Freewill  herself  is  not  so  much \na  captive,  as  Diatribe  who  defends  her.   She  so  en- \ntangles herself,  in  her  attempts  to  give  liberty  to \n\n\n146  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  the  will,  that  she  gets  bound   with   indissoluble \n\n'  chains,  in  company  with  her  freedmaid. \n\nThen,  again,  it  is  a  mere  fiction  of  logic,  that \nthere  is  this   middle  faculty  of  mere  willing  in \nman  ;  nor  can  those  prove,  who  assert  it.     Igno- \nrance of  things,  and  servile  regard  to  words,  has \ngiven   birth   to  this  fancy;  as    if  the  will    must \nstraightway  be  such  in  substance,  as  we  set  it  out \nin   words.     The   Sophists   have   numberless   fig- \nments of  this   sort.     The   truth   rather  is,  what \nChrist  says,  u  He  that  is  not  with  me  is  against \nme.\"     He  does  not  say,  c  He  that  is  not  with  me, \nnor  against  me,  but  in  the  middle/     For,  if  God \nbe  in  us,  Satan  is  absent,  and  only  to  will  good  is \npresent  with  us.     If  God  be  absent,  Satan  is  pre- \nsent, and  there  is  no  will  in  us  but  towards  evil. \nNeither  God,  nor  Satan,  allows  a  mere  abstract \npower  to  will  in  us ;  but,  as  you  have  rightly  said, \nhaving  lost  our  liberty,  we  are  compelled  to  serve \nsin  •  that  is,  we  will  sin  and  wickedness ;  we  speak \nsin  and  wickedness ;  we  act  sin  and  wickedness. \nSee  into  what  a  corner  Diatribe  has  been  driven, \nwithout  knowing  it,  by  invincible  and  most  mighty \ntruth  \\  who  has  made  her  wisdom  folly,  and  com- \npelled her,  when  meaning  to  speak  against  us,  to \nspeak  for  us,  and  against  herself:  just  as  Free- \nwill does,  when  she  attempts  any  thing  good ;  for \nthen,  by  opposing  evil,  she  most  of  all  does  evil, \nand  opposes  good.    Thus  Diatribe  is  much  such  a \nspeaker,  as   Freewill   is   an   actor.     Indeed,   the \nwhole  Diatribe  itself  is  nothing  else  but  an  ex- \ncellent performance  of  Freewill,   condemning  by \ndefending,  and  defending  by  condemning  ;k  that  is, \ntwice  a  fool,  whilst  she  would  be  thought  wise. \nsec.  xn.       rpj^  £rs{-  opinion,  then,  as  compared  with  itself, \nTh  is  such  as  to  deny  that  man  can  will  any  thing \n\nprovable     good,  and  yet  to  maintain  that  desire  is  left  to  him; \n\nk  f  Not  only  ruining  her  own  cause,  but  establishing  her \nadversary's/ \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  ]47 \n\nand  yet  that  this  desire  also  is  not  his.     Let  us  sec.  xii. \n\nnow  compare  it  with  the  other  two. — (  The  second  \n\nis  harsher,   which  judges   that   Freewill   has    no  °Pinion  , \n\n,      /     .  9     Tp  m,  .         ,  .      compared \n\npower  but   to   commit   sin/     I  ins,    however,    is  with  the \nAugustine's   opinion ;  expressed   in  many   other  other  two- \nplaces,  and  specially  in  his  treatise  on  the  Letter \nand  Spirit  (the  fourth  or  fifth  chapter,  if  I  am  not \nmistaken),  where  he  uses  these  very  words. \n\nf  That  third  opinion  is  the  harshest  of  all,  which \nmaintains  that  Freewill  is  an  empty  name,  and  that \nall  we  do  is  necessarily  under  the  bondage  of  sin/ \nDiatribe   wages    war   with  these   two.     Here,  I \nadmit  that  probably  I  may  not  be  German  enough, \nor  Latinist  enough,  to  enunciate  the  subject  matter \nperspicuously;  but  I  call  God  to  witness,  that  I \nmeant  to  say  nothing  else,  and  nothing  else  to  be \nunderstood,  by  the  expressions  used  in  these  two \nlast  opinions,  than  what  is  asserted  in  the  first \nopinion.     Nor  did  Augustine,  I  think,  mean  any \nthing  else ;  nor  do  I  understand  by  his  words  any \nthing  else,  than  what  the  first  opinion  asserts.    So \nthat  the  three  opinions  recited  by  Diatribe  are,  in \nmy  view,  but  that  one  sentiment,  which  I  have \npromulgated.     For,   when  it  has  been  conceded \nand  settled,  that  Freewill,  having  lost  her  freedom, \nis  compelled  into  the  service  of  sin,  and  has  no \npower  to  will  any  thing  good;  I  can  conceive  no- \nthing else  from  these  expressions,  but  that  Free- \nwill is  a  bare  word ;  the  substance  expressed  by \nthat  word  having  been  lost.     Lost  liberty  my  art \nof  grammar  calls  no  liberty  at  all ;  and  to  attri- \nbute the  name  of  liberty  to  that  wrhich  has  no \nliberty,   is   to  attribute  a  bare  name  to  it.     If  I \nwander  from  truth  here,  let  who  can  recal   me \nfrom  my  wanderings  ;  if  my  words   be   obscure \nand  ambiguous,  let  who  can  make  them  plain,  and \nconfirm  them.     I  cannot  call  lost  health,  health ; \nand  if  I  should  ascribe  such  a  property  to  a  sick \nman,  what  have  I  given  him  but  a  bare  name  ? \nBut  away  with  such  monstrous  expressions  ! \nl2 \n\n\n148 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

      "content": "Ecclesias- \nticus  xv. \nJ  4—1  Pre- \nsumed, and \nexpounded. \n\n\nFor,  who  can  bear  that  abuse  of  language,  by \nwhich  we  affirm  that  man  has  Freewill;  yet,  with \nthe  same  breath,  assert  that  he  has  lost  his  liberty, \nand  is  compelled  into  the  service  of  sin,  and  can \nwill  nothing  good.  Such  expressions  are  at  vari- \nance with  common  sense,  and  absolutely  destroy \nthe  use  of  speech.  Diatribe  is  to  be  accused, \nrather  than  we ;  she  blurts  out  her  own  words  as \nif  she  were  asleep,  and  gives  no  heed  to  what  is \nspoken  by  others.  She  does  not  consider,  I  say, \nwhat  it  is,  and  of  what  force  it  is,  to  declare  that \nman  has  lost  his  liberty,  is  compelled  to  serve  sin, \nand  has  no  power  to  do  any  thing  good.  For,  if \nshe  were  awake  and  observant,  she  would  clearly \nsee  that  the  meaning  of  the  three  opinions,  which \nshe  makes  diverse  and  opposite,  is  one  and  the \nsame.  For  the  man  who  has  lost  his  liberty,  who \nis  compelled  to  serve  sin,  and  who  cannot  will \ngood — what  shall  be  inferred  more  correctly  con- \ncerning this  man,  than  that  he  does  nothing  but \nsin,  or  will  evil  ?  Even  the  Sophists  would \nestablish  this  conclusion  by  their  learned  syllo- \ngisms. So  that  Madam  Diatribe  is  very  unfor- \ntunate in  entering  the  lists  with  these  two  last \nopinions,  whilst  she  approves  the  first,  which  is \nthe  same  with  them  ;  again,  as  her  manner  is, \ncondemning  herself,  and  expressing  approbation \nof  my  sentiments,  in  one  and  the  same  article. \n\nLet  us  now  return  to  the  passage  in  Ecclesias- \nticus;  comparing  that  first  opinion,  which  you  de- \nclare to  be  appro vable,  with  it  also,  as  we  have \nnow  done  wdth  the  other  two.  The  opinion  says, \n6  Freewill  cannot  will  good/  The  passage  from \nEcclesiasticus  is  cited  to  prove,  that  '  Freewill  is \nnothing,  and  can  do  nothing/  The  opinion  which \nis  to  be  confirmed  by  Ecclesiasticus,  then,  de- \nclares one  thing,  and  the  passage  from  Eccle- \nsiasticus is  alleged  to  confirm  another.  As  if  a \nman,  going  to  prove  that  Christ  is  Messias,  should \nadduce   a  passage    which   proves   that   Pontius \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  149 \n\nPilate  was  Governor  of  S)Tia;  or  something  else,  sec.xiii. \n\nwhich  is  as  wide  from  it  as  the  extreme  notes  of  the  \n\ndouble  octave.1  Just  such  is  your  proof  of  Free- \nwill here  :  not  to  mention,  what  I  have  dispatched \nalready,  that  nothing  is  here  clearly  and  certainly  , \naffirmed,  or  proved,  as  to  what  Freewill  is,  and  can \ndo.  But  it  is  worth  while  to  examine  this  whole \npassage. \n\nIn  the  first  place,  he  says,  c  God  made  man  in \nthe  beginning.'  Here  he  speaks  of  the  creation \nof  man,  and  says  nothing,  hitherto,  either  about \nFreewill,  or  about  precepts. \n\nIt  follows  ;  '  and  left  him  in  the  hand  of  his  own \ncounsel/  What  have  we  here  ?  Is  Freewill \nerected  here?  Not  even  here  is  any  mention \nmade  of  precepts,  for  which  Freewill  is  required; \nnor  do  we  read  a  syllable  on  this  subject,  in  the  his- \ntory of  the  creation  of  man.  If  any  thing  be  meant, \ntherefore,  by  the  words  c  in  the  hand  of  his \ncounsel,'  it  must  rather  be,  what  we  read  in  the \nfirst  and  second  chapters  of  Genesis  :  c  Man  was \nappointed  lord  of  the  things  which  were  made,  so \nas  to  have  a  free  dominion  over  them;'  as  Moses \nsays,  \"Let  us  make  man,  and  let  him  have  domi- \nnion over  the  fishes  of  the  sea,  &c.\"  Nor  can \nany  thing  else  be  proved  from  these  words.  For \nin  that  state,  man  had  power  to  deal  with  the \ncreatures  according  to  his  own  will,  they  being \nmade  his  subjects;  and  he  calls  this  man's  coun- \nsel, in  opposition  to  God's  counsel.  But  after \nthis,  when  now  he  has  declared  man  to  have  been \nthus  constituted  the  ruler,  and  to  have  been  left \nin  the  hand  of  his  own  counsel ;  he  goes  on, \n\n\"  He  added  his  own  commands  and  precepts.\" \nTo  what  did  he  add  them  ?  Why,  to  the  counsel \nand  will  of  man ;  and  over  and  above  that  esta- \nblishment of  the  dominion  of  man  over  the  rest  of \n\n1  Quod  disdlapason  conveniaf]     A  Greek   proverb,   denoting \nthe  greatest  possible  dissimilitude. \n\n\n150  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  the  creatures.  By  these  precepts,  he  took  away \nfrom  man  the  dominion  over  one  part  of  his  crea- \ntures (the  tree  of  the  knowledge  of  good  and  evil, \nfor  instance),  and  rather  willed  that  it  should  not \nbe  free.  Having  mentioned  the  adding  of  pre- \ncepts, he  next  comes  to  man's  will  towards  God, \nand  the  things  of  God. \n\n\"  If  thou  shalt  be  willing  to  keep  the  command- \nments, they  shall  preserve  thee,  &c.\"  From  this \nplace,  then,  £  if  thou  slmlt  be  willing/  the  ques- \ntion about  Freewill  begins.  So  that  we  may \nlearn  from  the  Preacher,  that  man  is  divided  be- \ntween two  kingdoms ;  in  the  one  of  which,  he  is \nborne  along  by  his  own  will  and  counsel,  without \nany  precepts  or  commandments  from  God;  to \nwit,  in  the  exercise  of  his  relations  to  the  inferior \ncreatures.  Here  he  reigns,  and  is  lord,  as  having \nbeen  left  in  the  hand  of  his  own  counsel.  Not \nthat  God  so  leaves  him,  even  here,  as  not  to  co- \noperate with  him  in  all  things  ;  but  that  he  leaves \nhim  a  free  use  of  the  creatures,  according  to  his \nown  will,  not  restricting  him  by  laws  or  injunc- \ntions. Just  as  if  you  should  say,  by  way  of  com- \nparison, '  The  Gospel  has  left  us  in  the  hand  of \nour  own  counsel,  to  rule  over  the  creatures,  and \nuse  them  as  we  please ;  but  Moses  and  the  Pope \nhave  not  left  us  in  this  counsel,  but  have  re- \nstrained us  by  laws,  and  have  rather  subjected  us \nto  their  wills/ — But  in  the  other  kingdom,  man \nis  not  left  in  the  hand  of  his  own  counsel,  but  is \nborne  along,  and  led  by  the  will  and  counsel  of \nGod.  So  that,  as  in  his  own  kingdom,  lie  is  borne \nalong  by  his  own  will,  without  the  precepts  of \nanother  ;  so,  in  the  kingdom  of  God,  he  is  borne \nalong  by  the  precepts  of  another,  without  his  own \nwill.  And  this  is  what  the  Preacher  affirms, \n\"  He  added  precepts  and  commands  ;  If  thou \nwilt,  &C.  &LC.\"  m \n\nm  I  object  to  this  distinction,,  as  I  have  already  done  to  the \nsame  in  substance  (Part  ii.  Sect,  xxi.);   nor  can  I  believe  it  to \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  151 \n\nIf  these  things  then  be  quite  clear,  we  have  sec.xiv. \n\nproved    that    this    passage    from    Ecclesiasticus  ; — \n\nmakes  against  Freewill,  not  for  it ;  as  subjecting  ^ulTt^\" \nman  to  the  precepts  and  will  of  God,  and  with-  least  does \ndrawing  him  from  his  own  will.     But  if  they  be  j?ot  decide \nnot  quite  clear,  I  have  at  least  made  out,   that  wni.  * \nthis  passage  cannot  be  brought  to  support  Free- \nwill, as  being  capable  of  quite  a  different  interpre- \ntation from  theirs :  such,  for  instance,  as  I  have \njust  mentioned ;  which  is  so  far  from  being  ab- \nsurd, that  it  is  most  sound,  and  is  consonant  to \nthe  whole  tenour  of  Scripture  :  whereas  theirs  is \nrepugnant  to  that  testimony,  and  is  fetched  from \nthis  single  passage,  in  contradiction  to  the  whole \nvolume  besides.    We  stand  firm,  and  without  fear, \ntherefore,  in  our  good  sense  of  the  words,  which \n\nhave  been  in  the  mind  of  the  Apocryphal  writer.  Man  had \nnot  Freewill  given  to  him,  in  the  exercise  of  one  set  of  his  rela- \ntions (those  to  the  creatures,  for  instance),  more  than  in  another. \nDominion  and  superiority  did  not  confer  Freewill.  He  was,  in \nreality,  made  accountable  for  his  use  of  the  creatures  ;  they  were \nnot  given  to  him  to  do  what  he  pleased  with.  But,  if  it  had \nbeen  so,  this  would  not  have  prevented  his  liability  to  have  his \nwill  moved  by  a  power  without  him.  Insubjection  and  unac- \ncountableness  are  of  a  perfectly  different  nature  from  Freewill. \nA  despot  may  be  ruled  within,  as  well  as  a  slave.  But,  taking \nthe  writer  to  mean  that  he  was  left  to  do  his  own  will — this \ndoes  not  necessarily  imply  more  than  that  he  was  left  a  free \nagent  :  and  this  he  was  left,  with  respect  to  all  his  relations, \nhigher  as  well  as  inferior  :  and  so  are  we.  The  difference  be- \ntween Adam's  state  before  his  fall,  and  ours  who  have  been  be- \ngotten out  of  him  since — after  having  fallen  in  and  with  him — \nconsisteth  not  in  his  having  been  any  way  independent  of \nGod — which  we  are  not — or  having  had  a  will  that  was  inac- \ncessible to  divine  control — which  we  have  not — but  only  in \nhis  ignorance  of,  and  freedom  from  evil.  He  knew  only \ngood,  and  the  devil  had  as  yet  no  part  in  him.

The  verb  is  in  the  conjunctive \nmood  (*  If  thou  wilt');  which  asserts  nothing  indi- \ncatively.  Take  an  example  or  two.  '  If  the \ndevil  be  God,  he  is  worthy  to  be  worshipped/ \n<  If  an  ass  fly,  he  has  wings/  c  If  the  will  be  free, \ngrace  is  nothing/  The  Preacher  should  have \nspoken  thus,  if  he  had  meant  to  assert  the  freedom \nof  the  will :  c  Man  can  keep  the  commandments  of \nGod;'  or,  'Man  has  power  to  keep  the  command- \nments/ \n\nBut  here  Diatribe  will  cavil,  that  c  the  Preacher, \nin  saying  \"  If  thou  wilt  keep,\"  intimates  that  there \nis  a  will  in  man  to  keep,  and  not  to  keep ;  for \nwhat  meaning  is  there,  in  saying  to  a  man  who \nhas  no  will,  'If  thou  wilt/  YVould  it  not  be \nridiculous  to  say  to  a  man  that  is  blind,  ( If \nthou  wilt  see,  thou  shalt  find  a  treasure  V  or  to  a \ndeaf  man,  c If  thou  wilt  hear,  I  will  tell  thee  a \npretty  story?'  This  would  be  only  laughing  at \ntheir  misery. \n\nI  answer ;  these  are  the  arguments  of  human \nreason,  who  is  wont  to  pour  out  a  flood  of  such \nwise  sayings :  so  that  I  have  not  now  to  dispute \nwith  the  Preacher,  but  with  human  reason,  about \nan  inference.11  That  lady  interprets  the  Scriptures \nof  God  by  her  own  consequences  and  syllogisms  ; \ndrawing  them  whither  she  will.

She  measures  the  things  and  words  of  God, \nthen,  by  the  things  and  usage  of  men.  What  can \nbe  more  perverse  than  this ;  when  the  one  sort  of \nthings  is  earthly,  and  the  other  heavenly?  Thus \nshe  betrays  her  foolish  self;  how  she  thinks \nnothing,  but  what  is  human,  of  God. \n\nBut  what  if  I  should  prove,  that  the  nature  of \nwords  and  custom  of  speech,  even  amongst  men, \nis  not  always  such  as  to  make  those  persons \nobjects  of  ridicule,  who  have  no  power  to  comply \nwith  the  demand,  as  often  as  it  is  said  to  them, \n'  If  thou  wilt/  '  if  thou  wilt  do/  '  if  thou  wilt \nhear  ?-  How  often  do  parents  mock  their  chil- \ndren, by  bidding  them  come  to  them,  or  do  this  or \nthat,  for  the  mere  purpose  of  making  it  appear \nhow  utterly  incapable  they  are  of  doing  so,  and \nof  forcing  them  to  call  upon  the  parent  for  his \nhelping  hand  !  How  often  does  the  faithful  phy- \nsician command  his  proud  patient  to  do  or  leave \nundone  things  which  are  either  impossible,  or \nnoxious,  that  he  may  drive  him  to  that  knowledge \nof  his  disease,  or  of  his  weakness,  through  making \ntrial  of  himself,  to  which  he  could  not  lead  him \nby  any  other  means  !  What  is  more  frequent, \nor  more  common,  than  words  of  insult  and  pro- \nvocation, if  we  would  shew,  either  to  friends  or  to \nenemies,  what  they  can  do,  and  what  they  cannot \ndo?  I  mention  these  things,  only  by  way  of  ma- \nnifesting to  human  reason,  how  foolish  she  is  in \nattaching  her  inferences  to  the  Scriptures;  and \nhow  blind  she  is,  not  to  see  that  these  inferences \nare  not  always  realized,  even  in  human  words \n\n\n154  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  and  actions  :  yet,  if  she  but  see  them  fulfilled  now \n~~  and  then,  presently  she  rushes  forwards  with  pre- \ncipitation, and  pronounces  that  they  take  place \ngenerally,  in  all  human  and  divine  forms  of  speech. \nThus  she  contrives  to  make  an  universal  of  a  par- \nticular, as  the  manner  of  her  wisdom  is. \nsec. xvi.      Now,  if  God  deal  with  us  as  a  father  with  his \n\nchilden,  to  shew  us  our  impotency,   of  which  we \n\nsuch  forms  are  ignorant ;  or  as  a  faithful  physician,  to  make \nof  address,  our  disease  known  to  us  ;  or  if  he  insult  us,  as  his \nenemies,  who  proudly  resist  his  counsel,  and  by \nproposing  laws  to  us  (which  is  the  most  con- \nvincing way  of  doing  it),  say,  '  Do,  hear,  keep;' \nor,  ( if  thou  shalt  hear,  if  thou  shalt  be  willing,  if \nthou  shalt  do;'  will  it  be  a  just  inference  from \nhence,  '  So  then  we  can  will  freely,  else  God  is \nmocking  us  ?'  Is  not  this  rather  the  inference, \n6  So  then  God  is  making  trial  of  us,  whether  we \nbe  friends  or  foes ;  that,  if  we  be  his  friends,  he \nmay  lead  us  to  the  knowledge  of  our  impotency, \nby  the  law;  or,  if  we  be  proud  enemies,  then \nindeed  he  may  truly  and  deservedly  insult  and \nderide  us.'0  This  is  the  reason  why  God  gives \nlaws ;  as  Paul  teaches. p  For  human  nature  is  so \nblind  as  not  to  know  its  own  strength,  or  rather \nits  own  disease ;  and  is,  besides,  so  proud  as  to \nthink  that  it  knows  and  can  do  all  things.  Now, \nGod  has  not  any  more  effectual  remedy  for  this \n\n°  It  is  not  Luther's  business  to  state  whence  this  difference \nof  reception  arises  ;  which  is  only  through  the  free  favour  of \nGod,  making  some  to  be  his  friends,  by  his  Spirit  working  in \ndue  season,  whilst  he  leaves  others  in  their  native  enmity. \nLuther  would  not  hesitate  to  assign  this  cause ;  but  he  has \nhere  only  to  do  with  the  fact,  that  the  Lord  tries  and  evinces \nthese  different  characters  of  men,  by  such  calls  to  obedience. \n\np  \"  Therefore  by  the  deeds  of  the  law  there  shall  no  flesh \nbe  justified  in  his  sight ;  for  by  the  law  is  the  knowledge \nof  sin.\"  (Rom.  iii.  20.)

Let  it  suffice  to  have  taken  but  a  sip  of \nthe  cup  here,  that  I  might  confute  this  inference \nof  foolish,  carnal  wisdom,  '  If  thou  wilt — therefore \nthe  will  is  free/  Diatribe  dreams  that  man  is \nsound  and  whole;  just  such  as  he  is  in  the  sight \nof  his  fellow  men,  in  mere  human  affairs.  Hence \nit  is,  that  she  cavils  and  says,  c  Man  is  mocked  by \nsuch  words  as  <  if  thou  wilt/  c  if  thou  wilt  do/ \nc  if  thou  wilt  hear/  except  his  will  be  free/  But \nScripture  declares  man  to  be  corrupt  and  captive  ; \nand  not  only  so,  but  a  proud  despiser  of  God,  and \none  ignorant  of  his  corruption  and  captivity.  So \nshe  plucks  him  by  the  sleeve,  and  endeavours  to \nawaken  him  by  such  words  as  these,  that  he  may \nown,  even  by  sure  experience,  how  incapable  he \nis  of  any  of  these  things. \n\nBut  I  will  become  the  assailant  nryself  in  this  Diatribe \nconflict;  and  will  ask,  '  If  thou  dost  indeed  think,  jjj8™^ \nMadam  Reason,  that  these  inferences  stand  good  (if  ference. \nthou  wilt — therefore  thou  canst  will  freely),  why  dost \nthou  not  follow  them  ?  Thou  sayest,  in  that  approv- \nable  opinion  of  thine,  that  Freewill  cannot  will  any \nthing  good.  By  what  sort  of  inference,  then,  will  it \nat  the  same  time  flow,  as  you  say  it  does,  from  this \npassage, '  If  thou  shalt  be  willing  to  keep/  that  man \ncan  will  freely,  and  cannot  will  freely  ?  Do  sweet \nwater  and  bitter  flow  from  the  same  fountain  ? \nAre  you  not,  even  yourself,  the  greater  mocker \nof  man  here;  when  you  say  that  he  is  able  to  keep \nwhat  he  cannot  even  wrill,  or  wish  ?  It  follows \ntherefore,  that  neither  do  you  on  your  part  think \nit  a  good  inference,  '  If  thou  wilt — therefore  thou \ncanst  will  freely/  though  you  maintain  it  so  vehe- \nmently :  or  else,  you  do  not,  from  your  heart, \naffirm  that  opinion  to  be  ap provable,  which  main- \ntains that  man  cannot  will  good/ — Reason  is  so \nentrapped  in  the  inferences  and  words  of  her  own \nwisdom,  as  not  to  know  what  she  says,  or  what \n\n\n156  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  she  is  talking-  about.  Unless  it  be  (as  is  indeed \nmost  worthy  of  her),  that  Freewill  can  only  be \ndefended  by  such  arguments  as  mutually  devour \nand  make  an  end  of  each  other  :  just  as  the  Midi- \nanites  destroyed  themselves,  by  a  mutual  slaugh- \nter, whilst  making  war  against  Gideon  and  the \npeople  of  God. \nProves  But  let  me  expostulate,  still  more  at  large,  with \n\ntoo  much.  this  wise  Diatribe.  The  Preacher  does  not  say, \n*  If  thou  shalt  have  a  desire  or  endeavour  to  keep, \nwhich  is,  nevertheless,  not  to  be  ascribed  to  thine \njwn  powers;'  as  you  collect  from  his  words;  but \n6  If  thou  wilt  keep  the  commandments,  they  shall \npreserve  thee/  Now,  if  we  would  draw  infer- \nences, such  as  you  in  your  wisdom  are  wont  to  do, \nwe  shall  infer,  *  therefore  man  can  keep  the  com- \nmandments :'  and  thus,  we  shall  leave  not  only  a \nlittle  bit  of  a  desire,  or  a  sort  of  endeavourling,  in \nman;  but  shall  ascribe  to  him  the  whole  fulness \nand  abundance  of  power  to  keep  the  command- \nments. Else,  the  Preacher  would  be  mocking  the \nmisery  of  man,  by  commanding  him  to  keep,  when \nhe  knew  him  to  be  unable  to  keep.  Nor  would  it \nbe  enough,  that  he  should  have  desire  and  endea- \nvour:, not  even  thus  would  the  Preacher  escape \nthe  suspicion  of  using  mockery;  he  must  inti- \nmate that  he  has  in  him  a  power  of  keeping. \nConfirms  _gut  let  us  suppose  this  desire  and  endeavour \nism?Sian\"  °f  Freewill  to  be  something.  What  shall  we  say \nto  those  (the  Pelagians,  I  mean)  who,  from  this \npassage,  were  used  to  deny  grace  altogether,  and \nto  ascribe  every  thing  to  Freewill  ?  Without \ndoubt,  the  Pelagians  have  gained  the  victory,  if \nDiatribe's  consequence  be  allowed.  For  the \nwords  of  the  Preacher  import  keeping,  and  not \nmerely  desiring  or  endeavouring.  Now,  if  you \nshall  deny  to  the  Pelagians  the  inference  of  *  keep- \ning;' they  will,  in  their  turn,  much  more  properly \ndeny  to  you  the  inference  of  c endeavouring  :9  and, \nif  you  take  away  complete  Freewill  from  them, \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  157 \n\nthey  will  take  from  you  that  little  particle  of  it  sc.  xvn. \n\nwhich   you    say   remains;    not   allowing  you   to  \n\nclaim  for  a  particle,  what  you  have  denied  to  the \nwhole  substance.  So  that,  whatever  you  urge \nagainst  the  Pelagians,  who  ascribe  a  whole  to \nFreewill  from  this  passage,  will  come  much  more \nforcibly  from  us,  in  contradiction  to  that  little  bit \nof  a  desire  which  constitutes  your  Freewill. q  The \nPelagians  too  will  so  far  agree  with  us  as  to  ad- \nmit, that,  if  their  opinion  cannot  be  proved  from \nthis  passage,  much  less  can  any  other  be  proved \nfrom  it :  since,  if  the  cause  is  to  be  pleaded  by \ninferences,  the  Preacher  makes  the  most  strongly \nof  all  for  the  Pelagians;  forasmuch  as  he  speaks \nexpressly  of  entire  keeping.  6  If  thou  wilt  keep \nthe  commandments/  Nay,  he  speaks  of  faith  also  : \n'  If  thou  wilt  keep  acceptable  faith/  So  that,  by \nthe  same  inference,  we  ought  to  have  it  in  our \npower  to  keep  faith  also  :  howbeit,  this  faith  is \nthe  alone  and  rare  gift  of  God;  as  Paul  says/ \n\nIn  short,  since  so  many  opinions  are  enumerated \nin  support  of  Freewill,  and  there  is  not  one  of \nthem  but  what  seizes  upon  this  passage  of  Eccle- \nsiasticus  for  itself,  yet  those  opinions  are  different \nand  contrary  ;  it  must  follow,  that  they  deem  the \nPreacher  contradictory  and  opposite,  each  to  the \nother  severally,    in  the  self-same  words.      They \n\ni  Totum  Uhero  arbitrio  tribuentibus.']  The  Pelagians  spake \nmore  wisely  than  many  who  oppose  them.  They  maintained \n1  the  integrity  of  Freewill  ;'  an  absolute  power  of  willing  good. \nFreewill  is  Freewill ;  and,  if  there  be  any  thing  of  it  in  man, \nthere  is  the  whole  of  it. \n\nr  Luther  refers,  no  doubt,  to  Ephes.  ii.  8.  Ci  For  by  grace \nare  ye  saved  through  faith  ;  and  that  not  of  yourselves  :  it  is \nthe  gift  of  God.\"  His  interpretation,  if  I  understand  the  text \naright,  is  incorrect  :  it  is  not  'faith'  that  is  spoken  of  as  the  gift \nof  God,  but  'his  whole  salvation.'  The  truth  of  his  affirma- \ntion, however,  though  not  fairly  deducible  from  this  text, \nis  unquestionable  ;  and  may  be  shewn,  as  well  from  particular \ntestimonies,  as  from  the  general  tenour  of  Scripture.

Still,  if \nthat  inference  be  admitted,  he  makes  for  the  Pela- \ngians only,  against  all  the  rest :  and  so  makes \nagainst  Diatribe  5  who  cuts  her  own  throat  here.8 \n\nBut  I  renew  my  first  assertion;  viz.  that  this \npassage  from  Ecclesiasticus  patronises  none  ab- \nsolutely of  those  who  maintain  Freewill ;  but \nopposes  them  all.  For  that  inference,  c  if  thou \nwilt — therefore  thou  canst/  is  inadmissible;  and \nthe  true  understanding  of  such  passages  as  these \nis,  that,  by  this  word  and  the  like,  man  is  warned \nof  his  impotency ;  which,  as  being  ignorant  and \nproud,  if  it  were  not  for  these  divine  warnings, \nhe  would  neither  own  nor  feel. \n\nAnd  here  I  speak,  not  of  the  first  man  only,  but \nof  any  man,  and  every  man;  though  it  be  of  little \nconsequence,  whether  you  understand  it  of  the \nfirst  man,  or  of  any  other  whatsoever.  For,  al- \nthough the  first  man  was  not  impotent  through  the \npresence  of  grace;  still  God  shews  him  abun- \ndantly by  this  precept,  how  impotent. he  would  be \nin  the  absence  of  grace.  Now  if  that  man,  hav- \ning the  Spirit/  was  not  able  to  will  good ;  that  is, \n\ns  Suo  ipsius  gladio  jugulatur.*\\     By  quoting   a  passage   for \nherself,  which  directly  contradicts  her. \n\n1  Cum  adesset  Spiritus.~\\  Luther  assumes  that  Adam,  in  his \ncreation  state,  had  the  Spirit ;  of  which  there  is  no  proof,  and \nthe  contrary  seems  evidently  to  have  been  the  fact.  Made  per- \nfect after  his  kind,  it  was  no  part  of  his  creation  dues  or  gifts \nto  have  the  Spirit.  He  was  formed  to  glorify  God,  as  his \ncreature  :  which  implies  a  substance  distinct  from,  and  exist- \ning in  a  state  of  severance  from  his  Creator  ;  like  a  piece  of \nmechanism  put  out  of  the  hand  of  its  artificer.  He  was  left \nto  himself,  therefore,  having  his  own  high  moral  powers  and \nacquirements,  but  no  extrinsic  aid ;  to  make  trial  and  to  shew, \nwhat  man  in  his  entireness  is,  and  wrhat  he  would  become \nthrough  temptation,  if  not  inhabited  by  his  Creator.  This  trial \nand  manifestation  would  furnish  an  inference  with  respect  to \nother  creatures  ;  even  as  the  same  inference  had  already  been \nfurnished  by  the  angelic  nature.  But  this  trial  could  not  have \nbeen  made,  and  this  exhibition  therefore  could  not  have  been \neffected,  if  he  had  possessed  the  Spirit ;  or,  in  other  words,  if  he \nhad  been  united  to  God.  So  united,  he  could  not  have  been \novercome.

It  was  shewn  therefore,  in  that  first  man, \nby  a  terrible  example,  for  the  bruising  under  of \nour  pride,  what  our  Freewill  can  do  when  left  to \nitself;  yea,  when  urged  and  increased  continually, \nyet  more  and  more,  by  the  Spirit  of  God.  The \nfirst  man  could  not  attain  to  a  more  enlarged \nmeasure  of  the  Spirit,  of  which  he  possessed  the \nfirstfruits,  but  fell  from  the  possession  of  those \nfirstfruits.  How  should  we,  in  our  fallen  state, \nhave  power  to  recover  those  firstfruits,  which \nhave  been  taken  from  us  ?  Especially,  since  Satan \nnow  reigns  in  us  with  full  power;  who  laid  the \nfirst  man  prostrate  by  a  mere  temptation,  when \nhe  had  not  yet  got  to  reign  in  him. — It  were  impos- \nsible to  maintain  a  stronger  debate  against  Free- \nwill, than  by  discussing  this  text  of  Ecclesiasticus, \nin  connection  with  the  fall  of  Adam  :  but  I  have  not \nroom  for  such  a  descant  here,  and  perhaps  the \nmatter  will  present  itself  elsewhere.  Meanwhile, \nlet  it  suffice  to  have  shewn,  that  the  Preacher  says \njust  nothing  in  support  of  Freewill  here  (which  its \nadvocates,  however,  account  their  principal  testi- \nmony) ;    and  that  this  and  similar  passages,  '  If \n\nhim,  would  say),  was  dissolved  }  the  Spirit  which  he  had \npossessed  was  withdrawn  during  his  temptation.

On  this  representation,  the  command \nwas  given  him,  having  the  Spirit ;  and  he  was  tried,  not  having \nthe  Spirit. — So  demonstrable  is  it,  that  Adam  had  not  the  Holy \nGhost  5  whose  in-dwelling  '  doth  not  appertain  to  the  perfection \nof  man's  nature.' — But  the  argument  from  Adam's  state  to  ours \nis  quite  strong  enough,  without  this  unwarranted  assumption  of \nLuther's.  He  that  was  just  come  out  of  the  hands  of  his \nCreator,  made  in  his  image,  and  pronounced  by  him  to  be \nf  very  good,'  could  not  stand  against  a  single  and  solitary  temp- \ntation :  what  should  we  do  therefore  ? \n\nu  As  opposed  to  that  '  stale  and  rejected'  thing  which  good \nis  to  us. \n\n\n160  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  thou  wilt/  cif  thou  wilt  hear/  'if  thou  wilt  do/ \n\n— •  declare  not  what  man  can  do,  but  what  he  ought \n\nto  do.v \nsec.xix.       Another  passage  is  cited  by  our  Diatribe  from \n\nthe  fourth   chapter  of  Genesis,  where  the  Lord \n\nGen.iv.  7-  says  to  Cain,  \"The  desire  of  sin  shall  be  subject \n\nconsi  eie  .  ^  thee,  an(|  thou  shalt  rule  over  it.\"  'It  is  shewn \n\nhere,  says  Diatribe,  that  the  motions  of  the  mind \n\ntowards  evil  may  be  overcome,  and  do  not  induce \n\na  necessity  of  sinning/ \n\nThis  saying,  '  that  the  motions  of  the  mind  to- \nwards evil  may  be  overcome/ is  ambiguous;  but \nthe  general  sentiment,  the  consequence,  and  the \nfacts  compel  us  to  this  understanding  of  it,x  that, \n'it  is  the  property  of  Freewill  to  overcome  its  own \nmotions  towards  evil,  and  that  those  motions  do \nnot  induce  a  necessity  of  sinning/  Why  is  it \nagain  omitted  here,  '  which  is  not  ascribed  to  Free- \nwill' ?y  What  need  is  there  of  the  Spirit,  what  need \nof  Christ,  what  need  of  God,  if  Freewill  can  over- \ncome the  motions  of  the  mind  towards  evil  ?  What \nhas  again  become  of  that  appro vable  opinion, \nwhich  says  that  Freewill  cannot  even  will  good  ? \nHere,  however,  victory  over  evil  is  ascribed  to \n\nv  I  cannot  help  regretting  that  Luther,  after  the  example  of \nhis  opponent,  has  given  so  much  space  to  this  Apocryphal  tes- \ntimony from  Ecclesiasticus.  I  could  have  been  glad,  if  he  had \nnot  only  stood  upon  his  right,  which  he  hints  at  in  the  opening \nof  his  discussion,  declining  to  answer ;  but  had  used  the \noccasion  to  protest  against  the  honour  put  upon  this  book, \nand  the  rest  of  its  brothers  and  sisters,  by  binding  them  up  in \nour  Bibles  and  reading  them  in  our  churches. — The  collateral \nmatter  of  the  argumentation,  however,  is  highly  valuable ; \nand  Luther  could  afford  to  make  his  adversary  a  present  of  an \nargument.  Here,  indeed,  he  may  almost  be  said  to  have  taken  a \nculverin  to  kill  flies  withal.  For,  is  it  not  Adam,  clearly,  of  whom \nthe  Preacher  speaks  ;  whose  will  is  not  the  matter  in  debate  ? \nand  what,  as  we  have  seen,  is  said  even  of  that  will,  which \nmight  not  be  said  of  ours  ?  It  was  left  free  to  choose  ;  and  if \nit  should  choose  good,  good  would  result  from  that  good. \n\nx  Vi  sententue,  consequential  et  rerum  hue  cogiiur. \n\ny  Referring  to  the   f  satis  probabilis  opinio  {  '  sed  non  relin- \nquat,  quod  suis  viribus  ascribat.'

Our  Diatribe's  carelessness  is  beyond  all  ' \nmeasure  here. — Hear  the  truth  of  the  matter  in \nfew  words.  I  have  said  before,  man  has  it  shewn \nto  him,  by  such  expressions  as  these,  not  what  he \ncan  do,  but  what  he  ought  to  do.  Cain  is  told, \ntherefore,  that  he  ought  to  rule  over  sin,  and  to \nkeep  its  lustings  in  subjection  to  himself.  But \nthis  he  neither  did,  nor  could  do,  seeing,  he  was \nnow  pressed  to  the  earth  by  the  foreign\"  yoke  of \nSatan.  It  is  notorious,  that  the  Hebrews  fre- \nquently use  the  future  indicative  for  the  impera- \ntive :  as  in  the  twentieth  chapter  of  Exodus ;  'Thou \nshalt  not  have  any  other  Gods/  '  Thou  shalt  not \nkill/  'Thou  shalt  not  commit  adultery  /  and  num- \nberless such  like  instances.  On  the  contrary,  if \nthe  words  be  taken  indicatively,  according  to \ntheir  literal  meaning/  they  would  be  so  many \npromises  of  God,  who  cannot  lie ;  and  so,  nobody \nwould  commit  sin,  and  there  would  be  no  need \ntherefore  of  these  precepts.  In  fact,  our  trans- \nlator would  have  rendered  the  words  better  in  this \nplace,  if  he  had  said,  •  Let  its  desire  be  subject  to \nthee,  and  do  thou  rule  over  iV  Just  as  it  ought \nalso  to  have  been  said  to  the  woman,  '  Be  subject \nto  thy  husband,  and  let  him  rule  over  thee/ — \nThat  it  was  not  said  indicatively  to  Cain,  appears \nfrom  this  :  it  would  in  that  case  have  been  a  divine \npromise ;  but  it  was  not  a  divine  promise,  for \nthe  very  reverse  happened,  and  the  very  reverse \nwas  done  by  Cain.b \n\n2  Alieno  imperio.~\\  c  A  dominion  out  of  himself ; '  so  that  he \nwas  no  longer  his  own  master. \n\na  Ut  sonant.']  The  sound,  as  opposed  to  the  sense,  or  real \nimport. \n\nb  I  admit  Luther's  principle,  but  demur  to  the  application  of \nit,  both  here  and  in  the  parallel  to  which  he  refers,  Gen.  hi.  16. \nThe  original  passage  is  one  of  great  difficulty.  I  incline  to  the \ninterpretation  which  our  authorized  version  gives  to  it ;  and \nrefer  the  words  which  are  immediately  under  remark,  as  that \nappears  to  do,  not  to  sin,  but  to  Abel.    \"  If  thou  doest  well,  shalt \n\nM \n\n\n162  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.

Was  Cain  ignorant,  with  what  sort  of \noffering  God  was  to  be  approached  ? — Whatever  might  be  said \nof  later  times,  Cain  must  have  heard  all  about  Eden,  the  ser- \npent and  the  woman,  the  serpent's  seed  and  the  woman's \nseed  5  and  must  have  seen  the  coats  of  skins.  Cain  despised \nfC  the  way  5\"  he  would  none  of  Christ. — Then,  God's  words \nare  adapted  to  quiet,  and  to  instruct  him.  We  know  that  a \nman  can  no  more  come  by  Christ,  except  it  be  given  him  from \nabove,  than  he  can  come  by  the  law.  But  this  was  not  the \nthing  to  be  shewn  him ;  he  was  to  be  reminded  of  the  alone \nway  of  access,  that  he  might  make  the  fullest  developement  of \nhimself,  if  he  should  continue  to  neglect  and  despise  it  :  and, \nsince  jealous  and  angry  fears  were  now  arising  in  his  mind  with \nrespect  to  his  brother ;  chiefly,  lest  he  should  lose  the  earthly \nsuperiority  attached  to  his  primogeniture ;  he  is  pacified  with \nan  assurance  (connected,  doubtless,  with  the  fore-mentioned \ncondition),  that  this  dominion  should  remain  in  his  hands  -,  an \nassurance  conveyed  in  words  very  nearly  resembling  those \nby  which  Eve  was  warned  of  her  subjection  to  Adam.  The \nSeptuagint  gives  another  turn  to  the  former  part  of  the  verse, \nbut  clearly  refers  the  latter  as  I  do ;  and  so  in  Gen.  iii.  16. — \nAccording  to  this  view,  the  words  of  this  text  have  nothing  to \ndo  with  Freewill,  though  it  seems  the  Hebrew  Rabbins,  as \nwell  as  Luther  and  Erasmus,  thought  they  had.  (See  Pole's \nSynops.  in  loc.) — If  they  must  be  referred  to  sin,  not  Abel ; \nLuther's  interpretation  is  correct,  and  his  answer  unanswer- \nable.— If  the  words  be  taken  indicatively ,  they  are  a  promise \nof  God,  which  was  broken  as  soon  as  made. \n\nc  lnculces.~\\  A  figurative  expression  from  e  treading  in  with \nthe  feet  j '  hence  applied  to  those  efforts  by  which,  like  the \npavier  ramming  down  his  stones,  we  aim  to  drive  or  beat  our \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  163 \n\nallowed  to  say  the  same  thing  many  times  over.  If  sec.  xx. \n\nthere  be  freeness  of  choice d  in  the  soul,  why  has  \n\nyour  approvable  opinion  said  that  the  free  will \ncannot  will  good  ?  Can  it  choose  without  will- \ning, or  against  its  will? — But  let  us  hear  your \nsimile. \n\nIt  would  be  ridiculous  to  say  to  a  man  standing \nin  a  street  where  two  ways  meet,  c  you  see  two \nways,  enter  which  you  please ; '  when  only  one  is \nopen. \n\nThis  is  just  what  I  said  before,  about  the  argu- \nments of  carnal  reason :  she  thinks  that  man  is \nmocked  by  an  impossible  precept ;  whereas  we \nsay,  he  is  admonished  and  excited  by  it  to  see \nhis  own  impotency.  Truly  then,  we  are  in  this \nsort  of  street ;  but  only  one  way  is  open  to  us  :  or \nrather,  no  way  is  open.6  But  it  is  shewn  us  by \nthe  law,  how  impossible  it  is  for  us  to  choose  the \none — that  leading  to  good,  I  mean — except  God \ngive  his  Holy  Spirit:  how  broad  and  easy  the \nother  is,  if  God  allow  us  to  walk  in  it.  Without \nmockery  then,  and  with  all  necessary  gravity,  it \nwould  be  said  to  a  man  standing  in  the  street, \nc  enter  which  of  the  two  you  please ; '  if,  either \nhe  should  have  a  mind  to  appear  strong  in  his \nown  eyes,  being  infirm  ;  or  should  maintain  that \nneither  of  these  ways  is  shut  against  him. \n\nThe  words  of  the  law  then,  are  spoken  not  to \naffirm  the  power  of  the  will,  but  to  enlighten  blind \nreason ;  that  she  may  see  what  a  nothing  her  light \n\nmeaning  into  a  person's  head.

The  principle1\"  and  power \nof  the  law  has  for  -its  essence  the  affording  of \nknowledge,  and  that  only  of  sin;  not  the  display- \ning of  any  power,  or  the  conferring  of  any. \n\nFor  thisg  knowledge,  neither  is  power,  nor \nconfers  power,  but  instructs  ;  and  shews  that  there \nis  no  power  in  that  quarter,  and  how  great  is  the \ninfirmity  in  that  quarter.  For  what  else  can  the \nknowledge  of  sin  be,  but  the  knowledge  of  our \ninfirmity  and  of  our  wickedness.  Nor  does  he \nsay,  c  by  the  law  comes  the  knowledge  of  virtue, \nor  good : 9  but  all  that  the  law  does,  according  to \nPaul,  is  to  cause  sin  to  be  known. \n\nThis  is  that  passage  from  which  I  drew  my \nanswer,  c  that  by  the  words  of  the  law  man  is  ad- \nmonished and  instructed  what  he  ought  to  do, \nnot  what  he  can  do  ;'  that  is,  to  know  his  sin,  not \nto  believe  that  he  has  some  power.  So  that,  as \noften  as  you  cast  the  words  of  the  law  in  my  teeth, \nI  will  answer  you,  my  Erasmus,  with  this  saying \nof  Paul;  \"By  the  law  is  the  knowledge  of  sin/' \nnot  power  in  the  will.  Take  now  some  of  your \nlarger  Concordances,  and  heap  together  all  the \nimperative  verbs  into  one  chaos  (so  they  be  not \nwords  of  promise,  but  words  of  exaction  and  law), \nand  I  shall  presently  shew  you,  that  by  these  is \nalways  intimated  not  what  men  do,  or  can  do,  but \nwhat  they  ought  to  do.  Your  grammar-masters, \nand  boys  in  the  streets,  know  this ;  that  by  verbs \n\nf  Tota  ratio  et  virtus  legis.~]  Rat.  a  word  of  very  extensive  and \nvarious  signification,  expresses  '  the  nature,  order,  object, \nstructure,  and  relations  of  any  substance.'  e  Principle'  seems \nbest  to  express  it  here  :  as  comprehending*  both  design  and \nconstitution.

For  let  me  try  now, \nwhether  it  be  possible  to  rouse  Diatribe  from  her \nlethargy.  Supposel  should  argue  thus :  when  Moses \nsays,  i choose  life,  and  keep  the  commandment;'  ex- \ncept a  man  can  choose  life  and  keep  the  command- \nment, it  is  ridiculous  in  Moses  to  enjoin  this  upon \nman:  should  I  by  this  argument  have  proved,  that \nFreewill  can  do  nothing  good ;  or  that  it  has  endea- \nvour, but  not  of  its  own  power  ?  °     No,  I  should \nhave  proved,  by  a  pretty  bold  sort  of  comparison/ \nthat,  either  man  can  choose  life  and  keep  the  com- \nmandment, as  he  is  ordered  to  do ;  or  Moses  is  a \nridiculous  teacher.     JBut  who  would  dare  to  call \nMoses  a  ridiculous  teacher?  It  follows  therefore, \nthat   man  can    do    the    things    commanded   him. \nThis  is  the  way,  in  which  Diatribe  is  continually \narguing  against  her   own  thesis  ;    by  which,   she \nengaged  not  to  maintain  any  such  position  as  this, \nbut  to  show  a  certain  power  of  endeavouring  in \nFreewill :    of  which,    however,   she   makes   little \nmention  in  the  whole  series  of  her  arguments,  so \nfar  is  she  from  proving  it.  Nay,  she  rather  proves \nthe  contrary  :  so  as  to  be  herself  rather,  the  ridi- \nculous speaker  and  arguer  every  where. q \n\n°  Sine  suis  viribus.~\\  He  plays  upon  '  the  approvable  opinion  ;' \nwhich  leaves  endeavour,  but  does  not  leave  it  to  be  ascribed  to \nFreewill' s  own  power. \n\np  Satis  fort i  contmtione.~\\  Cont.  is  sometimes  used  in  a  rheto- \nrical sense  to  express  one  of  the  parts  of  an  oration ;  '  dispu- \ntatio  sive  disceptatio,'  opposed  to  '  quaestio  '  or  c  controversia ;' \nwhat  might  properly  be  called  c  the  argumentation:'  but  is \nhere  used  in  another  rhetorical  sense,  to  express  '  contrast, \ncomparison,  or  antithesis j '  (  Moses's  folly,'  set  in  array  against \n(  man's  power.' \n\n^  She  imputed  this  to  Luther  :  she  would  make  either  him \nor  Moses  absurd  ;  the  real  absurdity  lay  in  adducing  argu- \nments, which  either  proved  nothing,  or  proved  the  opposite. \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  169 \n\nWith  respect  to  its  being  ridiculous,  according  sc.  xxn. \nto  the  simile  you  have  introduced,  that  a  man  tied  ~7~  7\" \nby  the  right  arm  should  be  bidden  to  stretch  out  f^and \nhis  hand  to  the  right,  when  he  can  only  stretch  it  tied. \nout  to  the  left;  would  it  be  ridiculous,  I  ask — if \na  man,  who  was  tied  even  by  both  hands,  should \nproudly  maintain,  or  ignorantly  presume,  that  he \ncould  do  what  he  pleased  on  both  sides  of  him — \nto  bid  such  a  man  stretch  out  his  hand  to  which- \nsoever side  he  likes  ;  not  with  the  design  of  laugh- \ning at  his  captive  state,  but  that  the  false  pre- \nsumption of  his  own  liberty  and  power  may  be \nevinced,  or  that  his  ignorance  of  his  captivity  and \nmisery  may  be  made  notorious  to  himself.

But  such  a  man \nis  no  where  to  be  found :  and  if  there  were  such \na  man,  then  it  would  indeed  be  true,  that,  either \nimpossibilities  are  enjoined  ridiculously,  or  the \nSpirit  of  Christ  is  given  in  vain.r \n\nBut  the  Scripture  sets  before  us  a  man,  who  is  Uses  of \nnot  only  bound,  wretched,  captive,   sick,   dead,  t!je  la^ \nbut  who  adds  this  plague  of  blindness  (through  pfacica- \nthe   agency   of  Satan   his    prince)    to  his    other  ble- \nplagues,  and  so  thinks  himself  at  liberty,  happy, \nunshackled,    able,    in  health,   alive.

What  is  the  conclu- \nsion, then,  from  arguments  of  this  kind,  but  that \nFreewill  needs  not  the  grace  of  God,  for  she  can \ndo  every  thing  by  her  own  power  ?  How  much \nmore  properly  are  the  words  taken,  just  as  they \nstand ! b  c  If  thou  shalt  have  been  turned,  I  also \nwill  turn  thee/  that  is,  if  thou  shalt  leave  off \nsinning,  I  also  will  leave  off  punishing ;  and  if, \nwhen  thou  art  converted,  thou  shalt  lead  a  good \nlife,  I  also  will  do  thee  good,  and  will  turn  thy \ncaptivity  and  thy  evils.0     But  it  does  not  follow \n\nunto  all  that  call  upon  Him\" — his  warrant  for  drawing  near, \nand  his  first  words  of  consolation  ? — But  these,  at  last,  are  not \n4  offers '  of  grace ;  by  which  God  throws  himself,  as  it  were, \nat  the  knees  and  feet  of  his  creatures — subjecting  himself  to  a \nrefusal-  nay,  with  full  assurance  that  he  must  receive  one, \nexcept  he  superadd  a  special  and  distinct  impulse  of  his  own \nto  secure  acceptance — but  testimonies  of  his  own  mouth,  and \nhand,  and  ordinances,  borne  to  those  souls  which  he,  in  his \nown  good  time,  has  made  ready  to  welcome  them ;  that  he \nwill  bind  up,  and  heal,  and  own,  these  poor  destitutes,  amidst \nthe  gathered  remnant  of  his  heritage. \n\nb  Verba,  ut  posita  sunt.\"]  '  Without  additions,'  such  as  Eras- \nmus's. \n\nc  I  do  not  know  that  any  reasonable  objection  can  be  made \nto  Luther's  paraphrase  of  Jeremiah  xv.  19,  and  Malachi  (he \ncalls  him  Zechariah)  iii.  7.

Now,  when \nhe  shall  have  known  and  seen  this,  he  would  seek \nthe  power,  which  he  hath  not,  from  the  source \nwhence  he  might  have  it,d  if  Diatribe's  Leviathan \n(her  appendage  and  consequence,  I  mean)  did  not \ncome  in  the  way,  saying,  ' It  would  in  vain  be \nsaid,  6i  Turn  ye/'  except  a  man  could  turn  by  his \nown  power.' — What  sort  of  a  saying  this  is,  and \nwhat  it  proves,  has  been  declared  abundantly. \n\nIt  is  the  effect  of  stupor  or  lethargy  to  suppose \nthat  Freewill  is  established  by  those  words,  'Turn \nye,'  c  If  thou  shalt  turn,'  and  the  like ;  and  not  to \nperceive,  that,  upon  the  same  principle,  it  would \nalso  be  established  by  this  saying,  u  Thou  shalt \nlove  the  Lord  thy  God  with  all  thy  heart;\"  since \nthe  demand  in  the  one  case,  is  equivalent  to  the \ncommand*  in  the  other.  Nor  is  the  love  of  God, \nand  of  all  his  commandments,  less  required  than  our \nown  conversion  ;  since  the  love  of  God  is  our  true \nconversion.  And  yet  no  man  argues  Freewill \nfrom  that  commandment  of  love,  whilst  all  argue \n\nseems  perfectly  out  of  place  :  it  is  a  personal  matter  between \nthe  Lord  and  his  Prophet,  a  converted  man  :  what  has  this  to \ndo,  then,  with  the  question  of  Freewill  ? \n\nd  Qucerat  uncle  possit.']  I  have  been  inclined  to  connect \nthese  words  with  the  preceding  sentence  ;  c  by  which  he  is \nadmonished  what  he  ought  to  be  ;  and  having  understood  and \ndiscovered  this,  is  admonished  to  seek  the  power  which  he \nhath  not  whence  he  might  get  it  ;  if  Diatribe  should  not  inter- \nvene,' &c.< — The  punctuation,  however,  forbids  this  connection, \nand  it  does  not  appear  to  be  Luther's  meaning.  He  imputes  it \nto  Diatribe's  false  suggestion,  if  man,  warned  that  he  ought  to \nturn  to  God,  does  not  find  out  his  own  impotency,  and  seek  his \nconversion  from  God.  But  there  is  much  more  that  goes  to \nthis  seeking,  than  Luther  seems  to  include  in  it:  under  the  clear- \nest light,  men  will  still  resist  conviction  ;  and  the  heart  to  seek, \nis  as  much  a  gift,  as  conversion  itself. \n\ne  More  literally,  '  since  the  meaning  of  the  commander  and \nthe  demander  is  equal  on  both  sides.' \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  175 \n\nit  from  those  words,    c  If  tliou  shalt  be  willing/  sc.xxiv. \n\n<  If  thou  shalt  hear/   '  Turn/  and  the  like.

Thus,  it  remains  as  a  just  con- \nclusion, even  from  the  testimony  of  the  scholastic \ndoctors,  that  the  words  of  the  law  do  not  prove \na  power  in  the  free  will,  bnt  show  what  we  ought \nto  do,  and  what  we  cannot  do. \n\nBut  our  Diatribe,  with  still  greater  absurdity,  Mai. \n\nmore \nticul \nconsidered. \n\n\nni.  /. \n\n\nnot  only  infers  an  indicative  sense  from  that  say-  morf  Par \n\nJ  J       ticularly \n\n\nf  Dilige  Deum.

At  last, \nthen,  she  attributes  endeavour  even  to  God;  in- \ntending perhaps  to  prepare  grace  for  His  endea- \nvourings  also.  For,  if  '  to  turn 9  signifies  6  to \nendeavour 9  in  one  place ;  why  not  in  all  ? \n\nAgain,  in  that  passage  of  Jeremiah,  'If  thou \nshalt  separate  the  precious  from  the  vile/  she \nmaintains  that  not  only  'endeavour,'  but  even \n6  freedom  of  choice/  is  proved :  what  she  had \nbefore  taught  us  to  have  been  lost,  and  to  have \nbeen  turned  into  a  necessity  of  serving  sin.  You \nsee  then,  that  Diatribe  truly  possesses  a  free  will \nin  her  handlings  of  Scripture  ;  by  which  she  com- \npels words,  of  one  and  the  same  form,  to  prove \nendeavour  in  one  place,  and  free  choice  in  ano- \nther; just  as  she  pleases. \n\nBut  bidding  adieu  to  these  vanities,  the  word \n'  turn 9  has  two  uses  in  Scripture ;  a  legal,  and  an \nevangelical  one.  In  its  legal  use,  it  is  an  exacter \nand  commander ;  requiring  not  endeavour  only, \nbut  change  of  the  whole  life;  as  Jeremiah  fre- \nquently uses  it,  saying,  '  Turn  ye  every  one  from \nhis  evil  way  /  '  Turn  to  the  Lord  :9  where  it  evi- \ndently involves  an  exacting  of  all  the  command- \nments. When  used  evangelically,  it  is  a  word  of \ndivine  promise  and  consolation;  by  which  nothing \nis  demanded  from  us,  but  the  grace  of  God  is \noffered  to  us.  Such  is  that  of  Psalm  cxxvi. \nc  When  the  Lord  shall  turn  again  the  captivity \no£  Zion  /  and  that  of  Psalm  cxvi.  '  Turn  again \nthen  unto  thy  rest,  0  my  soul !'   And  so  Zecharias \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  177 \n\ncontrives  to  dispatch  both  sorts  of  preaching  (law  as  sc.xxiv. \n\nwell  as  grace)  in  a  very  short  compendium.  It  is  all  \n\nlaw,  and  the  sum  of  the  law,  when  he  says,  '  Return \nunto  me :'  it  is  grace,  when  he  says,  '  I  will \nreturn  unto  you/  As  far,  therefore,  as  Freewill  is \nproved  by  that  saying,  e  Love  the  Lord/  or  by \nany  other  saying  of  any  particular  law;  just  so  far, \nand  no  farther,  is  it  proved  by  this  summary  law \nword  6  Turn/  It  is  the  part  of  a  wise  reader \nof  Scripture  then,  to  observe  what  are  law \nwords,  and  what  are  grace  words;  that  he  may \nnot  jumble  them  all  together,  like  the  filthy \nSophists,  and  like  this  yawning  Diatribe.1 \n\n1  Luther's  distinction  between  law  words  and  gospel  words, \nas  applied  by  him  in  these  two  sections,  severally  and  com- \nparedly,  is  arbitrary,  indefinite,  and  unavailing1.  Arbitrary ;  in- \nasmuch as  lie  pretends  not  to  have  any  recognised  authority  for \nit,  and  applies  it  inconsistently  j  sometimes  calling  words  of \nexhortation  or  command  c  gospel  words  5'  and  sometimes  con- \nfining that  term  to  words  of  promise,  as  opposed  to  them. \n'  Turn  ye  unto  me '  is  a  law  word  ;  '  I  will  turn  to  you  '  is  a \ngospel  word.  Indefinite ;  because  he  gives  no  fixed  rule  by \nwhich  to  determine  what  is  one,  and  what  is  the  other ;  but, \naccording  to  his  own  account,  leaves  it  to  the  discerning \nreader.  Unavailing ;  because  a  gospel  precept  is  not  less  im- \npracticable than  a  law  one  to  the  free  will. — In  my  view,  he \nconfounds  matters  ;  for  f  return,'  or  '  repent,'  is  surely  not  a \nlaw  precept,  but  a  gospel  one  :  the  law  knows  nothing  of \nrepentance. — The  truth  is,  he  has  given  his  answer  to  all  these \ntestimonies  already.  They  are  requirements  j  call  them  law \nrequirements,  if  you  will,  or  gospel  requirements  5  they  are \nsomething  for  man  to  do  ;  and,  as  he  very  properly  argues, \nthey  are  meant  to  shew  him  what  he  ought  to  do,  but  imply \nnot  any  power  either  towards  Law,  or  towards  Gospel.  The  law \nis,  properly,  (  the  law  of  the  Ten  Commandments  ;*  under \nwhich,  speaking  less  precisely,  may  be  comprehended  all  those \nprecepts  which  fall  in  with  the  nature  and  design  of  that \n'  transcript  of  the  creation  law  of  man  j\"  but  nothing  which \nregards  his  relations  as  a  fallen,  or  as  a  restored  creature. — \nLuther  speaks  confusedly,  as  other  writers  do,  on  this  subject; \nnot  discerning  the  origin,  design,  and  nature  of  that  institu- \ntion.— The  law  spake  not  till  Moses  ;  spake  only  to  the  Jews, \nor  then  visible  church  of  God ;  was  a  preparation  for,  and \na  fore-preached  Gospel.  A  law  word  therefore,  rightly  under- \nstood, is  also  a  gospel  word  :  a  word  which  prepareth,  by  com- \npelling a  sense  of  need  5  and  which— whilst  it  'f  shuts  up  unto \n\nN \n\n\n178  !

Where  then  are  those  who  deny  that  man \n\ndoes  any  thing  ?? \n\nWhat  an  excellent  consequence  is  here  !  She \nwas  going  to  prove  desire  and  endeavour  in  Free- \nwill ;  but  she  proves  the  whole  act,  every  thing \ndone  to  the  uttermost  by  Freewill.  Where  now \nare  they  who  maintain  the  necessity  of  grace  and \nof  the  Holy  Spirit?  For  this  is  her  ingenious \nway  of  arguing :  *  Ezekiel  says,  If  the  wicked \nman  shall  turn  away  from  his  wickedness  and  do \njustice  and  judgment,  he  shall  live. — Why  then  the \nwicked  man  presently  does  so,  and  can  do  so/ \nEzekiel  intimates  what  ought  to  be  done;  Diatribe \nconsiders  this  as  what  is  done,  and  has  been  done ; \nagain  introducing  a  new  sort  of  grammar,  by \nwhich  she  may  teach  us  that  it  is  the  same  thing \nto  owe,  as  to  have — the  same  thing  to  be  enacted, \nas  to  be  performed — the  same  thing  to  demand, \nas  to  pay. \n\nAfter  this,  she  lays  hold  on  that  sweetest  of  gos- \npel words,  f  I  would  not  the  death  of  a  sinner/ \nand  gives  this  turn  to  it;k  '  Does  the  holy  Lord \ndeplore  that  death  of  his  people,  which  he  works \nin  them  himself  ?  If  he  would  not  the  death  of  a \nsinner,  verily,  it  is  to  be  imputed  to  our  own  will \nif  we  perish.  But  what  can  you  impute  to  a  being, \n\nthe  faith  which  should  afterwards  be  revealed,\"  and  which  now \nhas  been  revealed — impliedly  promises  and  exhibits  Him  who \nwas  to  be,  and  who  now  has  been  and  is,  its  fulfiller  and \nperfecter. \n\nk  Sic  versat.']  Vers,  implies  a  forced  application  of  it ;  as  if  you \nshould  turn  a  body,  that  is  already  in  motion,  out  of  its  natural \ncourse ;  or  give  motion  to  one  that  is  at  rest. \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  179 \n\nwho  has  no  power  to  do  any  thing,  either  good  or  sc.xxvi. \nevil?*  i \n\nPelagius  also  sang  just  the  same  sort  of  song; \nwhen  he  ascribed  not  desire  and  endeavour  only, \nbut  complete  power  of  fulfilling  and  doing  every \nthing  to  Freewill.  For  these  consequences  prove \nthis  power,  as  I  have  before  said,  if  they  prove  any \nthing;  and  therefore  fight  as  stoutly,  and  even \nmore  so,  against  Diatribe  herself  (who  denies \nthis  power  in  Freewill,  and  sets  up  endeavour \nonly),  as  against  us  who  deny  Freewill  altogether. \nBut  without  dwelling  upon  her  ignorance,  I  will \nstate  the  matter  as  it  really  is. \n\nIt  is  a  gospel  word,  and  a  word  of  sweetest  The  true \nconsolation  to  poor  miserable  sinners,  when  Eze-  meaning \nkiel  says,  cc  I  would  not  the  death  of  a  sinner,  xvih\\  23. \nbut  rather  that  he  should  be  converted  and  live,  stated. \nby  all  means .\"  As  is  that  of  the  thirtieth  Psalm \nalso,  \"  For  his  wrath  is  but  for  a  moment,  and \nhis  will  towards  us  life  rather  than  death.\"  And \nthat  of  the  thirty-sixth  Psalm,  \"  How  sweet  is  thy \nmercy,  Lord  !\"  Also,  \"  Because  I  am  merciful.\" \nAnd  that  saying  of  Christ,  in  Matthew  xi.  \"  Come \nunto  me,  all  ye  that  labour,  and  I  will  refresh \nyou.\"  Also  that  of  Exodus,  \"  I  do  mercy  to \nthem  that  love  me,  unto  many  thousands.\"  Nay, \nwhat  is  almost  more  than  half  of  the  Scripture \nbut  mere  promises  of  grace,  by  which  mercy,  life, \npeace,  and  salvation  are  offered  to  men  ? l  And \nwhat  other  import  have  words  of  promise  than \nthis,  \"  I  would  not  the  death  of  a  sinner  ?\"  Is  it \nnot  the  same  thing  to  say,  \\  I  am  merciful/  as  to \nsay,  '  I  am  not  angry/  '  I  do  not  wish  to  punish/ \n'  I  do  not  wish  you  to  die/  '  I  wish  to  pardon \nyou/  '  I  wish  to  spare  you  V  Now,  if  these \ndivine  promises  did  not  stand  in  the  word,  to \nraise  up  those  whose  consciences  have  been \nwounded  with  the  sense  of  sin,  and  terrified  with \n\n1  See  above,  Sect  xxiii.  note  a. \n\nn2 \n\n\n180  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  the  fear  of  death  and  judgment,  what  place  would \n\nthere  be  for  pardon,  or  for  hope  ?     What  sinner \n\nwould  not  despair?  But,  as  Freewill  is  not \nproved  by  other  words  of  pity,  or  promise,  or \nconsolation,  so  neither  is  it  proved  by  this,  \"I \nwould  not  the  death  of  a  sinner.\" \n\nBut  our  Diatribe,  again  confounding  the  dis- \ntinction between  law  words  and  words  of  promise, \nmakes  this  place  of  Ezekiel  a  law  word,  and  ex- \npounds it  thus:  6  I  would  not  the  death  of  a \nsinner;' that  is,  c  I  would  not  that  he  should  sin \nmortally,  or  become  a  sinner  guilty  of  death ; \nbut  rather  that  he  should  turn  away  from  his  sin, \nif  he  hath  committed  any,  and  so  should  live/  For, \nif  she  did  not  expound  it  so,  it  would  not  serve \nher  purpose  at  all :  but  such  an  exposition  en- \ntirely subverts  and  withdraws  this  most  persua- \nsive word  of  Ezekiel,  *  I  would  not  the  death  of \na  sinner/  If  we  are  determined  so  to  read  and \nunderstand  the  Scriptures,  by  the  exercise  of  our \nown  blindness,  what  wonder  if  they  be  obscure \nand  ambiguous  ?  For  he  does  not  say,  '  I  would \nnot  the  sin  of  a  man/  but  *  I  would  not  the  death \nof  a  sinner ;'  clearly  intimating,  that  he  speaks  of \nthe  punishment  of  sin,  which  the  sinner  is  expe- \nriencing for  his  sin ;  that  is,  the  fear  of  death.  Yes; \nHe  raises  up  and  consoles  the  sinner,  when  now \nlaid  on  this  bed  of  affliction  and  despair,  that  he \nmay  not  quench  the  smoking  flax,  or  break  the \nbruised  reed,  but  may  excite  hope  of  pardon  and \nsalvation  :  that  so  he  may  rather  be  converted \n(converted,  I  mean,  to  salvation  from  the  punish- \nment of  death)  and  live ;  that  is,  be  happy,  and \nrejoice  in  a  quiet  conscience.™ \n\nFor   this  also   must  be  observed,  that,  as  the \n\nm  His  state  as  a  sinner  is  a  state  of  eternal  death,  the  just \npunishment  of  his  sin  -,  and  of  this  state  he  has  the  beginning \nin  his  now  realizing  apprehensions  of  it.  When  converted, \nhe  is  delivered  from  this  state  of  punishment ;  and  when  he \nlives ,  he  is  brought  into  the  joy  of  this  changed  state. \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  181 \n\nvoice  of  the  law  is  sounded  forth  only  over  those  sc.xxvii \n\nwho  neither  feel  nor  acknowledge  their   sin  (as  \n\nPaul  speaks  in  Rom.  iii.  \"  By  the  law  is  the \nknowledge  of  sin\");  so  the  word  of  grace  comes \nbut  to  those  who,  feeling  their  sin,  are  afflicted \nand  tempted  to  despair.  Thus  it  is,  that,  in  all  law \nwords,  you  see  sin  charged  by  shewing  us  what \nwe  ought  to  do :  just  as,  in  all  words  of  promise, \non  the  other  hand,  you  see  the  misery,  which \nsinners  (that  is,  those  who  are  to  be  raised  up  from \ntheir  dejection  by  them)  labour  under,  intimated  : \nas  here,  the  word  ?  I  would  not  the  death  of  a \nsinner 9  expressly  names  death  and  the  sinner ; \nthe  very  evil  which  is  felt,  as  well  as  the  very \nman  who  feels  it.  But  in  this  word  c  Love  God \nwith  all  thy  heart 9  there  is  pointed  out  the  good  we \nowe,  not  the  evil  we  feel;  that  we  may  be  brought \nto  acknowledge  how  incapable  we  are  of  doing \nthat  good. \n\nSo  then,  nothing  could  have  been  more  unaptly  Ezek.xviii. \nadduced  in  support  of  Freewill,  than  this  passage  J^™^ \nfrom  Ezekiel ;  which  even  fights  against  it  most  wm,  in- \nlustily.     For  herein  is  implied,  how  Freewill  is  stead  of \naffected,  and  what  it  is  able  to  do,  when  sin  has  pioving  lt \nbeen  discovered,  and  when  now  the  matter  is  to \nturn  itself  to  God :  it  is  herein  implied,  I  say, \nthat  it  could  do  nothing  but  fall  into  a  still  worse \nstate,  adding  desperation  and  impenitence  to  its \nother  sins,  unless  God  should  presently  come  to \nits  succour,  and  should  recall  and  raise  it  up,n  by \nhis  word  of  promise.     For   God's  eagerness  in \npromising   grace    to    restore    and   raise   up   the \nsinner,  is  a  very  mighty  and  trustworthy  argu- \nment, that  Freewill  of  herself  cannot  but  fall  from \nbad  to  worse;  and,  as  the  Scripture  says,  \"to \n\nn  Revocaret  et  erigeret.~\\  Revoc.  implies  e  departure  $'  the \nsoul  has  gone  further  and  further  off  from  God,  through  de- \nspair of  mercy  :  erig.  implies  e  fallen ,'  '  thrown  down,'  ( pros- \ntrated ;'  like  Saul  before  the  witch  of  Endor. \n\n\n182  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\nPART  in.  the  nethermost  hell/'0     Do  you  think  that  God  is \n\nso  light-minded  as  to  pour  out  words  of  promise \n\nthus  fluently,  when  they  are  not  necessary  to  our \nsalvation,  for  the  mere  pleasure  of  talking?  You \nsee  then  from  this  fact,  that  not  only  do  all  law \nwords  stand  opposed  to  Freewill,  but  even  all \nwords  of  promise  do  utterly  confute  it.  In  other \nwords,  the  whole  Scripture  is  at  war  with  it.  So \nthat  this  saying  '  I  would  not  the  death  of  a \nsinner*  has  no  other  object,  as  you  perceive,  than \nthat  of  preaching  and  offering  divine  mercy \nthrough  the  world  ;p  which  none  but  those  who \nhave  been  afflicted  and  harassed  to  death  receive \nwith  joy  and  gratitude.  These  do  so,  because  the \nlaw  has  in  them  already  fulfilled  its  office,  by \nteaching  the  knowledge  of  sin :  whilst  those  who \nhave  not  yet  experienced  this  office  of  the  law, \nand  who  neither  acknowledge  their  sin,  nor  feel \ntheir  death,  despise  the  mercy  promised  in  that \nword.q \n\n°  The  Psalms  abound  with  expressions  of  this  sort :  see  es- \npecially the  38th  and  88th ;  from  the  latter  of  which  these \nwords  appear  to  be  a  quotation.  t(  For  my  life  draweth  nigh \nunto  the  grave  (v.  3) ;  or,  according  to  the  older  version,  \"  to \nhell.\"  (v.  2.) \n\n5  See  above,  note  a.  The  account  I  have  there  given  of \nLuther's  meaning  is  abundantly  confirmed  here.  Mercy  is  to \nbe  preached,  and  what  he  calls  '  offered,'  generally  to  all  men  5 \nbut  only  those  in  whom  the  law  has  done  its  office  (and  whom \ndid  Luther  understand  by  these,  but  God's  elect  ?)  will  receive \nit.  His  offer,  therefore,  is  a  nugatory  offer  to  all  but  the \nelect  3  and  these  must  receive  5  not  '  physically '  must,  but \n■  morally.' \n\n1  Luther's  answer  to  Erasmus's  argument  from  Ezek.  xviii. \n23.  is  threefold.  1.  It  proves  too  much.  2.  It  proves  no  more \nthan  other  gospel  words  5  that  is,  words  of  promise  and  mercy. \n3.  Such  words  prove  against  Freewill,  by  implying,  that  without \nthem  man  could  only  despair. \n\nSee  above,  note  ',  where  I  have  objected  to  this  distinction \nbetween  law  words  and  gospel  words,  and  to  the  statements \ngenerally  made  respecting  the  Law,  as  though  it  were  opposed \nto  the  Gospel.  Luther  is  chargeable  here  with  arguing  '  per \nsequelam,'   for  which  he  so  much  blames  Erasmus  5   *  God's \n\n\nmay \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  183 \n\nBut,  as  to  why  some  are  touched  by  the  law  s.xxviii. \nand  others  not/  so  that  the  former  take  in,  and  the \nlatter  despise,  the  grace  offered;  this  is  another  G°J  ' \n\nword  of  promise  proves  that  man  could  only  despair  without \nit.' — The  true  answer  to  Erasmus's  argument  from  this  text \n(which,  according  to  Luther's  distinction,  is  a  gospel  word — but \nthen  there  is  quite  as  much  supernatural  help  necessary  to \nmake  a  gospel  word  availing,  as  to  fulfil  a  law  one — )  is,  that  it \nproves  nothing  on  either  side.  Inferences  may  be  drawn  both \nways  ;  against  as  well  as  for,  and  for  as  well  as  against :  but \nthe  affirmation  respects  only  the  mind  of  God.  He  declares \nthat  he  wills  not  death.  What  does  this  assert  concerning  the \nnatural  powers  of  man  ? — For  a  more  full  view  of  the  doctrine \nset  forth  in  this  and  like  texts,  and  of  their  place  in  the  great \nscheme  of  God-manifestation,  see  the  next  Section  and  its  notes. \nr  Luther  has  given  what  he  considers  the  true  answer  to \nErasmus's  objection  drawn  from  this  text  5  t  it  is  a  gospel \nword,  for  the  consolation  of  the  law-stricken  y  and  declares \nthat  we  have  no  right  to  ask  any  more  questions.  I  do  not \napprove  the  exact  point  to  which  he  brings  the  debate,  nor  can \nI  agree  with  him  that  it  ought  to  end  just  here.  Luther \nspeaks,  and  many  others  like  him,  as  if  only  the  law  (meaning \nthereby  the  law  of  the  Ten  Commandments)  could  do  the \noffice  of  abasing  and  prostrating  man  5  which,  in  effect, \nassumes  that  the  law  was  given  to  man  from  the  beginning, \nand  that  Moses's  giving  of  it  was  but  a  republication  :  else  how \nwere  those  saints  emptied  of  self  and  prostrated,  who  lived \nbefore  Moses  ;  such  as  Abel,  Enoch,  Noah,  and  the  rest  ?  But \nwhat  proof  is  there  of  the  law  having  been  given  from  the \nbeginning  ?  Express  proof  is  afforded  in  Rom.  v.  that  the  law \nwas  not  till  Moses.  \"  For  until  the  law  sin  was  in  the  world  : \nbut  sin  is  not  imputed  when  there  is  no  law.  Nevertheless \ndeath  reigned  from  Adam  to  Moses,  &c.\"  (vv.  13,  14.)  The \ntruth  is,  it  is  not  the  law,  but  the  Holy  Ghost  (using  the  law, \nit  is  true,  as  his  instrument  more  generally,  where  it  has  been \ngiven,  but  by  no  means  universally  so  using  it) — who  needeth \nnot  the  law,  but  has  proofs  enough  to  supply  of  man's  sin  ;  of  his \n**  earthly,  sensual,  devilish  \"  mind  3  without  having  recourse \nto  that  summary  of  creation  duty — that  humbles,  empties,  and \nmakes  ready  for  the  manifold  Scripture  declarations  of  God's \nentire  readiness  to  receive  the  penitent  freely.  These  are \nindeed  made  such  of  God,  and  can  only  be  made  such  by  him  5 \nthough  it  is  not  his  plan  usually  to  tell  us  how  we  have  come, \nand  alone  can  come,  to  this  mind,  when  he  testifies  his  love  and \ngood-will  towards  it.  So  that  the  question  arising  from  this \nadmitted  state  of  things,  '  some  receive,  others  do  not  receive, \nthis  and  like  gospel  words,'  is  not  properly  why  some  are  law- \nstricken  ;  or,  more  correctly,  why  some  are  prostrated,  and \nself-emptied,   and  self-despairing  5   but  why  some   have  the \n\n\n184 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n\nbe  said  to \nbewail  the \ndeath  he \nproduces. \n\n\npart  in.  question,  and  one  not  treated  by  Ezekiel  in  this \n\nplace.     He  speaks  of  God's  preached  and  offered \n\nmercy,  not  of  that  secret  and  awful  will  of  his,  by \n\nthe  counsel  of  which  he  ordains  whom  and  what \n\nsort  of  persons  he  wills  to  be  made  capable  of \n\nreceiving,  and  to  become  actual  participants  of \n\nhis  preached  and   offered  mercy.     This   will  of \n\nGod  is  not  the  object  of  our  researches,  but  of \n\nour  reverent  adoration  ;  as  being  by  far  the  most \n\nvenerable  secret  of  the  divine  majesty,  which  he \n\nkeeps  locked  up  in  his  own  bosom,  and  which  is \n\nmuch  more  religiously5  prohibited  to  us,  than  the \n\nCorycian  caves  to  the  countless  multitude. \n\nWhen  now  Diatribe  cavillingly  asks,  'whether \nthe  holy  Lord  bewails  that  death  of  his  people \nwhich  he  produces  in  them  himself?  a  suggestion \ntoo  absurd  to  be  entertained :' \n\nI  answer,  as  I  have  already  done,  we  must \nargue  in  one  wise  concerning  God,  or  the  will  of \n\n\nHoly  Ghost,  and  others  have  not ;  which  is,  in  other  words, \nwhy  is  there  '  an  election  of  grace?' — I  cannot  agree  with \nLuther,  that  we  have  no  right  to  ask  this  question  ;  or,  in \nother  words,  that  the  Scripture  does  not  afford  an  answer  to  it  -, \nfor  here  is  the  secret  of  God. \n\nIf  it  be  asked  why  such  a  man  is  elect,  and  such  a  man  is \nnot  elect,  it  is  most  true,  we  have  no  answer ;  this  is  God's \nsecret j  we  have  nothing  to  do  with  it.  But  if  the  question  be, \nwhy  are  there  elect  and  non-elect,  we  have. to  do  with  it,  and \ncan  give  an  answer  :  it  is  to  the  manifestation  of  God  ;  which  is \nthe  end  of  all  his  counsels,  and  of  all  his  operations. — For \nsome  observations  on  Luther's  accepted  aphorism  '  Quae  supra \nnos,  nihil  ad  nos,'  and  upon  ( his  apparent  setting  out  of  two \nGods,'  with  one  of  which  we  have  nothing  to  do  ;  and  for  the \ncorrect  answer  to  Erasmus's  insidious  question,  'Does  God \ndeplore  &c.'  see  notes  l,  v,  x,  which  follow. \n\ns  Religiosius.~]  ' By  religious  considerations.' — The  multitude \nmight  look  into  the  entrance j  priests  might  enter  into  the \npenetralia :  but  the  multitude  might  not  go  in  to  explore :  if \nthey  did,  they  were  filled  with  terrors ;  appalling  sights  con- \nfounded them  :  just  so,  and  with  still  more  fearful  apprehen- \nsions of  a  religious  nature,  we  are  prohibited,  says  Luther, \nfrom  attempting  to  penetrate  the  secret  of  God.  But  the  ques- \ntion is,  where  this  secret  begins  ?  Luther  says,  '  in  the  fact, \nthat  some  are  touched  by  the  law,,  and  others  not.' \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  185 \n\nGod,  insofar   as  that  will   is  proclaimed  to   us,  s.xxviii. \n\nrevealed,    offered  to  our   acceptance,   made   the \n\nground  of  worship;  and  in  another  wise,  concern- \ning God,  insofar  as  he  is  unproclaimed,  unre- \nvealed,  unoffered,  and  unworshipped.  So  far  as \nGod  hides  himself,  and  chooses  to  be  unknown  by \nus,  we  have  nothing  to  do  with  him.  Here  is  the \ntrue  application  of  that  saying,  c  What  is  above \nus,  is  nothing  to  us/  And  lest  any  one  should \nsuppose  this  to  be  my  distinction,  let  him  know \nthat  I  follow  Paul,  who  writes  to  the  Thessa- \nlonians  concerning  Antichrist  (2  Thess.  ii.  4.) \n\"  That  he  would  exalt  himself  above  all  that  is \nproclaimed  of  God,  and  that  is   worshipped;\"* \n\n1  Super  omnem  Deum prcedicatum  et  cultum.']    Literally,,  f  above \nall  the  proclaimed  and  worshipped  God.'  1  question  the  sound- \nness of  Luther's  interpretation  of  this  text,  and  of  the  argu- \nment   consequently,  which  he  draws   from  it;  although  the \ndistinction  which  he  labours  to  establish  is,  with  some  modifi- \ncation and  amplification,  the  root  of  the  answer  to  the  objec- \ntion.    \"  Who  opposeth  and  exalteth  himself  above  all  that  is \ncalled  God,  or  that  is  an  object  of  worship ,\"  is  the  more  correct \nrendering  of  the  original  text.     The  meaning  seems  to  be,  that \nthis  Antichrist  would  both  oppose  himself  to,  and  exalt  him- \nself above,  every  object  of  worship,  both  true  and  false  ;  '  every \nbeing  that  is  called  God,  and  every  substance  which  is  wor- \nshipped.'    It  has  therefore  nothing  to  do  with  distinct  views \nand  considerations  respecting  the  true  God ;  but  only  marks \nthe  extravagant  claims  which  this  Antichrist  would  make,  and \nwhich  would  be  allowed  by  his  votaries,  as  compared  with  the \nseveral  objects  of  worship  received  in  the  world. — The  word  of \nGod,  however,  doth  clearly  recognise  a  distinction  between \nGod,   regarded  as  the  legislator,  governor,  and  judge  of  his \nmoral  creation — or  in  any  other  relations  which  he  may  have \nbeen  pleased  to  assume  towards  the  whole,  or  certain  parts,  of \nthat  creation — and  God  regarded  as  he  is  in  himself,  and  as \nseparated  from  such  relations  :  as  also,  between  that  will  of \nHis  which  he  hath  revealed  for  our   obedience    (what   may \ntherefore  be  called  his  legislative  will),  and  that  free,  infinite, \nand  eternal  will  of  His,  from  which  this  legislative  will  has \nemanated,  and  by  which,  in  perfect  consistency  with  all  his \nassumed  relations,   and  with  that  of  legislator  amongst  the \nrest,  he   regulates  his  own  conduct  (what  may  therefore  be \ncalled,   by  way  of  distinction,   his  personal   will)  :    in  other \nwords,  between  his  commands  and  his  mind. — God,  who  made \nthe  worlds,  the  alone  Being,  subsisted  in  his  trinity  of  co- \n\n\n186  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  plainly  intimating,  that  a  man  might  be  exalted \nabove  God,  so  far  as  he  is  proclaimed,  and  wor- \n\nequal  persons,  infinite,  and  all-blessed,  before  he  made  them. \nIs  it  presumptuous  to  say  why  he  made  them  ?  Has  he  not \nunequivocally  told  us  ?  His  end  is,  as  it  must  be,  seated  in \nhimself.*  He  will  shew  himself — what  he  is — so  far  as  infinite \ncan  be  shewn  to  finite,  to  certain  moral  and  intelligent  crea- \ntures, whom  he  will  make  capable  of  apprehending,  adoring, \nand  enjoying  him,  in  their  measure.  Hence  the  whole  counsel, \nprocess,  series,  and  results  of  creation  ;  in  which  I  include  all \nthat  belongs  to  Creator  and  creature-ship.  Hence  the  true  dis* \ntinction  between  the  hidden  and  revealed  God  :  which  is \nproperly  no  other  than  God  the  revealer  and  God  the  revealed ; \ncreation  in  this  wide  extent  being  only  God's  revealer  -,  and \nhaving  in  reality  revealed  much  of  him,  whilst  there  is  much \nat  last  in  God  which  is  not,  cannot  be  revealed.  Thus,  we  see \nthat  this  hidden  God,  or  rather  this  absolute  God  (so  called \nbecause  not  circumscribed  by  relations  j  which  relations,  how- \never, can  only  be  such  as  he  has  seen  fit  to  assume ;  and  which \nhe  has  seen  fit  to  assume,  for  the  one  great  end  of  self-manifes- \ntation), is  the  same  God  with  the  revealed  and  circumscribed \nGod  |  and  that,  so  far  from  being  an  unknown  God  in  this \nregard,  he  has  revealed  himself  in  his  relative  and  circum- \nscribed capacity,  for  the  very  purpose  of  making  himself \nknown  (so  far  as  the  incomprehensible  can  be  made  known) \nin  this  absolute  and  uncircumscribed  capacity. \n\nSo,  again,  with  respect  to  his  secret  and  his  revealed  will  -,  or, \nas  I  have  more  correctly  distinguished  them,  his  personal  and \nhis  legislative  will ;  whilst  these  are  distinct,  they  are  neither \nopposed  to  each  other,  nor  unconnected  with  each  other — his \nlegislative  will  subserves  his  personal  will,  and  is  his  ordained \nand  specially-devised  instrument  for  accomplishing  it  :  by \nwhich  accomplishment,  his  great  purpose,  in  submitting  him- \nself to  his  various  creator  relationships  (to  wit,  self- manifest- \nation) is  achieved. f \n\nLuther  does  not  seem  to  have  apprehended  the  union  and \nconcordance  of  these  two  distinct  views,  in  which  both  God \nand  his  will  are  set  forth  to  us,  whilst  he  so  strongly  marks \ntheir  distinctness •  and  thus,  his  answer  (not  being  the  whole \ntruth ;  that  is,  not  being  the  truth  j  which  consists  in  an  har- \nmonious combination  of  many  parts)  has  an  air  of  evasion  and \nsophistry  (to  which  he  seems  not  to  have  been  insensible  him- \nself), and  is,  in  reality,  unsatisfying  and  repulsive.  Is  it  true, \nthat  the  proverb,  '  What  is  above  us,  is  nothing  to  us/  has  its \nrightful  application  here  ?

But,  if  God  be  re- \n\ngarded,   not  as  he  is  an  object  of  worship,  and \n\nas  he  is  proclaimed,  but  as  he  is  in  his  own \nnature  and  majesty,  nothing  can  be  exalted  above \nhim,  but  every  thing  is  under  his  powerful  hand. \n\nGod  must  be  left  to  himself  then,  so  far  as  he \nis  regarded  in  the  majesty  of  his  own  nature ;  for \nin  this  regard  we  have  nothing  to  do  with  him ; \nnor  is  it  in  this  regard  that  he  hath  willed  to  be \ndealt  with  by  us :  but,  so  far  as  he  is  clothed  with \nhis  word,  and  displayed  to  us  thereby;  that  word, \nby  which  he  has  offered  himself  to  our  acceptance; \nthat  word,  which  is  his  glory  and  beauty,  and \nwith  which  the  Psalmist  celebrates  him  as  clothed; \nso  far,  and  so  far  only,  we  transact  with  him.  In \nthis  regard,  we  affirm  that  the  holy  God  does  not \nbewail  that  death  of  his  people,  of  which  he  is \nhimself  the  worker  in  them;  but  bewails  that \ndeath  which  he  finds  in  his  people,  and  is  taking \npains  to  remove  it.  For  this  is  what  the  pro- \nclaimed God  is  about,  even  taking  away  sin  and \ndeath,  that  we  may  be  saved.  For  \"  he  hath  sent \nhis  word  and  healed  them.\"u  But  the  God \nwhich    is   hidden    in   the    majesty   of   his    own \n\ncounsel  of  God,  and  with  an  answer  to  those  very  questions \nwhich  he  says  it  is  not  lawful  to  ask,  or  possible  to  get  resolved. \n\"  What  if  God,  willing  to  shew  his  wrath,  and  to  make  his  power \nknown,  endured  with  much  long  suffering  the  vessels  of  wrath \nfitted  to  destruction :  And  that  he  might  make  known  the  riches \nof  his  glory  on  the  vessels  of  mercy,  which  he  had  afore  prepared \nunto  glory,  even  us,  whom  he  hath  called,  not  of  the  Jews  only, \nbut  also  of  the  Gentiles  ?\" — Luther  both  speaks  and  means \nincorrectly  here ;  but  he  says  rather  more  than  he  means.  It \nis  not  against  the  sober,  hallowed  use  of  the  knowledge  of  this \ninscrutable  will  (for  though  there  be  that  which  is  inscrutable \nin  it,  there  is  also  that  in  it  which  may  be  known,  for  he  has \ntold  it  to  us),  but  against  those  who  denied,  or  confounded,  or \nimpugned,  or  reviled  these  distinctions,  and  would  hear  no- \nthing of  his  sovereign  majesty,  and  of  his  secret  counsel,  that \nhe  is  aiming  his  dart  here. \n\n11  Psalm  cvii.  20.

The  power  which  he  gives  to  his  elect  and  saved,  and \nwhich  he  withholds  from  the  reprobate  and  damned,  is  distinct \nfrom  these  legislative  enactments  ;  and,  whilst  it  proceeds \nfrom  the  relative  God,  proceeds  not  from  him  in  his  legisla- \ntorial relation,  but  in  another,  which  is  distinct  from  and  not \ncommensurate  with  it,  although  its  subjects  be  also  subject  to \nthat  relation,  and  to  its  requirements.  It  is  no  part  of  the \nlegislator's  office  to  give  power,  or  to  withhold  it.  He  may \ndo  either.  He  may  work  any  thing,  every  thing,  upon, \naround,  above,  beneath  him,  so  he  but  leave  the  subject  of \nhis  enactments  a  free  agent :  and  this  God  does,  and  ever  has \ndone. \n\nThus  it  was  in  creation  strictly  so  called  ;  God,  having  assumed \nthe  relation  of  Creator  to  man,  gave  him  a  law  (Gen.  ii.  17.) \n\"But  of  the  tree  of  the  knowledge  of  good  and  evil,  thou \nshalt  not  eat  of  it ;  for  in  the  day  that  thou  eatest  thereof \nthou  shalt  surely  die.\"  It  was  no  part  of  his  relation,  as  Creator, \neither  to  withhold  temptation  from  his  creature,  whom  he  had \n\"  made  upright,\"  <f  in  his  own  image,\"  \"  good,\"  \"  very \ngood  \"  (but,  as  we  have  before  noticed, f  not  having  the  Holy \nGhost,  and  therefore  not  held  as  by  a  chain  to  God,  but  sub- \nsisting in  a  state  of  severance  from  him)  -,  nor  yet  to  sustain \nhim  by  new  powers  (additional  to  those  which  he  had  received \nat  his  creation),  in  a  crisis  of  temptation.  The  result  was  that \nhe  fell ;  and  that  the  whole  human  race  (which  had  been \ncreated  in  him,  and  of  which  the  several  individuals  had  a  dis- \ntinct personal  subsistence  in  him,  and  were  parts  of  his  sub- \nstance, when,  having  first  apostatized  in  heart,  he  did  after- \nwards put  forth  his  hand,  and  did  take,  and  did  eat)  shared  in \nhis  ruin. — It  is  by  the  instrumentality  of  this  law  then,  that \nGod  both  saves  whom  he  personally  wills  to  save,  and  destroys \nwhom  he  personally  wills  to  destroy  :  saving  those  to  whom, \nby  a  super- creation  relation  which  was  given  them  in  Christ \nJesus  before  the  world  began,  he  vouchsafes  his  special  grace; \nand,  destroying  those  from  whom,  in  perfect  consistency  with  all \ncreation  dues  and  obligations,  he  withholds  the  same. \n\n*  By  '  legislative,'  I  shall  be  understood  to  mean  all  which  can  be \ncalled  *  enactment,'  as  given  by  God,  of  whatever  kind ;  whether  to  one \nnation,  or  to  the  whole  world ;  whether  Law  or  Gospel.

For,  when  acting  in  this  character,  he  does  not \n\nbound  himself  by  his  word,  but  has  reserved  to \n\nhimself  the  most  perfect  freedom  in  the  exercise  of \nhis  dominion  over  all  things. \n\nBut  Diatribe  beguiles  herself  through  her  igno- \nrance, making  no  distinction  between  the  pro- \nclaimed God,  and  the  hidden  God  ;  that  is,  be- \ntween the  word  of  God,  and  God  himself.  God \ndoes  many  things  which  he  has  not  shewn  us  in \n\nThus  it  was  in  God's  dealings  with  the  nation  of  Israel,  and \nwith  his  visible  church,  as  for  a  season  co-extensive  with \nthat  nation.  When  now  he  had  formed  the  seed  of  Abraham \ninto  a  nation,  and  had  assumed  the  relation  of  king  to  that \npeople,  he  gave  them  a  law ;  by  which,  instrumentally,  he  kept \nthem  for  his  own,  so  long  as  it  was  his  personal  will  to  keep \nthem,  and  scattered  them  when  it  was  the  counsel  of  his  per- \nsonal will  to  scatter  them.*  By  the  same  law  instrumentally,  He, \nin  their  ecclesiastical  relation,  saved  whom  he  would  save, \nthrough  the  bestowal  of  a  grace  which  was  not  of  their  covenant  ; \nwhilst  he  at  the  same  time  destroyed  whom  he  would  destroy, \nthrough  the  withholding  of  that  grace,  in  perfect  consistency \nwith  the  provisions  of  the  same. \n\nThus  it  is  also  in  the  Gospel  Church,  and  in  the  commanded \npreaching  of  the  Gospel  to  all  nations,  and  tongues,  and \npeople.  God,  in  the  relation  of  the  offended  sovereign  of  the \nhuman  race,  command eth  all  men  every  where  to  repent- \ngiving  them  what  may  be  called  the  law  of  repentance  and \nfaith,  and  demanding  of  them  a  state  of  mind  which  is  suited \nto  their  condition  as  fallen  and  guilty  creatures.  '  Repent  ye, \nand  believe  the  Gospel.' f  By  this  legislative  will  of  his, \ninstrumentally,  he  fulfils  the  counsels  of  his  personal  will ; \nsaving  whom  he  has  predestinated  to  save,  and  destroying \nwhom  he  has  predestinated  to  destroy. \n\n*  Israel,  like  Adam  in  Paradise,  broke  the  law  nearly  as  soon  as  it  was \ngiven  him ;  but,  by  so  doing,  he  prepared  the  way  for  all  God's  future \ndealings  with  him. \n\nf  Implicitly,  but  not  explicitly,  this  is  the  demand,  and  the  alone  demand, \nwhich  God  has  made  upon  man,  even  the  whole  human  race,  since  the  Fall; \nand  shall  continue  to  be  so,  till  his  mystery  be  finished  by  the  Lord's  second \ncoming.  The  form  of  this  demand  has  been  varied,  the  knowledge  of  it  has \nbeen  varied;  the  law,  eminently  so  called, has  been  interposed  to  the  church, \nGod  has  \"  winked  at  times  of  ignorance  ;\"  but  a  Manasseh's  humbledness  of \nmind,  with  a  peradventure  of  mercy — the  only  demand  which,  in  consis- \ntency with  the  recognition  of  those  primary  transactions  in  the  Garden,  and \nwith  the  realities  of  the  case,  could  be  made — is  in  truth  the  only  demand \nwhich  has  been  made  upon  the  sons  and  daughters  of  fallen  Adam,  from  the \nperiod  of  the  ejection  out  of  Paradise  until  now :  a  demand  which  has  served \nto  mark  the  only  difference  that  can  ever  be  found  to  subsist  between  the \nseveral  apostate  members  of  an  apostate  head ;  viz.  continued  apostasy  in \nsome,  and  restoration  in  others. \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  191 \n\nhis  word.  He  also  wills  many  things  which  he  s.xxvnr. \nhas  not  shewn  as  that  he  wills,  in  his  word.  For  ■ \ninstance,  he  wills  not  the  death  of  a  sinner- \naccording  to  his  word,  forsooth — but  he  wills  it \naccording  to  that  inscrutable  will  of  his.  Now \nour  business  is  to  look  at  his  word,  and  to  leave \nthat  inscrutable  will  of  his  to  itself:  for  we  must \nbe  directed  in  our  path  by  that  word,  and  not  by \nthat  inscrutable  will.  Nay,  who  could  direct \nhimself  by  that  inscrutable  and  inaccessible  will? \nIt  is  enough  for  us  barely  to  know,  that  there  is  a \ncertain  inscrutable  will  in  God. — What  that  will \nwills,  why  it  so  wills,  and  how  far  it  so  wills,  are \nmatters  which  it  is  altogether  unlawful  for  us  to  in- \nquire into,  to  wish  for  knowledge  about,  to  trouble \nourselves  with,  or  to  approach  even  with  our  touch. \nIn  these  matters,  we  have  only  to  adore  and  tofear. \nSo  then,  it  is  rightly  said,  c  If  God  wills \nnot  death,  we  must  impute  it  to  our  own  will \nthat  we  perish/  Rightly,  I  say,  if  you  speak \nof  the  proclaimed  God.  For  he  would  have  all \nmen  to  be  saved,  coming,  as  he  does,  with  his \nword  of  salvation  to  all  men ;  and  the  fault  is  in \nour  own  will,  which  does  not  admit  him ;  as  he \nsays,  in  Matt,  xxiii.  \"  How  often  would  I  have \ngathered  thy  children,  and  thou  wouldest  not  m — \nBut  why  this  majesty  of  His  does  not  remove  this \nfault  of  our  will,  or  change  it  in  all  men  (seeing \nthat  it  is  not  in  the  power  of  man  to  do  so);  or \nwhy  he  imputes  this  fault  of  his  will  to  man,  when \nman  cannot  be  without  it;  these  are  questions \nwhich  it  is  not  lawful  for  us  to  ask ;  and  which, \nif  you  should  ask  them,  you  would  never  get \nanswered.  The  best  answer  is  that  which  Paul \ngives  in  Romans  ix.  \"  Who  art  thou  that  repliest \nagainst  God  1\"  Let  these  remarks  suffice  for  this \npassage  of  Ezekiel,  and  let  us  go  on  to  the  rest* \n\nx  Luther  has  in  substance  given  the  right  answer  to  this \ncavil  from  Ezekiel,  but  has  given  it,  as  we  have  seen,  in  an \nexceptionable  form  $  exceptionable,  as  it  respects  the  distinc- \n\n\n192  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.

It  is  to \nbe  remembered,  that  the  words  bear  only  by  inference  and \nconsequence  upon  the  question  of  Freewill  (which  is  the  ques- \ntion in  debate),  whatever  be  the  correct  interpretation  of  them ; \nneither  does  Erasmus  represent  them  fairly.  Erasmus  speaks \nof  wailing  and  working  :  but  where  does  Ezekiel  say  that  God \nff  wails  r\"  He  says  only,  '  I  would  not.'  Erasmus  argues, \nc  God  deplores  5  therefore,  it  is  not  his  doing  that  they  die ; \ntherefore,  it  is  their  own  doing  ;  therefore,  there  is  Freewill.' \nIt  is  inference  two  deep  ;  each  of  which  requires  proof.  What \nif  their  death  be  self-wrought  ?  •  Why  may  they  not  have  pre- \nviously forfeited  their  Freewill,  and  therefore  die  under  bond- \nwill?  We  might  hold  ourselves  excused,  therefore,  from \nentering  at  all  into  this  cavil  3  it  is  truly  nihil  ad  nos. \n\nBut  there  are  reasons  why  we  should  rather  meet  it  in  the \nface  5  and  the  answer  has,  by  implication,  been  given  to  it \nalready. — Some  would  say,  why  not  at  once  knock  it  down \nwith  \"  Secret  things  belong  unto  the  Lord  ?\"  (Deut.  xxix.  29.) \na  convenient  text  for  a  perplexed  disputant !  My  answer  is,  that \ntext  does  not  apply  here.  The  Prophet  is  not  speaking  of  the \nprinciples  of  divine  conduct,  but  of  those  providential  events \nand  arrangements  by  which  God  realizes  and  fulfils  them.  It \nwas  in  the  counsels  of  God  to  bring  the  nation  of  Israel  to \nobedience  at  the  last,  through  a  long  course  of  tergiversation \nand  punishment :  but  they  had  at  that  time  the  word  given  to \nthem  (\"  the  word  is  nigh  thee,  even  in  thy  mouth,  and  in  thy \nheart  ;  that  is,  the  word  of  faith,  which  we  preach.\"  Com- \npare Rom.  x.  5 — 10.  with  Deut.  xxx.  11 — 14.),  which  they \nwould  at  length  obey.  Now,  they  had  nothing  to  do  with \nthese  intermediate  events  which  God  would  bring  about ;  it \nwas  theirs  to  use  that  commandment  (or  rather  that  Gospel \nwhich  the  commandment  fore-preached) — looking  through  the \ntype  to  the  reality — which  he  commanded  them  that  day. — \nBesides,  if  we  were  at  liberty  to  use  this  text  here,  we  must \nlearn  from  it,  that  we  have  nothing  to  do  with  election  and \nreprobation  at  all  :  as  some  are  fond  enough  of  admonishing \nus.  For  it  is  not  a  question,  who  is  individually  of  the  one \nclass,  and  who  of  the  other,  that  is  here  to  be  answered ;  but \nwhether  there  really  be  such  distinctions,  and  why  there  are \nsuch.  (See  above,  note  r.)  — Then  meeting  the  question \nfairly,  though  not  fairly  attached  to  the  question  of  Freewill, \nhow  does  this  assertion  in  Ezekiel  comport  with  the  God- willed \ndeath  of  a  sinner  ? \nNot  to  insist  upon  the  peculiarities  of  the  case  to  which  this \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  193 \n\nings,   expostulations,    upbraidings,   be  seedlings,     sect. \nblessings  and  cursings,   and  all  those  numerous     xxix. \n\n\nture  use- \nless. \n\n\nsolemn  declaration  of  God  is  annexed  (the  house  of  Israel  was  raises,  &c \nbrought  into   peculiar  relations  to  God,   and  the  case   of  an   °f  ScnP \nIsraelite    was    therefore    considerably  different    from    that   of \nuncovenanted  transgressors)  5  not  to  notice  the  ambiguity  of \nErasmus's   expression  '  his  people  '  (God  works  no  death  in \nhis  people  properly  so  called,  though  he  works  death  in  many \n\nwho   have  a  name   to  be  his  people,  and  are  not)  ;  without \n\nj \ninsisting  that  the  original  words  t^pf^  V^H<^  as  well  as  the \n\nt  I        :  i  v     I   <.

At  the \ntwenty-third  verse,*  he  signifies  that  he  has  no  pleasure  in  the \ndeath  of  him  that  dieth  :  in  the  three  last  verses,  he  exhorts \nand  remonstrates,  and  repeats  his  gracious  assurances. — But  it \ndoes  not  belong  to  these  and  such  like  relations,  to  give  grace \nand  power  ;  and,  without  such  grace  and  power,  exhortations \npromises  and  threatenings  are  all,  and  alike,  vain.  But  is \nGod  therefore  to  withhold  them  ?  Man,  without  this  super- \nadded grace,  ought  to  obey  them  5  ought,  though  he  cannot  5 \ncannot,  through  a  self-wrought  impotency.  And  are  there  no \nreasons,  no  satisfying  reasons,  why  God  should  give  them  ?  Are \nnot  these  amongst  his  choicest  instruments,  whereby  he  effects \nthe  manifestation  of, himself ;  manifestation  of  himself,  through \nthe  manifestation  of  what  is  in  man  ;  \"  that  thou  mightest  be \njustified  when  thou  speakest,  and  clear  when  thou  judgest.\" — \nHis  elect  obey  3  his  non-elect  harden  themselves  yet  the  more, \nunder  his  outward  calls. — Thus,  whether  the  case  set  forth  in \nEzekiel  be  considered  as  the  peculiar  case  of  the  national  Israel,  or \n\n*  Erasmus  quotes  the  text  unfairly,  by  joining  the  oath  of  v.  3  with  v,  23 $ \nbut  it  is  no  part  of  it. \n\nO \n\n\n194  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  swarms   of  precepts,   are   without  meaning  ne- \n\ncessarily/  if  no  one  has  it  in  his  power  to  keep \n\nwhat  is  commanded. \n\nDiatribe   is  always  forgetting  the  question  at \nissue,  and  proving  something  different  from  what \nshe  undertook  to  prove:  nor  does  she  perceive, \nhow  much  more  strongly  every  thing  she  says \nmakes  against  herself  than  against  us.     For  she \nproves  from  all  these  passages  a  liberty  and  power \nof  keeping  all  the   commandments,  by   force   of \nthe  inference  which  she  suggests  from  the  words \nquoted;  when   all  the  while  she  meant  only  to \nprove  '  such  a  Freewill  as  can  will  nothing  good \nwithout  grace,  together  with  a  sort  of  endeavour, \nwhich  is  not  to  be  ascribed  however  to  its  own \npowers/     I  see  no  proof  of  such  endeavour  in  any \nof  the  passages  quoted  \\  I  see  only  a  demand  of \nsuch  actions  as  ought  to  be   performed :  what  I \nhave  indeed  said  too  often  already,  if  it  were  not \nthat  such  frequent  repetition  is  necessary,  because \nDiatribe  so  often  blunders  upon  the  same  string/ \nputting  off  her  reader  with  an  useless  profusion  of \nwords, \nsc.  xxx.

Why  have  we  not  at  once  produced \nthis  passage,  and  asserted  Freewill  in  a  field  that \nis  without  opponent.11  What  need  have  we  any \nlonger  of  Christ  ?  what  need  of  the  Spirit  ?

How  foolish  was  Christ \nto  purchase  that  unnecessary  Spirit  for  us  at  the \nprice  of  his  own  out-poured  blood,  that  it  might \nbe  made  easy  to  us  to  keep  the  commandments ; \na  facility,  which  it  now  seems  that  we  possess  by \nnature  !

You  perceive  that  nothing \nat  all  is  affirmed  here,  nor  one  single  syllable \nuttered,  about  facility  or  difficulty,  about  the \npower  or  the  impotency,  of  Freewill  or  of  man, \nto  keep  or  not  to  keep  the  commandment :  except \nthat  those  who  entangle  the  Scriptures  in  the  net \nof  their  own  consequences  and  fancies,  do  thereby \nrender  them  obscure  and  ambiguous  to  themselves, \n\nb  Se  ipsam   comedit.~\\  What  this  animal  is,  and  whether  real \nor  fabulous  ;  I  must  leave  in  some  doubt.

The  animal,  while  it  is  moulting,   is  said  to \nfeed  upon  its  former  stomach,  which  wastes  by  degrees,  and \nis  at  length  replaced  with   a     new  one.' — Bingley's    Animal \nBiography,  vol.  iii.  p.  511.     But  the   pelican  seems  the  more \nprobable  allusion   here ;  whose  method   of  taking   its    suste- \nnance from  its  pouch,  might  well  account    for   the   figment \nof   its  eating   itself,    or  preying   on  its  own  stomach.      The \nscolopendra  discharges  its  own  bowels,  in  order  to  disgorge \nthe  hook ;    and  the  scorpion,    inclosed   with  burning   coals, \nstings  itself  to  death :  but  neither  of  these  seems  applicable \nhere.     The  name  bestia  is  said  to  be  ascribed  properly  to  wild \nand  noxious  animals,  but  not  confined  to  these ;  whilst  bellua \nexpresses  size  rather  than  fierceness. \n\nc  See  Luther's  commentary  on  Deuteronomy,  in  loco  :  where \nhe  notices  and  chides  this  unjustifiable  use,  which  the  Sophists \nmake  of  it.

Moses's  word \ncan  only  be  fulfilled,  he  says,  under  the  Gospel  :  yet  Moses \nsays,  \"  See,  I  have  set  before  thee  this  day  life  and  death,  &c.\" \nThen  what  more  natural,  than  to  understand  him  as  calling \nupon  them  to  see  the  Gospel  in  their  Law,  and  to  yield  a  gospel \nobedience  to  that  Law  ?  which  every  spiritual  Israelite  no \ndoubt  did. \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  197 \n\nfor  the  purpose  of  making  what  they  please  of  sc.  xxx. \n\nthem.     But  now,  if  you  have  no  eyes,  turn  your  \n\nears  at  least  to  what  is  here  spoken,  or  strike  your \nhand  over  the  letters/  Moses  says,  'it  is  not \nabove  thee,  nor  placed  afar  off,  nor  seated  in \nheaven,  nor  beyond  the  sea/  What  is  the  mean- \ning of  '  above  thee?'  'afar  off?'  'seated  in \nheaven?'  'across  the  sea?'  Will  they  even \nmake  our  grammar  and  the  commonest  words  ob- \nscure to  us,  till  they  make  it  impossible  for  us  to \nsay  any  thing  that  is  certain;  just  to  carry  their \npoint,  that  the  Scriptures  are  obscure  ? \n\nAccording  to  my  grammar,  it  is  not  quality \nor  quantity  of  human  strength,  but  distance  of \nplace,  which  is  meant  by  these  words.  It  is  not  a \ncertain  power  of  the  will,  but  a  place  which  is \nabove  us,  that  is  expressed  by  '  above  thee.'  So \nthe  words  '  afar  off,'  '  across  the  sea,'  '  in  heaven,' \ndo  not  denote  any  power  in  man,  but  a  place  re- \nmoved from  us  upwards,  to  the  right  hand,  to  the \nleft  hand,  backwards  or  forwards.

Assuredly,  this  passage \nproves  them  to  have  been  not  seldom  blind,  were  ^ \nit  but  a  little  child  that  should  sit  in  judgment « \nupon  them. \n\nThen  what  doth  Moses  mean  by  these  most \nobvious  and  most  clear  words,  but  that  he  has  dis- \ncharged his  office  as  a  faithful  lawgiver  to  perfec- \ntion? Having  brought  it  to  pass  that  there \nshould  be  no  cause,  why  they  did  not  know,  and \nhave  in  array  before  them,  all  the  commands  of \nGod ;  and  that  no  place  should  be  left  to  them \nfor  urging  by  way  of  excuse,  that  they  did  not \nknow  or  had  not  commandments,  or  must  seek \nthem  from  some  other  quarter.  The  effect  of \nwhich  would  be,  that,  if  they  should  not  keep \nthem,  the  fault  would  be  neither  in  the  law,  nor \nin  the  lawgiver,  but  in  themselves ;  since  they \nhave  the  law,  and  the  lawgiver  has  taught  them, \nso  that  there  is  no  plea  of  ignorance  remaining \nfor  them,  but  only  a  charge  of  negligence  and  of \ndisobedience.  '  It  is  not  necessary/  says  he,  c  to \nfetch  laws  from  heaven'  or  from  the  parts  beyond \nthe  seas,  or  from  afar  off;  nor  canst  thou  pretend \neither  that  thou  hast  not  heard  them,  or  that \nthou  dost  not  possess  them  :  thou  hast  them  near  to \nthee,  they  are  what  thou  hast  heard  by  the  com- \nmand of  God  from  my  lips ;  thou  hast  understood \nthem  with  thine  heart,  and  hast  received  them  to \nbe  read  and  expounded  by  the  mouth  of  the \nLevites/  which   are  in  the  midst  of  thee,   con- \n\nf  Tractandas  accepisti.~\\  In  Deut.  xxxi.  9 — 13.  the  ordinance \nis,  (C  And  Moses  wrote  this  law  and  delivered  it  to  the  priests, \nthe  sons  of  Levi,  which  bare  the  ark,  the  covenant  of  the  Lord, \nand  unto  all  the  elders  of  Israel.

These  texts  indeed,  if  they  prove  any \nthing,  through  the  addition  of  consequences  and \nsimiles  which  are  the  invention  of  human  reason, \nprove  that  Freewill  possesses  not  only  endeavour, \nor  some  small  particle  of  desire;  but  an  entire \npower  and  the  freest  ability  to  do  all  things,1 \nwithout  the  grace  of  God,  and  without  the  aid  of \nhis  Holy  Spirit. \n\nSo  that  nothing  is  further  from  the  thing  proved \nby  this  whole  discourse,  trodden  into  us,  as  it \nhas  been,  by  continual  repetitions,  than  the  propo- \nsition which  she  had  undertaken  to  prove ;  namely, \nc  that  approvable  opinion,  by  which  Freewill  is \ndetermined  to  be  so  impotent  that  it  can  will \nnothing  good  without  grace,  and  is  compelled  to \nserve  sin,  and  possesses  endeavour  which  is  not  to \nbe  ascribed  to  its  own  energies  : 9  a  monster  for- \nsooth, which  can  at  the  same  time  do  nothing  by \nits  own  energies,  yet  possesses  a  power  of  endea- \nvouring, in  its  own  energies ;  and  so  consists  by \na  most  manifest  contradiction.* \nsect.

(If \nall  things  are  done  by  necessity,  says  she,  might \nnot  Jerusalem  have  justly  answered  the  Lord, \nWhy  consume  thyself  with  vain  tears?

Why,  here \nis  proved  a  will  that  is  free,  every  whit  whole, \nand  able  to  do  every  thing  wThich  the  Prophets \nhave  spoken !  Diatribe  did  not  take  upon  herself \nto  prove  this  sort  of  will  in  man.  Nay,  let \nDiatribe  herself  be  the  respondent  here,  and  let \nher  tell  us  why,  if  Freewill  cannot  will  good,  it \nis  imputed  to  her  that  she  did  not  hear  the  Pro- \nphets ;  whom,  as  being  teachers  of  good,  it  was \nnot  possible  for  her  to  hear,  through  her  own \nstrength  ?  Why  does  Christ  weep  vain  tears,\"1  as \nthough  they  could  have  willed,  what  he  assuredly \nknew  that  they  could  not  will  ?  Let  Diatribe \ndeliver  Christ  from  a  charge  of  madness,  I  say, \nin  support  of  that  approvable  opinion  of  hers,  and \nstraightway  our  opinion  will  have  been  liberated \nfrom  this  Achilles  of  the  flies.     So  that  this  text \n\nm  Luther  seems  to  have  confounded  this  passage  in  Matt, \nxxiii.  with  Luke  xix.  41 — 44.  <c  And  when  he  was  come  near,,  he \nbeheld  the  city,  and  wept  over  it.\"  &c:  &c.  It  is  remarkable \nthat  the  words  which  are  so  closely  parallel  in  Luke  xiii.  were \nnot  spoken  at  the  same  time  with  those  recorded  in  Matt,  xxiii. \nThe  latter  were  spoken  in  the  Temple  at  the  close  of  the \nLord's  public  ministry  :  the  former,  whilst  he  was  yet  in \nGalilee. \n\n\n202  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  of  Matthew  either  proves  a  complete  Freewill,  or \n\nfights  against  Diatribe  herself,  as  stoutly  as  against \n\nus,  and  lays  her  prostrate  with  her  own  weapons.\" \nI  assert,  as  I  have  done  before,  that  the  secret \nwill  of  God,  as  regarded  in  the  majesty  of  his \nown  nature,  is  not  matter  of  debate  ;°  and  that \nthe  rashness  of  man,  which,  through  a  continual \nperverseness,  is  always  leaving  necessary  topics \nto  attack  and  encounter  it,  should  be  called  away \nand  withdrawn  from  occupying  herself  in  scruti- \nnizing those  secrets  of  His  majesty,   which  it  is \nimpossible  to  penetrate,?  seeing  He  dwelleth  in \nlight  which  no  man  can  approach  unto ;  as  Paul \ntestifies.    (1  Tim.  vi.  16.)     Let  her  rather   occupy \nherself  with  the  incarnate  God,  or  (as  Paul  speaks) \nwith  Jesus  the  crucified :    in  whom  are  all  the \ntreasures  of  wisdom  and  knowledge,  but  hiddenly.q \nHe  will  teach  her  abundantly  what  she  ought  to \nknow,    and  what  not.     It  is   the  incarnate  God \nthen,  which  speaks  here.      CJ  would,    and  thou \nwouldest  not.'     The  incarnate  God,  I  say,  was \nsent  into  the  world  for  this  purpose,  that  he  might \nbe  willing,  that  he  might  speak,   that  he  might \ndo,  that  he  might  suffer,  that  he  might  offer r  all \n\n\nn  Suo  Mam  jaculo.~\\  Nothing  less  than  a  complete  Freewill \ncan  repel  the  objection  here  brought  by  Diatribe  :  therefore, \neither  there  is  a  complete  Freewill — which  she  denies- — or  all \nsuch  objections  have  no  weight  at  all. \n\n°  Luther  expresses  this  more  briefly,  but  obscurely:  'de \nsecreta  ilia  voluntate  majestatis  non  esse  disputandum.'     . \n\np  Scrutandis.  attingere.^  Send,  comes  nearest  to  our  c  rum- \nmage :'  f  videtur  esse  a  scrutis,  quasi  sit  ita  in  loco  aliquo \npraetentare,  et  versare  omnia,  ut  etiam  scruta  misceantur.' \nHence  applied  to  a  dog  hunting  by  the  scent. .  It  expresses \nthe  search  for  a  thing,  rather  than  the  improper  handling  of \nthe  thing  found.  So  Luther  applies  it  here  j  as  is  plain  from \n{ attingere  : '  '  the  attaining  to,  or  reaching  the  thing  which \nwas  gone  after.' \n\ni  See  1  Cor.  i.  23.  ii.  2.

Christians  know,  that  every  thing \nwhich  was  done  by  the  Prophets  was  done  by \nthem  in  the  name  of  that  Christ  which  was  to \ncome;  of  whom  it  had  been  promised  that  he \nshould  become  the  incarnate  God.  So  that  what- \nsoever has  been  offered  to  man  by  the  ministers \nof  the  word  from  the  beginning  of  the  world,  may \nbe  rightly  called  the  will  of  Christ.3 \n\n6  Luther  gives  two  answers  to  this  cavil  from  Matt,  xxiii. — \n1.  It  is  equally  inconsistent  with  Diatribe's  statement.  \\  2.  It \nis  the  incarnate  God,  not  the  God  of  Majesty,  who  here \nspeaks.  I  must  strongly  object  to  this  latter  solution.  It  im- \nplies a  difference,  nay  a  contrariety,  between  the  mind  of \nGod  and  the  mind  of  Christ ;  and  thus  destroys  the  very  end \nfor  which  Christ  came — even  the  manifestation  of  God  as  His \nexpress  image — by  not  only  negativing  the  fulfilment  of  that \ndesign,  but  absolutely  intimating  that  he  has  given  us  false \nviews  of  God,  by  shewing  a  mind  which  is  the  reverse  of  His  : \nas  though  He  willed  salvation,  where  God  wills  destruction. \nYet  he  tells  us,  ' '  I  came  not  to  do  mine  own  will  but  the  will \nof  Him  that  sent  me.\"  \"  My  meat  is  to  do  the  will  of  Him \nthat  sent  me,  and  to  finish  his  work.\"     \"  I  do  nothing  of  my- \n\n\n204  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.

(See  Sect,  xxviii.  notes  l  v  x.)  God \nstanding  in  peculiar  relations  to  Israel,  as  his  typical  nation \nand  his  visible  church,  had  from  the  beginning  been  calling \nthat  people  to  repentance.  Their  history,  their  institutions, \ntheir  lively  oracles,  their  ordinary  and  extraordinary  ministers, \nhad  caused  them  to  be  peculiarly,  and  above  the  rest  of  man- \nkind, without  excuse,  even  before  Christ  came.  These  were \nso  many  '  I  woulds,  and  ye  would  nots  :'  not  Christ  saying \nand  willing  one  thing,  and  the  Father  another ;  but  ]  Christ \nby  the  Father's  commandment  calling  to  them,  and  they  re- \nfusing. But  now  he  had  come  personally  and  visibly  amongst \nthem,  and  could  say,  ' ( If  I  had  not  come  and  spoken  unto  them, \nthey  had  not  had  sin,  but  now  they  have  no  cloak  for  their  sin. \nHe  that  hateth  me,  hateth  my  Father  also.

And  what  is  all  this, \nbut  God  in  certain  assumed  relations  uttering  his  voice  to  those \nconnected  with  him  by  these  relations  (in  other  words,  declar- \ning his  legislative  will),  which  those,  to  whom  it  is  uttered, \nought  without  doubt  to  obey  ;  and  which  if  they  did  obey,  they \nwould  according  to  his  promise  live.  But  '  ought  to  obey'  is \nnot  '  therefore  have  power  to  obey  ;'  and  f  have  not  power  to \nobey,'  is  not  '  therefore  the  command  is  given  in  vain.'

But  it  was \nonly  by  a  grace  not  belonging  to  those  relations  by  which  God \nhad  at  that  period  connected  himself  with  Israel,  that  Israel \ncould  then  have  been  made  willing  :  he  had  all  given  to  him \nwhich  belonged  to  those  relations ;  to  withhold  trial,  or  to \nadminister  super-creation  and  super-covenant  grace  that  he \nmight  stand,  was  no  part  of  the  dues  which  God  had  made \nhimself  debtor  to  him  to  perform  -,  and  therefore  Israel — justly, \nand  no  more  than  justly,  tried — having  manifested  what  was  in \nhim  with  such  aggravations  of  guilt,  incurred  a  sentence  which \nis  declared  to  have  been  the  requital  of  all  the  righteous  blood \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  205 \n\nyou  have  discovered  :  so  then,  as  often  as  you  are     sect. \npressed  by  the  force  of  your  adversary's  argu-  ' \n\ntli.it  had  been  shed  upon  the  earth  from  Abel  to  Zecharias. \n(vv.  35,  36.) — The  guilt  of  that  generation  was  indeed  ex- \ntreme ;  but  who  shall  say  that  it  was  not  the  concentrated \nguilt  of  the  intermediate  ages  and  generations  of  that  people,, \ntogether  with  their  own,  which  was   so  shortly  to  be  visited \nupon  them  ?

But  where  is  the  contradiction  to  Scripture  and  right \nreason  in  understanding  God  himself  to  be  moved  with  com- \npassion at  the  very  grief  and  pain  which  He  in  just  judgment \ninflicts  ?       cc  Therefore     my   bowels    are    troubled   for    him.\" \n\"  Have  I  any  pleasure  at  all  in  the  death  of  him  that  dieth  ?\" \n\"  For  he  doth  not  afflict  willingly,  nor  grieve  the  children  of \nmen.\" \n\nIt  is  pleasing  to  notice,  how  nearly  Luther  approximates  to \nthe  truth — viz.  e  That  Christ  was  eternally  fore-ordained  as \nChrist,  and  did  by  a  covenant  subsistence  assume  his  person \nand  personal  relations,  as  the  risen  God-man,  before  the  foun- \ndation of  the  world' — in  the  defence  which  he  makes  against \nthe  cavil,  '  Christ  was  not  yet  come.'  He  declares  that  every \nthing  was  done  by  the  Prophets  in  Plis  name,  and  that,  all \nexpressions  of  mercy  from  the  beginning  may  be  rightly  called \nthe  will  of  Christ :  which  will,  according  to  his  representation \nof  it,  is  perfectly  distinct  from  that  of  the  Father  (his  language \nimplies,  contrary  to  it),  so  that  there  must  have  been  a  dis- \ntinct agency  of  Christ  from  the  beginning.

Christ  forsooth  impinges \nupon  some  of  God's  reprobates ! — Still,  a  hint  or  two  may  be \nborrowed  with  advantage  from  Luther's  statement.  God,  in \naddressing  himself  to  the  world  as  he  does  by  the  '  every  where \nto  be  preached '  Gospel,  does  clearly  set  himself  forth  to  as \nmany  as  have  a  heart  in  any  degree  softened  and  turned  to- \nwards him,  in  the  form  and  character  of  the  Father  of  mercies \nnot  willing  that  any  should  perish.  Such  ought  not  to  be  de- \nterred and  affrighted  by  the  knowledge  that  he  has  his  repro- \nbates. The  melting  heart  is  not  the  heart  of  a  reprobate. \nBut  is  he  to  shut  his  eyes  to  the  fact  that  God  has  his \nreprobates  ?  Nay,  that  fact  combined  with  the  consciousness \nof  his  own  personal  impotency,  turns  unto  him  for  a  testimony. \nNeither  can  he  regard  God  as  he  ought  now,  or  in  any  future \nstage  of  his  experience,  without  it ;  for  without  it,  the  God \nwhom  he  serves  is  not  the  true  God. \n\n1  Epicycles.']  *  A  little  circle,  whose  centre  is  in  the  circum- \nference of  a  greater  :  or  a  small  orb,  which,  being  fixed  in  the \ndeferent  of  a  planet,  carries  it  round  its  own  axis,  whilst  it  is \nitself  carried  round  the  axis  of  the  planet. — An  invention  of \nsome  bungling  philosophers  to  account  for  the  anomalies  of \nplanetary  motion.' \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  207 \n\nPaul  in  Rom.  ix.  \"Why  doth  God  complain  sect. \nthen  ?

In \nother  questions,  where  the  matters  treated  of  are \nsuch  as  admit  of  explanation,  and  such  as  we  are \ncommanded  to  explain,  I  do  not  proceed  so. \n\nNow  if  a  man  will  not  yield  to  my  admonition,  but \npersists  in  scrutinizing  the  counsels v  of  that  will, \n\nu  This  text  does  not  seem  to  bear  upon  the  point  in  hand ; \nviz.  that  we  ought  not  to  scrutinize  the  personal  will  of  God  ; \nor,  as  he  terms  it,  ' the  will  of  majesty/  or  sovereignty. \nLuther  understands  e  their  seeking  of  God  daily,  and  desiring \nto  know  his  ways,  and  asking  of  him  the  ordinances  of  justice  j \nas  if  they  not  only  complained  of  God's  appointments  towards \nthem  being  unjust,  but  were  prying  curiously  into  the  secret \nsprings  of  them.  But  does  God,  speaking  by  his  Prophet, \nreally  mean  any  more  than  that  they  were  hypocrites  and \nformalists,  yet  expected  the  acceptance  of  true  and  devout \nworshippers  ?

Thus  it  is  with  the  Scriptures  also :  what \nmay  be  done  in  us  by  the  power  of  God,  and \nwhat  we  cannot  do  of  ourselves,  is  declared  by \nsuch  like  words. \n\nBesides,  if  such  things  were  said  about  actions \nabsolutely  impossible,  as  those  which  even  God \nalso  would  never  at  any  time  do  by  us,  then \nwould  they  be  rightly  called  either  cold  or  ridi- \nculous, as  being  said  to  no  purpose.  But  the \ntruth  is,  these  expressions  are  used  not  only  to \nshow  the  impotency  of  Freewill,  which  causes \nthat  none  of  these  things  be  done  by  us ;  but  at \nthe  same  time  to  intimate  that  all  such  things  are, \nat  some  time  or  other,  about  to  be  and  to  be \ndone — howbeit  by  another's  power,  even  God's  : \nif  we  quite  admit  that  there  is  in  such  like \nwords  some  intimation  of  things  which  are  to \nbe  done,  and  which  are  possible.

I  should  speak  thus  to \nthose  who  would  not  be  content  to  have  it  said, \nthat  our  impotency  only  is  expressed  by  these \nwords,  but  would  maintain,  that  a  certain  power \nand  ability  of  doing  those  things  wThich  are  en- \njoined, is  proved  by  them.   Thus  it  would  at  once \nbe  true,  that  we  could  do  none  of  the  things  com- \nmanded, and  could   at  the  same  time  do  all  of \nthem;   if  we  should  apply  the  former  assertion  to \nour  own  powers,  the  latter  to  the  grace  of  God.c \n\nThirdly,  Diatribe  is  affected  by  this  consider-  Erasmus's \nation :  '  Where  there  is  such  frequent  mention  objection \nof  good  and  bad  works,  says  she ;  where  there  ceptsPare \nis  mention  of  reward ;  I  do  not  see  how  there  can  given,  and \n\nb  Tropo.']  Any  figurative  mode  of  speech,  as  opposed  to  one \nthat  is  plain,  simple,  and  straight  forward  -,  whatever  be  the \nparticular  nature  of  the  obliquity ;  whether  grammatical,  as \nhere ;   or  rhetorical. \n\nc  Luther  gives  three  answers  to  these  texts.  1.

The  end \nis  not  always  conviction  of  sin  in  mercy ;  sometimes  it  is \n<s  whom  he  will  he  hardeneth  ;\"  but  always,  it  is  man  made \nto  shew  what  he  is,  unto  the  more  perfect  manifestation  of  God \nby  him.

Freewill  has  made  such  advances  during \nthe  growth  of  this  book  and  disputation  of  Dia- \ntribe's, that  now  she  not  only  has  desire  and \nendeavour  for  her  own  (howbeit,  by  a  strength \nnot  her  own);  nay,  she  not  only  wills  and  does \ngood,  but  even  merits  eternal  life ;  because  Christ \nsays  in  the  fifth  of  St.  Matthew  (ver.  12),  \"  Re- \njoice and  be  exceeding  glad,  for  your  reward  is \nabundant  in  the  heavens.\"  Your  reward ;  that  is, \nFreewilPs  reward :  for  so  Diatribe  understands \nthis  text,  making  Christ  and  the  Spirit  to  be \nnothing;  for  what  need  is  there  of  these,  if  we \nhave  good  works  and  merits  through  Freewill  ? — I \nmention  this,  that  we  may  see  how  common  it  is \nfor  men  of  excellent  abilities  to  be  wont  to  show \na  blindness  in  matters  which  are  manifest  to  even \na  dull  and  uncultivated  mind ;  and  how  weak \nan  argument  drawn  from  human  authority  is,  in \ndivine  things  :  where  divine  authority  alone  has \nweight.6 \n\nTwo  distinct  topics  must  here  be  spoken  to : \nfirst,  the  precepts  of  the  New  Testament;  and \nsecondly,  merit.  I  shall  dispatch  each  of  these  in \nfew  words,  having  spoken  of  them  rather  pro- \nlixly on  other  occasions.  The  New  Testament \nproperly  consists  of  promises  and  exhortations, \njust  as  the  Old  properly  consists   of  laws   and \n\nd  Natura,  necessitas.']  By  (  nature/  in  this  connection,  I  sup- \npose he  means  '  an  inherent-,  settled,  constitution  of  things/ \nwhich  produces  actions  involuntarily  :  by  '  necessity,'  '  a  com- \npulsory influence'  exercised  upon  such  a  constitution,  from \nwithout. \n\ne  The  inconsistency  is  Erasmus's  :  his  Freewill  is  necessity  -, \nbut,  according  to  him,  is  the  subject  of  reward. \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  213 \n\nthreatening.  For,  in  the  New  Testament,  the  sect. \nGospel  is  preached ;  which  is  nothing  else  but  a  ' \ndiscourse  offering  the  Spirit,  together  with  grace,  verted  not \nunto  that  remission  of  sins  which  hath  been  to  those  in \nobtained  for  us  by  the  crucifixion  of  Christ :  and  Freewi11- \nall  this  gratuitously,  because  the  mercy  only  of  God \nthe  Father  befriends  us,  unworthy  as  we  are,  and \ndeserving  damnation,  as  we  do,  rather  than  any \nthing  else.  Then  follow  exhortations,  to  stir  up \nthose  who  are  already  justified,  and  have  obtained \nmercy,  unto  a  strenuousness  in  bringing  forth  the \nfruits  of  that  freely  bestowed  righteousness  and \nof  the  Spirit,  and  unto  the  acting  of  love  in  the \nperformance  of  good  works,  and  unto  the  bearing \nof  the  cross  and  of  all  the  other  tribulations  of \nthe  world  with  a  good  courage.  This  is  the  sum \nof  all  the  New  Testament. — How  entirely  ignorant \nDiatribe  is  of  this  matter,  she  abundantly  shows \nin  not  knowing  how  to  make  the  least  difference \nbetween  the  Old  Testament  and  the  New ;  for \nshe  sees  almost  nothing  in  either,  save  laws \nand  precepts,  by  which  men  are  to  be  formed  to \ngood  manners.  What  new  birth  is ;..  what  re- \nnewal, regeneration,  and  the  whole  work  of  the \nSpirit ;  she  sees  not  at  all :  to  my  utter  wonder \nand  astonishment,  that  a  man  who  has  laboured \nso  long  and  so  studiously  in  the  Scriptures  should \nbe  so  perfectly  ignorant  of  them. \n\nSo  then,  this  saying,  \"  Rejoice  and  be  exceed- \ning glad,  for  much  is  your  reward  in  the  hea- \nvens,\" squares  just  about  as  well  with  Freewill  as \nlight  agrees  with  darkness.  For  Christ  therein \nexhorts  not  Freewill,  but  his  Apostles  (who  not \nonly  were  in  a  state  above  Freewill,  as  being \nalready  partakers  of  grace  and  just  persons  ;  but \nwere  even  established  in  the  ministry  of  the  word; \nthat  is,  in  the  highest  station  of  grace),  to  bear  the \ntribulations  of  the  world.  But  we  are  engaged \nin  discussing  Freewill,  specially  as  she  subsists \nwithout  grace;  who  is  instructed  by  laws  and \nthreatenings  (that  is,  by  the  Old  Testament)  into \n\n\n214  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  the  knowledge  of  herself,  that  she  may  run  to  the \n\"  promises  set  forth  in  the  New/ \n\nf  Such  is  Luther's  representation  of  the  New  Testament  as \ncontrasted  with  the  Old,  and  of  the  Gospel.  The  New  is \n'  promises  and  exhortations  }'  the  Old  is  '  law  and  threaten- \ning.'  The  Gospel  is  '  the  Spirit,  and  grace  unto  salvation, \noffered  to  all  men ;  through  Christ,  who  died  for  all.'* — For \nsome  objections  to  this  statement,  as  it  respects  '  offers  of \ngrace,'  see  above,  Sect,  xxiii.  note  a;  as  it  respects  the  oppo- \nsition between  the  Law  and  the  Gospel,  see  above,  Sect.  xxiv. \nnote  \\ — The  Gospel  is  certainly  to  be  preached  to  all ;  to  the \nreprobate  as  well  as  to  the  elect ;  but  with  what  propriety  this \ncan  be  called  '  an  offer  of  grace '  to  all,  or  to  any,  may  be  fairly \nquestioned  :  much  more,  with  what  consistency  such  language \ncan  be  used  by  one  who  so  stoutly  maintained,  as  Luther  did, \nboth  the  impotency  of  the  natural  man,  and  the  God-made \ndifference  between  the  elect  and  the  reprobate.  With  such  views \nas  Luther  had  of  the  atonement,  as  though  Christ  had  shed  his \nblood  for  those  from  whom  it  was  the  Father's  good  pleasure \nto  hide  the  mysteries  of  his  kingdom  -,  and  with  such  a  want \nof  insight  into  the  first  principle  of  divine  counsel,  operation, \nand  revelation — even  God's  design  of  manifesting  himself  5 \nin  short,  with  such  a  want  of  insight  into  God  3  it  was  im- \npossible that  he  should  not  speak  inconsistently.  Indeed  it \nwould  be  little,  if  inconsistency  were  all.  Such  language  is \nillusive,  perplexing,  and  subversive  to  man  j  and,  whilst  it \naims  to  beautify  God,  defames  him  !  He  is  correct,  however, \nto  some  considerable  extent :  he  nobly  asserts,  that  salva- \ntion is  altogether  gratuitous,  the  produce  of  the  Father's \nmercy,  conferred  upon  the  hell- deserving  through  the  alone \nmerit  of  Christ's  death.  He  nobly  asserts,  that  the  precep- \ntive parts  of  the  New  Testament  are  for  the  called  and  jus- \ntified only. — But  why  is  the  Old  Testament  to  be  thus  set  in \narray  against  the  New  ?  Where  is  '  the  law  and  threaten- \nings '  in  the  book  of  Genesis  ?  What  more  truly  Evangelical \nWords  are  to  be  found  in  the  New  Testament,  than  in  Isaiah \nand  the  other  Prophets  ;  in  the  Psalms,  and  in  Luther's  favour- \nite book  of  Deuteronomy  ?  f  The  Old  Testament,  as  our \n7th  Article  wisely  speaks,  is  not  contrary  to  the  New  :  for \nboth  in  the  Old  and  New  Testament  everlasting  life  is  offered \nto  mankind  by  Christ,  who  is  the  only  mediator  between  God \nand  man,  being  both  God  and  man.' — The  truth  is,  even  the \nLaw  itself,  as  I  have  already  remarked,  is  ' Gospel  in  enigma/ \nand  the  scribe  that  is  instructed  in  the  New  Testament  finds \nthe  Old  its  best  commentator  and  confirmerj  what  has  in- \nstructed the  same  family  in  its  tenderer  years,  and  now  makes \nthe  \"  young  men\"  perfect. — I  should  speak  rather  differently \n\n*  Note,  he  distinguishes  between  the  Spirit  and  grace,  though  not  very \ncorrectly ;  it  is  the  Spirit  as  given  to  the  justified,  of  which  he  speaks :  but \nthis  is  part  of  the  grace  of  God ;  that  is,  \"  of  the  things  which  are  freely \ngiven  to  us  of  God.\" \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  215 \n\nBut  as  to  merit,  or  a  reward  being  proposed,     sect. \nwhat  is  this  but  a  sort  of  promise?     This  proves   XXXVIL \nnot  that  we  have  any  power;  for  nothing  else  is  Merit  and \nexpressed  by  it,  but  that,  if  a  man  shall  have  done  reward \nthis  or  that  thing,  then  he  shall  have  a  reward.  ™ayc.°£- \nBut  our  question  is,  not  koiv*  a  reward,  or  what  necessity. \nsort  of  a  reward,  shall  be  rendered  to  a  man ;  but \nwhether   we    can    do    those   things   to   which  a \nreward  is  rendered.     This  was  the  thing  to  be \nproved.     Is   it    not    a    ridiculous   consequence  : \nThe  reward  of  the  judge  is  proposed  to  all  that \nare  in  the  course;  therefore  all  can  run  and  ob- \ntain ?     If  Caesar  shall  have  conquered  the  Turk, \nhe  shall  enjoy  the  kingdom  of  Syria:    therefore \nCaesar  can  conquer,  and  does  conquer  the  Turk. \nIf  Freewill  rules  over  sin,  it  shall  be  holy  to  the \nLord ;  therefore  Freewill  is  holy  to  the  Lord. — \nBut  I  will  say  no  more  about  these  superlatively \nstupid  and  palpably  absurd  reasonings  ;  save,  that \nit  is  most  worthy  of  Freewill  to  be  defended  by \nsuch  exquisite  arguments.     Let  me  rather  speak \nto  this  point ;  that  c  necessity  has  neither  merit, \n\nof  the  Apostles.  They  were  to  be  what  he  describes,  with \nthe  exception  of  one  of  them ;  but  they  ivere  not  this  yet. \nIf  they  could  be  truly  said  to  know  Christ  at  all,  till  the  day \nof  Pentecost  was  fully  come,  they  knew  him  \"  after  the  flesh.\" \n(2  Cor.  v.  16.)  But  it  is  not  to  the  Twelve  exclusively,  that \nthe  Lord  addresses  these  words  (Matt.  v.  12.),  nor  of  them \nexclusively  that  he  speaks.  His  precepts  were  for  the  regu- \nlation of  their  conduct,  and  of  the  conduct  of  all  his  converted \npeople  (whilst  walking  through  the  wilderness  of  this  world \nin  his  kingdom),  as  they  should  hereafter  be  called,  one  by  one, \ninto  vital  union  with  him  :  that  union,  of  which  his  elect  have \nthe  sacrament  in  their  baptism,  but  the  reality,  when  either \nbefore  or  after  the  receiving  of  that  sacrament,  the  Spirit  has \nbeen  given,  to  convert  and  to  dwell  in  them. — Luther's  argu- \nment, however,  is  not  shaken  by  this  distinction.  The  Lord \nspeaks  as  to  real  members  of  his  kingdom  ;  to  persons  there- \nfore, who  are  above  and  beyond  that  state  of  Freewill  which  is \nthe  matter  of  dispute. — Already  Luther  has  shewn  Erasmus  in- \nconsistent with  himself  in  arguing  from  this  text  (see  Sect. \nxxxv.)  :  his  second  answer  is,  '  this  text  (to  which  all  other \nNew  Testament  precepts  might  be  added)  does  not  apply.' \n\n*  Quo  modo.~]  How,  in  point  of  action  5  what  he  must  do ; \nthat  he  may  be  entitled. \n\n\n216  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  n0r  reward/  If  we  speak  of  a  necessity  of  com- \n'  pulsion,  it  is  true  :  if  we  speak  of  a  necessity  of \nimmutability,  it  is  false.11  Who  would  give  a \nreward,  or  impute  merit,  to  an  unwilling  work- \nman? But  to  those  who  wilfully  do  good  or  evil, \neven  though  they  cannot  change  this  will  by  their \nown  power,  there  follows,  naturally  and  neces- \nsarily, reward  or  punishment;  as  it  is  written, \n\"  Thou  wilt  render  unto  every  man  according  to \nhis  works.\"  It  follows  naturally,  '  if  you  plunge \ninto  water,  you  will  be  suffocated ;  if  you  swim \nout,  you  will  save  your  life.' \n\nTo  be  brief;  in  the  matter  of  merit,  or  reward, \nthe  inquiry  is  either  about  the  worthiness,  or \nabout  the  consequence,  of  actions.  If  you  look \nat  worthiness,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  merit ; \nthere  is  no  such  thing  as  reward.  For,  if  Free- \nwill can  will  nothing  good  of  itself,  and  wills  good \nonly  through  grace  (we  are  speaking,  you  know, \nof  Freewill  as  separate  from  grace,  and  are  in- \nquiring what  power  is  proper  to  each),  who  does \nnot  see  that  this  good  will,  together  with  its \nmerit  and  its  reward,  is  of  grace  only?  And \nhere  again,  Diatribe  is  at  variance  with  herself  in \narguing  the  freedom  of  the  will  from  merit,  and \nis  in  the  same  condemnation  with  me  whom  she \nopposes :  since  it  fights  equally  against  herself \nas  against  me,  that  there  is  merit,  that  there  is \nreward,  that  there  is  liberty;  after  she  has  asserted, \nas  she  does  above,  that  Freewill  can  will  nothing \ngood,  and  has  undertaken  to  prove  such  a  sort  of \nFreewill. \n\nIf  you  look  at  the  consequences  of  actions, \nthere  is  nothing  either  good  or  bad,  which  has  not \nits  reward.  And  we  get  into  mistakes  from  this \ncause,  that,  in  speaking  of  merits  and  rewards, \nwe  agitate  useless  considerations  and  questions \nabout  the  worth  of  actions — which  is  none — when \n\nh  For  this  distinction,  see  above,  Part  i.

But  the  sons  of  God  do  good  through  a \ngratuitous  good  pleasure ;  not  seeking  any  re- \nward, but  simply  seeking  the  glory,  and  aiming \nto  do  the  will,  of  God  :  they  are  prepared  to  do \ngood,  even  though  according  to  an  impossible \nsupposition,  there  were  no  such  thing  as  either \nkingdom  or  hell-fire.  I  think  these  things  are \nquite  sure  from  that  single  saying  of  Christ  in \nMatt.  xxv.  \"  Come  ye  blessed  of  my  Father, \nreceive  the  kingdom,  which  hath  been  prepared \n\n1  Detestentur,  execrentur .~]  For  proper  meaning  of  '  detes- \ntor,'  see  above,  Part  i.

Not  content  with  seeking  their  own \nglory,  &c.  &c.  in  their  dealings  with  man,  they  seek  it  even \nfrom  the  hands  of  God  :  He  is  to  do  them  good,  not  himself. \n\n\n218  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  for  you  from  the  foundation  of  the  world/5     How \n\n■  do  they  earn  that,  which  is  even  now  theirs,  and \n\nwhich  was  prepared  for  them  before  they  were \nborn  ?  So  that  we  should  speak  more  correctly, \nif  we  should  say,  the  kingdom  of  God  doth \nrather  earn  us  for  its  possessors,  than  we  it  ; \nplacing  merit  where  they  place  reward,  and \nreward  where  they  place  merit.  For  the  king- \ndom is  not  to  be  prepared,  but  hath  been  pre- \npared ;  but  the  children  of  the  kingdom  are  to  be \nprepared,  not  themselves  to  prepare  the  king- \ndom: that  is,  the  kingdom  earns  her  children, \nnot  the  children  the  kingdom.  Hell,  in  like  man- \nner, doth  rather  earn  her  children,  and  prepare \nthem,  than  they  it ;  since  Christ  says,  \"  Depart \nye  cursed  into  everlasting  fire,  which  hath  been \nprepared  for  the  devil  and  his  angels.\"1 \n\n1  Erasmus  objects,  that  e  so  much  mention  of  good  works \nand  reward,  in  Scripture,  is  inconsistent  with  mere  necessity  j \nwhich  can  have  no  merit.' \n\nLuther  answers,  though  not  exactly  in  this  order  :  1.  Merit \nand  reward  are  as  inconsistent  with  your  Freewill  (which  can \nwill  nothing  good)  as  with  mine.  2.  Reward  is  a  matter  of \npromise  $  which  implies  nothing  of  power,  the  alone  thing  in \nquestion.  3.  Merit  and  reward  are  not  inconsistent  with  a \nnecessity  of  immutability,  though  they  be  inconsistent  with  a \nnecessity  of  compulsion.  (See  above,  note  h.)  Merit  is  not \nnecessarily  merit  of  worth  ;  reward  may  be  a  consequence  of \nactions,  in  which  there  is  no  merit  of  worth.  4.  The  king- \ndoms of  heaven  and  hell  earn  their  children,  severally  5  not \nthey  them. \n\nThe  two  first  of  these  answers  are  valid ;  and,  if  it  were \nmerely  so  many  rounds  of  the  boxer,  or  so  many  grapple- \nments  of  the  wrestler,  of  which  we  are  watching  the  result, \nwe  must  give  the  palm  to  Luther :  he  has  supplanted,  he  has \nknocked  down  his  antagonist.  But  we  want  to  hear  some- \nthing against  merit  and  reward  :  and  here,  Luther  is  evasive \nand  subtle  in  his  reasoning,  though  correct  in  his  conclusion. \nNecessity  of  immutability  does  not  necessarily  imply  absence \nof  merit ;  because  that  which  the  will  cannot  do  for  itself,  it \nmay  be  changed  by  another  to  do.  Luther  has  supplied  the \nbasis  of  a  solid  and  satisfactory  answer,  in  his  fourth  reply ; \nwhilst  he  has  neither  opened  it,  nor  appears  to  be  sensible  of \nits  force  and  marrow.

What  xxxvm; \n\nUpon  Luther's  principles,  it  is  impossible  to  give  a  solid  an-  are\"uvo_ \nswer  to  the  objection  of  '  merit.'  For,  if  Christ  has  died  alike  m-iscs  an(j \nfor  all  3  if  he  has  done  and  suffered  the  same  both  for  the  elect  threaten- \nand  for  the  reprobate  5  so  that  there  is  no  difference  between  ings  in \nthem,  as  far  as  respects  his  merit  (which  is  the  essence  of  the  Scripture, \ndoctrine  of  Universal  Redemption)  ;  then,  either  there  must  be \nmerit  in  the  individuals  of  the  elect,  or  there  is  with  God \nrepect  of  persons  :  he  makes  a  different  award  to  some  from \nwhat  he  does  to  others,  alike  meritorious  or  unmeritorious, \nthrough  partiality.  Nor  will  it  suffice  to  say  (as  Luther  does), \nthis  reward  is  mere  matter  of  consequence,  like  the  man  swim- \nming out  of  water,  &c.  God  sees  somewhere  that  which  makes \nit  the  demand  of  His  justice  that  he  should  put  a  difference  : \nand,  since  this  is  not  in  Christ,  it  must  be  in  the  individuals \nthemselves.  The  true  answer  is,  that  God  has  assumed  dis- \ntinct, super-creation  relations  to  his  elect,  in  Christ ;  which \nrender  it  imperative  upon  him  to  give  them  grace  and  glory, \neach  in  its  season.  This  is  the  true  meaning  of  the  kingdom \nof  heaven  earning  her  sons  :  there  are  relations  of  and  be- \nlonging to  that  kingdom,  which  communicate  the  power  that  is \nnecessary  to  the  inheriting  of  that  kingdom,  in  consistency \nwith  all  that  God  is,  and  to  the  manifestation  of  him  as  that \nGod  which  he  is.  So  again,  with  respect  to  the  kingdom  of \nhell :  that  kingdom  has  relations  which  have  procured  its  in- \nhabitants and  inheritors.  The  devil  has  had  a  power  given  to \nhim,  by  which  he  has  drawn  legions  into  his  service,  and \nis  bringing  those  legions  to  be  his  companion  in  torments  -, \nlegions,  not  of  devils  only,  but  of  reprobate  and  accursed  men  : \nfrom  which  number,  as  equally  ruined  by  the  devil  and  self- \ndestroyed  with  the  rest,  the  elect  people  of  God,  through  their \nsuper-creation  relations  to  him  in  Christ,  or,  as  it  has  just  now \nbeen  expressed,  through  the  relations  of  the  kingdom  of  God \n(of  which  God,  of  his  distinguishing  favour,  has  given  to  them \nto  be  members),  are  rescued.  Merit  and  reward  are  made \nnearly  as  much  a  stumbling-block  to  the  maintainers  of  free \ngrace,  as  the  sin  and  impotency  of  the  natural  man  are  to  the \nmerit-mongers  :  with  this  difference,  that  the  stumbling-blocks \nwhich  may  be  thrown  upon  the  path  of  truth  are  superable  and \nremovable,  whilst  falsehood  may  pass  by,  and  cover  over, \nbut  she  cannot  expose  and  expel  her  stumbling-blocks. \nToo  often,  however,  the  sincere  and  strenuous  advocates  of \ntruth  defend  her  cause  weakly,  and  even  dangerously. — Who \nwill  be  satisfied,  for  instance,  with  that  answer  to  an  objection \nbrought  against  the  truth,  which  assumes  that  there  is  no  such \nthing  as  \"  recompense  of  reward\"  in  the  Bible  5  no  soldier's \ncrown  j  no  servant's  wages ;  no  agonistic  palm  ;  no  '  for'  to \nthe  call  of  the  blessed  of  my  Father  5  or  that  all  these  things  and \n\n\n220  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  meaneth  that  word  6  reward/  so  often  repeated  as \nit   is,    throughout  the  Scriptures  ?     \"  Thy  work \n\nsayings  are  resolvable  into  \"what  Christ  personally  hath  done  , \nand  might,  if,  according  to  that  will  of  his  and  of  the  Father's \nwhich  is  represented  as  no  other  than  perfectly  arbitrary,  he \nsaw  fit  to  do  so,  be  bestowed  upon  his  enemies  and  blasphemers, \njust  as  righteously  as  upon  his  servant-friends  ?  (See  John \nxv.  15.) \n\nThe  true  objection  to  merit  and  reward  is,  that,  as  generally \nunderstood  and  represented,  they  suppose  something  of  good \nin  the  natural  man;  in  that  self-ruined,  self-damned,  and  self- \nmade-impotent  thing  which  has  merited  Hell  before  he  was \nborn  into  the  world,  and  can  merit  nothing  but  Hell. — But, \nwhat  now  if  it  please  God  to  give  to  this  self-ruined,  self- \nmade-impotent  thing  new  powers,  under  a  new  relation,  and \nby  a  new  title  ?  Is  there  any  thing  to  prevent  God  from \naccepting  an  equivalent,  if  such  can  be  found,  for  that  punish- \nment which  is  the  just  reward  of  this  his  moral  creature's  sin  -} \nand,  of  his  own  free,  sovereign  and  distinguishing  favour  (as  it \nrespects  the  subject  of  his  infinite,  everlasting,  and  inestimable \nbounty),  placing  him  in  new  relations,  and  endowing  him  with \nnew  capacities  as  the  fruit  of  those  relations  ?  And  why  may  not \nthis  new-made  creature,  so  related,  so  capacitated,  and  so  con- \nnected, act  in  a  manner  worthy  of  those  relations,  and  so  entitle \nhimself  to  those  results  which  the  God  of  all  grace  has  seen \nfit  to  attach  to  the  maintenance  and  fulfilment  of  those  rela- \ntions \\ — This  is  just  the  state  and  case  of  the  eternally  fore- \nknown, elect,  predestinated,  given  and  received  people  of  God, \nin  Christ  Jesus,  their  grace  and  glory  Head.  Contemplated  as \nnow  already  self-destroyed  and  fallen  in  Adam  ;  under  express \nsentence  of  death,  with  all  that  awful  hereafter  which  was \nimplied  though  not  expressed  in  that  sentence  ;  the  Lord  Jesus, \nby  making  himself  sin  for  them,  and  dying  with  them,  renders \nit  consistent  in  God  to  raise  them  up  from  the  dead,  and  to \nbring  them  out  into  a  new  state  of  being,  with  new  relations, \ncapacities,  enjoyments  and  privileges,  in  him.  In  a  figure, \nthey  are  said  to  have  risen  with  Christ ;  in  reality,  the  indubi- \ntability  of  their  future  rising  was  publicly  sealed,  and  manifested \nto  the  whole  world,  by  his  rising  :  I  say  publicly,  because  it \nhad  been  secretly  sealed,  in  the  eternal  covenant  transactions  of \nthe  Three  in  Jehovah,  before  the  worlds.  \"This  is  that  grace \nwhich  was  given  us  in  Christ  Jesus  before  the  world  began.\" \n(2  Tim.  i.  9.)  Regeneration,  in  its  most  correct  view,  is  a \npartial  fulfilment  of  the  personal  resurrection  of  the  Lord's \nelect  :  it  is  the  resurrection  of  the  soul  or  spirit.  u  The  hour \nis  coming,  and  now  is,  when  the  dead  shall  hear  the  voice  of \nthe  Son  of  God,  and  they  that  hear  shall  live.\"  (John  v.  25.) \nBy  it  they  are  brought  into  a  resurrection  state ;  are  shewn  to \nbe  of  those  who  shall  hereafter  rise  with  a  body  like  His,  and \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  221 \n\nhath  a  reward,\"  saith  he.     \"  I  am  thy  exceeding;     sect. \n\n\"VVVVITT \n\ngreat  reward.\"     Again;    \"Who  rendereth  unto  j \n\nare  now  called  to  serve  him  in  an  intermediate  state,,  as  \"  God's \nworkmanship,  created  in  Christ  Jesus  unto  good  works,  which \nGod  hath  before  ordained  that  we  should  walk  in  them.\"'* \n(Ephes.  ii.  10.)  Thus  they  are,  essentially,  grace  receivers  of \ngrace  powers,  called  and  enabled  to  act  in  a  manner  worthy  of \na  grace  reward.  Here  is  reward  then,  not  of  mere  consequence., \nbut  of  merit :  of  merit,  which  has  worth  or  dignity  in  it,  yet  is \nall  the  while  grace ;  free,  distinguishing,  sovereign  grace. \nThus  grace  reigneth  ;  but  it  is  through  righteousness  :  which, \nmeans,  if  the  connection  of  those  words  be  duly  observed,  not \nmerely  through  Christ's  being  personally  righteous ;  but \nthrough,  and  in  a  way  of  righteousness,  as  it  respects  the \npersons  of  his  people.  (Rom.  v.  20,  21.  compare  with  the  whole \nof  Rom.  vi.  which  follows,  specially  from  ver.  14  to  ver.  23.)  — \nMany,  doubtless,  will  cavil  at  this  statement ;  but  it  is  for \nlack  of  distinguishing  things  which  essentially  differ  ;  it  is  for \nlack  of  understanding  the  true  nature,  origin,  design,  consti- \ntuent subjects,  and  provisions  of  the  kingdom  of  God  j  it  is \nfor  lack  of  understanding  that  the  members  of  that  kingdom \nare  persons  already  saved  (ec  Who  hath  saved  us,  and  called \nus  with  an  holy  calling;\"  \"  for  by  grace  ye  are  saved  5\" \n\"unto  us  which  are  saved,  it  is  the  power  of  God\")  5  not \nmen  striving  for  life  to  get  life,  but  already -living  men  5  not \nnatural  men,  but  men  joined  unto  the  Lord,  and  who  are  one \nspirit  with  him  ;  which  constitute  the  reward-earning  commu- \nnity :  concerning  whom,  it  is  God's  glory  that  they,  being \nbrought  out,  as  they  are,  in  the  face  and  heart  of  the  world — \na  world  made  up  of  hypocrites,  or  false  professors  of  his  name, \non  the  one  hand  j  and  of  declared  enemies  and  persecutors  on \nthe  other — \"  should  walk  worthy  of  the  vocation  wherewith \nthey  are  called;\"  \"should  walk  worthy  of  God,  who  hath \ncalled  them  to  his  kingdom  and  glory  ;\"  \"  should  be  counted \nworthy  of  his  kingdom,\"  and  should  manifest  him  to  be  the \nrighteous  God  in  recompensing  rest  (their  consummation  and \nbliss)  to  them,  when  he  recompenseth  tribulation  to  them  that \nhave  troubled  them.\" — If  this  statement  be  duly  apprehended, \n\n*  When  we  speak  of  good  works,  people  are  apt  to  run  immediately  into \nthe  idea  of  law  works,  as  if  the  Ten  Commandments  were  to  be  brought \nback  again :  not  considering,  that  good  is  a  relative  term ;  and  that  good \nworks,  therefore,  must  be  those  which  are  consistent  with  the  relations  under \nwhich  we  stand,  when  performing  them.  If  it  were  possible  for  renewed \nman,  in  the  days  of  his  flesh,  to  keep  the  whole  law,  he  would  not  thereby \ndo  good  works.  The  law  is  for  creation  man ;  the  Gospel  is  for  super- \ncreation  man.  It  is  the  obedience  of  a  redeemed  sinner,  to  which  he  is \ncalled  in  Christ  Jesus  ;  an  obedience  analogous  to  that  fuller  and  more  dis- \ntinct manifestation  of  God,  which  he  has  made  of  himself  in  his  new,  after- \ncreation  kingdom.  To  this  obedience,  as  many  as  have  been  created,  or \nbuilded,  in  Christ  Jesus  from  the  very  first,  as  Abel,  &c,  have  been  called \nand  brought,  according  to  their  measure  of  faith. \n\n\n222  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  in.  every  man  according  to  his  works.\"     And  Paul \ns~ in   Romans   ii.    saith,     \"  To    those   who   by  the \n\npatience  of  good  works  seek  for  eternal   life :\" \n\nand  many  like  sayings. \n\nThe   answer   is,   that  all  these   sayings   prove \n\nnothing  but  a  consequence  of  reward,  and  by  no \n\nmeans  a  worthiness  of  merit : m    that  those,  for- \n\nit  will  give  their  legitimate  force  and  meaning  to  numberless \npassages  of  Scripture,  which  some  bring  forward  to  contradict \nthe  truth  of  God,  and  others  pare  down  and  mutilate  to  main- \ntain it. — The  essence  of  the  distinction  too,  that  the  grace \nwhich  earneth  reward  is  truly  super-creation  grace,  furnishes  a \nsure  test  by  which  to  try  and  convict  hypocrites.  How  com- \nmon is  the  language,  '  O,  I  know  I  have  nothing  that  I  have \nnot  received.'  Yes,  but  how  hast  thou  received  it  ?  Grace  is \nthat  principle  in  the  divine  mind  which  makes  distinctions  : \ngrace  is  not  only  favour,  but  free  favour  ;  not  only  free  favour, \nbut  separating  favour  -,  in  the  case  we  are  considering,  is  sepa- \nrating favour,  shewn  in  a  way  of  mercy  5  that  is,  shewn  to  those \nwho  have  deserved  a  contrary  sort  of  treatment.  Hast  thou \nreceived  then  by  a  new  and  super-creation  title  5  which  puts \na  difference  between  Adam's  alike  self-destroyed  and  wholly- \ndestroyed  sons  ?  Or,  is  it  that  thou  hast  cultivated  thy  natural \npowers  j  or,  if  it  pleaseth  thee  rather,  hast  improved  that  gos- \npel-grace which  is  bestowed  on  all,  and  has  put  all  into  a \ncapacity  of  working  out  their  own  salvation  ?  The  answer \nwill  unmask  the  man :  grace  knows  itself,  and  knows  its \norigin. \n\nIn  asserting  that  the  kingdom  of  hell  has  earned,  and  is  earn- \ning, its  subjects  through  a  power  which  God  has  given  to  the \ndevil,  I  would  be  understood  to  intimate  that  the  devil  could \nneither  be,  nor  continue  to  be,  without  the  will  of  God ;  and \nthat  hell  is  filled  through  his  agency  :  by  which,  in  perfect \nconsistency  with  all  creation  relations  and  obligations,  ruin \nwas  originally  brought  upon  man  ;  and  by  which  he  secures \nand  retains  to  himself  that  spoil,  which  it  is  the  Father's  good \npleasure  that  he  should  carry  off,  to  his  glory. \n\nm  Sequelam  mercedis,  meriti  dignitatem.']  The  expression  seems \ninverted  ;  l  worthiness  of  merit,'  for  merit  which  has  worth  in \nit :  the  meaning  clearly  is  f  reward  follows  as  a  consequence, \nbut  there  is  nothing  of  meritorious  worthiness  in  the  subject.' \nLuther,  in  what  follows,  overstates  the  matter  of  disinterested- \nness j  and  afterwards  virtually  contradicts  himself.  We  are \nnot  called  to  be  insensible  to  the  end,  but  urged  to  keep  it  in \nview  j  and  why,  but  as  a  source  of  encouragement  ?  which  he \npresently  affirms.  What,  indeed,  is  that  f  following  because,1 \nbut  an  admission  of  the  same  thing  ? — The  cure  for  servility \nis,    \"  to  the  praise    of  the  glory    of  his    grace\"--*'  saved \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  223 \n\nsooth,  who  do  good,  do  it  not  through  a  servile  sect. \nand  mercenary  disposition  to  gain  eternal  life,  but  xxvn  ' \nstill  seek  eternal  life ;  that  is,  are  in  the  way  by \nwhich  they  shall  arrive  at  and  obtain  eternal  life. \nSo  that,  to  seek  eternal  life,  is  painfully  to  strive, \nand  with  urgent  labour  to  endeavour,  because  it \nis  wont  to  follow  after  a  good  life.  Now,  the \nScriptures  declare  that  these  things  will  take \nplace,  and  will  follow  after  a  good  or  evil  life;  in \norder  that  men  may  be  instructed,  admonished, \nexcited,  terrified :  for,  as  by  the  law  is  the  know- \nledge of  sin  and  admonishment  of  our  impotency, \nyet  is  it  not  inferred  from  this  law  that  we  have \nany  power  ;  even  so,  we  are  admonished  and \ntaught,  by  those  promises  and  threatenings,  what \nfollows  after  that  sin  and  impotency  of  ours, \nwhich  the  law  has  pointed  out  to  us  ;  but  nothing \nof  worthiness  is  ascribed  by  them  to  our  merit. \n\nWherefore,  as  law  words  stand  in  the  place  of \ninstruction  and  illumination,  to  teach  us  what  we \nought  to  do  i  and,  as  the  next  step,  what  we  can- \nnot do  :  so  words  of  reward,  whilst  they  intimate \nwhat  is  to  happen,  stand  in  the  place  of  exhort- \nation and  threatening,  to  stir  up,  comfort,  and \nrevive  the  godly,n  that  they  may  go  on,  persevere, \nand  conquer,  in  doing  good,  and  enduring  evil, \nleast  they  should  be  weary  or  broken-hearted. \nJust  as  Paul  exhorts  his  Corinthian  converts, \nsaying,  \"  Quit  yourselves  like  men ;\"  \"  knowing \nthat  your  labour  is  not  in  vain  in  the  Lord.\"0 \n\nalready' — c  the  triumph  sure' — '  Christ  magnified  by  my \nbody' — '  God  does  all  our  works  in  us' — f  we  will  do  what \nhe  enables' — '  we  will  suffer  what  he  appoints  to  us' — f  happy \nby  the  way' — '  how  much  more  happy  when  in  my  Father's \nhouse  !

How  beautifully  this  process  is  described  in \nEzek.  xxxiv. ! \n\n°  Luther  quotes  these  words,  as  if  they  were  parts  of  the \n\n\n224  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL \n\npart  in.  Thus  God  revives  Abraham  by  saying,  ?  I  am  thy \nexceeding  great  reward/  Just  as  if  you  should \ncheer  a  person,  by  telling  him  that  his  works \nassuredly  please  God :  a  sort  of  consolation  which \nthe  Scripture  frequently  uses.  Nor  is  it  a  small \ndegree  of  consolation  for  a  man  to  know  that  he \npleases  God ;  though  nothing  else  should  follow \nfrom  it :  which  is,  however,  impossible. \nsect.  All  that  is  said  about  hope  and  expectation \nmust  be  referred  to  this  consideration,  that  the \n\n\nReason       things  hoped   for   will   certainly  take  place ;  al- \nobjects  to   though  godly  men  do  not  hope,  because  of  the \nthis  ac-      things  themselves,  or  seek  such  benefits  for  their \nis  an-'        own  sake.     So  again,  ungodly  men  are  terrified \nswered       and  cast  down  by  words  of  threatening,  which \nthewiiuf  announce   a  judgment  to   come,  that   they   may \nGod.'         cease  and  abstain  from  evil;  that  they  may  not \nbe  puffed  up  ;  that  they  may  not  grow  secure  and \ninsolent  in  their  sins. — Now,  if  reason  should  turn \nup  her  nose  here  and  say,  c  Why  would  God  have \nthese  impressions  to  be  made  by  his  words,  when \nno  effect  is  produced  by  such  words,  and  when \nthe  will  cannot  turn  itself  either  way?  why  doth \nhe  not  perform  what  he  cloth,  without  taking  no- \ntice  of  it   in   the    word    (seeing  he    can   do    all \nthings  without  the   word ;    and   seeing   the   will \nneither  has  more  power,  nor  performs  more,  of \nitself,  through  the  hearing   of  the  word,   if  the \nSpirit  be  lacking  to  move  the  soul   within;   nor \nwould  have  less  power,  or  perforin  less,  though \nthe  word  were  silent,  if  the  Spirit  were  vouch- \nsafed;  since  all  depends    upon   the   power   and \nwork  of  the  Holy  Ghost) ;  my  reply  is,  God  has \ndetermined  to  give  the  Spirit  by  the  word,  and \nnot  without  it,  having  us  for  his  cooperators,  to \nsound   ivithout  what   he  alone   and    by   himself \nbreathes  within,  just  where  he  pleases;  producing \neffects,   which    he    could   no    doubt    accomplish \n\nsame  sentence  :  but  the  one  is  part  of  1  Cor.  xv.  58.  the  other \nof  1  Cor.  xvi.  13. . \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  225 \n\nwithout    the    word,    but    which    it    is    not    his     sect. \n\nXXXIX \n\npleasure   so  to  do.     And  who   are  we,  that  we  m \n\nshould  demand  the  reason  why  God  wills  so  ?  It \nis  enough  for  us  to  know  that  God  wills  so ;  and \nit  becomes  us  to  reverence,  to  love,  and  to  adore \nthis  will,  putting  a  restraint  upon  rash  Reason. \nEven  Christ,  in  Matt.  xi.  assigns  no  other  cause \nfor  the  Gospel  being  hidden  from  the  wise  and \nrevealed  to  babes,  than  that  so  it  seemed  good  to \nthe  Father.p  So  he  might  nourish  us  without \nbread,  and  he  has,  in  point  of  fact,  given  us  a \npower  of  being  nourished  without  bread,  as  he \nsays  in  Matt.  iv.  \"  Man  is  not  nourished  by \nbread  alone,  but  by  the  word  of  God.\"q  Still,  it \nhath  pleased  him  to  nourish  us  inwardly  by  his \nword,  through  the  means  of  bread  ;  and  that \nbread  fetched  into  us  from  without/ \n\nIt  stands  good,  therefore,  that  merit  is  not \nproved  by  reward ;  in  the  Scriptures,  at  least  : \nand  again,  that  Freewill  is  not  proved  by  merit; \nmuch  less  such  a  Freewill  as  Diatribe  has  under- \ntaken to  prove  ;  one  which  cannot  will  any  thing \ngood,  of  itself.  For,  if  you  should  even  concede \nthat  there  is  such  a  thing  as  merit,  and  should \n\np  Here  we  are  reminded  again  of  the  defect  of  Luther's \nviews.  It  is  not  arbitrary  will,  but  counselled  will  of  God \naccomplishing  the  best  end  by  just  and  necessary  means, \nwhich  gives  occasion  to  this  arrangement.  The  declaration \nof  his  truth,  by  the  word,  to  the  self-made-impotent  is  neces- \nsary to  the  manifestation  of  himself,  through  his  dealings \nwith  them.  The  \"  Even  so,  Father,\"  would  be  enough  ;  but \nhe  has  been  so  kind  as  to  show  us  more  ;  and  there  are \nplaces  and  seasons  where  this  (  more'  should  be  brought  into \nsight.

The  truth \nmeanwhile  is,  that  God  alone  worketh  both \nmerit  and  reward  in  us,  by  his  Spirit;  but  he \nannounces  and  declares  each  of  these  to  the \nwhole  world,  by  his  outward  word ;  in  order  that \nhis  own  power  and  glory,  and  our  impotency \nand  ignominy,  may  be  proclaimed  even  amongst \nthe  ungodly,  the  unbelieving,  and  the  ignorant ; \nalthough  none  but  the  godly  understand  that \nword  with  the  heart,  and  keep  it  faithfully ;  the \nrest  despising  it. \n\nsec.

And  yet, \nthat  sort  of  Freewill  which  can  will  nothing  good, \nthough  it  be  the  one  in  question,  is  not  proved  by \nthis  consequence  ;  but  that  sort  of  Freewill  which \ncan  do  every  thing ;  which  no  one  contends  for, \nand  which  all  deny,  except  the  Pelagians. — But \nnow,  when  Christ  expressly  says  that  they  know \nnot  what  they  do,  does  he  not  at  the  same  time \ntestify,  that  they  cannot  will  good  ?  For,  how  can \nyou  will  what  you  do  not  know  ?  There  can  be \nno  desire,  surely,  for  an  unknown  thing.  What \ncan  be  more  stoutly  affirmed  against  Freewill, \nthan  that  it  is  in  itself  such  a  perfect  nullity,  as \nnot  only  to  be  incapable  of  willing  good,  but  even \nof  knowing  how  much  evil  it  is  doing,  and  what \ngood  is.  Is  there  any  obscurity  in  any  word \nhere  ?  \"  They  know  not  what  they  do.\"  What \nis  there  remaining  in  Scripture,  which  may  not, \nby  the  suggestion  of  Diatribe,  prove  Freewill, \nwhen  this  most  clear  and  most  adversative  saying \nof  Christ  is  to  her  an  affirmation  of  it?  A  man \nmight  just  as  easily  say,  that  Freewill  is  proved \nby  that  saying,  \"  The  earth  was  empty v  and \nvoid;\"  or  by  that,  \"  God  rested  on  the  seventh \nday  :\"  and  the  like.  Then  will  the  Scriptures  be \nambiguous  and  obscure  indeed  !  nay,  they  will \nmean  all  things,  and  mean  nothing,  in  the  same \nmoment.  But  such  audacious  handling  of  the \nword  of  God  argues  a  mind  signally  contemptuous \nboth  towards  God  and  towards  man;  which  de- \nserves no  patience  at  all.x \n\nflying  off  from  the  proof  alleged,  in  pursuit  of  something  more \nremote ;  to  which  Luther  here  objects. \n\nv  Inanis.']  We  say,  '  without  form  ;'  but  Luther  has  it \nf  without  substance  •'  having  nothing  in  it,  or  upon  it. \n\nx  Luther  answers,  1.

See,  I  pray  you,  John \nis  not  speaking  of  any  work  of  man's,  whether \ngreat  or  small ;  but  of  the  actual  renewal  and \ntransmutation  of  the  old  man,  who  is  a  son  of \nthe  devil,  into  the  new  man;  who  is  a  son  of  God. \nThis  man  is  simply  passive  (as  they  speak),  and \ndoes  nothing,  but  is  altogether  a  thing  made.  For \nJohn  speaks  of  his  being  made  :  \"  to  be  made  the \nsons  of  God/'  he  says;  by  a  power  freely  given  to \nus  of  God,  not  by  a  power  of  Freewill  which  is \nnatural  to  us.z \n\nBut  oar  Diatribe  infers  from  hence,  that  Free- \nwill is  of  such  power,  as  to  make  sons  of  God; \nprepared  else  to  determine,  that  this  saying  of \nJohn  is  ridiculous  and  unmeaning.  But  who  has \never  extolled  Freewill  to  such  a  height,  as  to \ngive  it  the  power  of  making  sons  of  God ;  espe- \ncially such  a  Freewill,  as  can  will  nothing  good ; \nthe  one,  which  Diatribe  has  taken  up  to  prove.* \nBut  let  this  pass  with  the  rest  of  those  conse- \nquences, so  o.ten  repeated;  by  which,  if  any  thing \nis  proved,  it  is  nothing  else,  but  what  Diatribe \ndenies ;  namely,  that  Freewill  can  do  every  thing. \nWhat  John  means  is  this  :  that,  by  Christ's \ncoming  into  the  world,  a  power  is  given  to  all \nmen,  through  the  Gospel  (that  Gospel  by  which \ngrace  is  offered,  and  not  work  demanded),  which \n\ny  Malleus.']  More  properly.,  '  a  mallet)'  '  fab  rile  instrumen- \ntum  ad  tundendum.' \n\nz  Viinsitd.~]  Ins.  properly,  ' what  is  inserted  as  a  graft  {  but \ntransferred  to  signify  '  what  is  natural,  innate,  inherent.'

But  this  being  willing,  this  believing  in \nhis  name,  as  it  is  a  thing  which  Freewill  never \nknew,  never  thought  of  before ;  so  is  it  a  thing, \nwhich  she  is  yet  much  further  from  being  able  to \nattain  to,  by  her  own  powers.  For  how  should \nreason  imagine  that  faith  in  Jesus,  the  son  of  God \nand  of  man,  is  necessary ;  when  she  does  not \neven  at  this  day  comprehend,  nor  can  believe, \neven  though  the  whole  creation  should  as  with  an \naudible  voice  proclaim  it,  that  there  exists  a \nperson,  which  is  at  the  same  time  both  God  and \nman.  On  the  contrary,  she  is  the  more  offended \nby  such  preaching  ;  as  Paul  testifies  in  1  Cor.  i. \nso  far  is  she,  from  being  either  willing  or  able  to \nbelieve.b \n\nJohn,  therefore,  proclaims  those  riches  of  the \nkingdom  of  God  which  are  offered  to  the  world \nby  the  Gospel,  not  the  virtues  of  Freewill :  inti- \nmating at  the  same  time,  how  few  there  are  that \nreceive  them ;  because  Freewill,  forsooth,  resists \nthe  proposal,  her  power  being  nothing  else, \nthrough  the  dominion  which  Satan  has  over  her, \nbut  even   to  spurn   the   offer  of  grace,   and   of \n\nb  We  have  here  Luther's  usual,  exceptionable  expression \nabout  e  offers.'  (See  Sect.  xxiiL  note  a ) ;  and  his  mention  of \nthe  person  of  Christ  suggests  over  again  the  importance  of  the \ndistinction  which  I  remarked  in  Part  ii.  Sect.  viii.  note  r.  If  we  do \nnot  keep  the  divine  and  the  human  person  of  Christ  distinct,  but \nregard  him  simply  as  a  person  who  has  put  another  nature,  the \nhuman  nature,  upon  his  former  and  eternal,  divine  nature  ;  his \nwhole  history  and  the  things  said  of  him  are  a  Babel :  not  so, \nif  we  be  brought  to  apprehend  him  as  the  co-equal  of  the \nFather  and  of  the  Holy  Ghost  acting  in  and  by  a  human  person \nwhich  he  has  taken  up  into  union  with  himself. — The  text \nevidently  proves  nothing  for  Freewill :  it  only  says  \"  as  many \nas  received  him;\"  without  saying  by  what  power ;  whether \nnatural  or  supernatural.  I  do  not  agree  with  Luther,  in  its \nbeing  the  making  of  the  old  man  into  the  new  man  :  it  is  the \nstate  of  privilege  and  glory,  into  which  the  son  of  Adam  and \nchild  of  the  devil  has  been  brought,  by  that  preceding  process  of \ntransmutation. \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  231 \n\nthat  Spirit0  which  would  fulfil  the  law.     So  ex-  sc.xliii. \n\nquisite  is  the  force  of  her  desire  and  endeavour  to  \n\nfulfil  the  Jaw  ! — But,  hereafter,  I  shall  shew  more \nat  large,  what  a  thunderbolt  this  text  of  John's  is \nagainst  Freewill.  Meanwhile,  I  am  not  a  little \nindignant,  that  passages  so  clear  in  their  mean- \ning and  so  powerful  in  their  opposition  to  Freewill, \nshould  be  cited  by  Diatribe  in  her  favour  :  whose \ndulness  is  such,  that  she  discovers  no  difference \nbetween  law  wrords  and  words  of  promise;  for, \nhaving  first  of  all  established  Freewill,  most  ri- \ndiculously, by  lawr  testimonies,  she  afterwards \nreaches  the  highest  height  of  absurdity/  by  con- \nfirming it  with  words  of  promise.  This  absurdity, \nhowever,  is  easily  explained,  by  considering  with \nwhat  an  averse  and  contemptuous  mind  Diatribe \nengages  in  the  discussion.  To  her  it  is  no  matter, \nwhether  grace  stand  or  fall;  whether  Freewill  be \nlaid  prostrate  or  maintain  her  seat;  if  she  may  but \nprove  herself  the  humble  servant  of  a  conclave  of \ntyrants,  by  uttering  a  number  of  vain  wrords  to \nexcite  disgust  against  our  cause. \n\nAfter  this  we  come   to   Paul    also,   the   most  Objections \ndetermined   enemy   to   Freewill,   who    is    never-  fl'°™^f \ntheless  compelled  to  establish  Freewdll  by  what  dSpSch-7 \nhe    says    in  Rom.    ii.  \"  Or   despisest    thou    the  ed- \nriches    of  his   goodness   and  patience  and  long- \nsuffering  ?  or  knowest  thou  not  that  his  goodness \nleadeth   thee  to  repentance?\"     How  can  it  be, \nthat  contempt  of  the  commandment  is  imputed, \nwhere  the  will  is  not  free  ?

She  has  told  us,  in  her \napprovable  opinion,  that  Freewill  cannot  will \ngood,  and  compels  us  necessarily  into  the  service \nof  sin.  How  is  it  then,  that  contempt  of  the  com- \nmandment is  imputed  to  her;  if  she  cannot  will \ngood,  and  if  she  have  no  liberty,  but  be  under  a \nnecessary  bondage  to  sin?  How  is  it,  that  God \ninvites  to  repentance,  when  he  is  the  author  of \nman's  not  repenting ;  in  that  he  deserts,  or  does \nnot  confer  grace  upon  him,  when,  being  left  alone, \nhe  cannot  will  good  ?  How  is  it,  that  the  damna- \ntion is  just,  where  the  judge,  by  withdrawing  his \nhelp,  makes  it  unavoidable  that  the  ungodly  man \nbe  left  to  do  wickedly ■;  since,  by  his  own  power, \nhe  can  do  nothing  else  ? — All  these  sayings  recoil \nupon  the  head  of  Diatribe  :  or,  if  they  prove  any \nthing,  prove  (what  I  have  said)  that  Freewill  can \ndo  every  thing ;  in  contradiction  to  what  she  has \nsaid  herself,  and  every  body  else.  These  conse- \nquences of  reason  annoy  Diatribe,  throughout  all \nher  Scripture  quotations.  It  is  ridiculous  and \nunmeaning,  forsooth,  to  attack  and  exact/  in  such \nvehement  language,  when  there  is  not  one  present \nwho  can  fulfil  the  demand  ?  The  Apostle,  all  the \nwhile,  has  it  for  his  object  to  lead  ungodly  and \nproud  men  to  the  knowledge  of  themselves  and  of \ntheir  own  impotency,  by  the  means  of  these  threat- \nenings  ;  that,  having  humbled  them  by  the  know- \nledge of  sin,  he  may  prepare  them  for  grace.5 \n\ne  Referring,  no  doubt,  to  Rom.  iii.  5 —  8. \n\nf  Invadere  et  exigere.~]  Inv.  expresses  the  assault  upon  the \nperson:  '  in  aliquem  locum  vadoj'  ingredior  (et  fere  cum \naliquayi,  aut  impetu),  aggredior,  irrumpo,  irruo.

Christians,  however,  are  not  led  by \nFreewill,  but  by  the  Spirit  of  God.  (Rom.  viii.  14.) \nNow,  to  be  led  is  not  to  lead  ourselves,  but  to  be \ndriven  along,  just  as  the  saw  or  the  hatchet k  is \ndriven  along  by  the  carpenter.  And  here,  least \nany  one  should  doubt  Luther's  having  said  such \nabsurd  things,  Diatribe  recites  his  words  :  which  I \ndeliberately  own;  avowing,  as  I  do,1  that  WicklifPs \n\ntality  of  these  Scriptures.  Such  appeals  are  amongst  the  strong \nmanifesters  of  what  is  in  man  •  in  him  as  what  he  has  made \nhimself,  not  as  what  God  made  him  ;  in  him,,  therefore,  without \nexcuse.  By  such  manifesters,  God,  as  his  pleasure  is,  both \nhardeneth  and  converteth.  In  chap.  ii.  it  is  an  exposure  of  the \nheart  of  the  Jew  as  boasting  himself  against  the  heathen  ;  in \nchap  hi.  it  is  the  infidel  disporting  himself  against  the  truth  : \nwhose  damnation  is  shewn  to  be  just  by  the  language  which  he \nuses  ;  the  language  of  a  heart,  which  has  made  itself  vile. \n\nh  See  Sect,  xxxvi.  note  f  Gospel  precepts,  whether  from  the \nLord's  mouth,  or  Paul's  pen,  are  words  to  the  Lord's  called \nonly ;  shewing  how  the  saved  should  walk  :  that  we,  having  been \ndelivered  out  of  the  hands  of  our  enemies,  might  serve  him \nwithout  fear,  in  holiness  and  righteousness  before  him,  aU  the \ndays  of  our  life.

WicklifF,  with \nall  his  blemishes,  was  a  truly  great  man  j  enlightened  to  see \nand  teach  much  of  the  mystery  of  God  •  more,  I  am  ready  to \nsay,  than  many  that  came  after  him  and  carried  off  his  palm. \nMost  of  these  acknowledged  his  worth  indeed  :  for  more  than \na  century,  those  who  had  light  did  not  disdain  to  acknowledge \nthat  they  walked  in  his  light;  such  as  the  Lollards,  Huss, \nJerome,  and  others.  Erasmus  gives  him  to  Luther;  and \nLuther  is  not  ashamed  to  receive  and  confess  him.  Certainly, \nmy  friend  the  Dean  has  not  done  him  justice ;  yet  he  tried, \nI  admit,  and  meant  to  do  it  him.  But  this  necessity,  was  what \nthe  Dean  did  not  thoroughly  relish,  though  he  tolerated  it : \nand  so  he  apologized,  where  WicklifF  himself  would  have \ngloried ;  and  when  he  professes  to  give  a  brief  sketch  of  '  his \ndoctrines  as  extracted  from  his  writings  and  other  authentic \ndocuments,'  whilst  he  admits  that  c  his  distinguishing  tenet  was, \nundoubtedly,  the  election  of  grace,'  he  does  not  tell  us  what  he \nheld  about  it,  nor  even  mention  this  paradox,  which  seems  to \nhave  been  considered  as  the  centre  and  heart's  core  of  his \ncreed. — The  Dean  appears  to  have  attached  too  much  import^ \nance  to  Melancthon's  judgment,  who  was  so  warped  by  the  Sacra- \nmentarian  Controversy,  in  which  WicklifFs  name  was  drawn  out \nagainst  the  Lutherans,  that  he  went  to  a  great  extreme  in  deny- \ning WicklifFs  light;  declaring  t  that  he  had  found  in  him,  also, \nmany  other  errors'  (beside  this  on  the  sacrament),  '  and  that \nhe  neither  understood  nor  believed  the  righteousness  of  faith.' — \nI  admit  that  he  had  much  darkness  mingled  with  his  light  • \nconfusion  with  his  clearness  ;  pusillanimity  with  his  boldness  ; \nsophistry  with  his  plainness  ;  rashness  with  his  honest  zeal  for \nreform.  But  I  am  rather  inclined  to  measure  a  man  by  what \nhe  has  of  good,  than  by  what  he  has  also  of  evil ;  and  when  I \nsee  WickHff  acknowledged  as  the  first  open  champion  and \n\n\nTEXTS  FOR  FREEWILL  DISPROVED.  235 \n\nwas  falsely  condemned  by  the  Council  of  Con-  sc.xliv. \n\nstance  ; n   or  rather  by  conspiracy  and  sedition.  — m \n\nNay,  even  Diatribe  herself  defends  him,  in  con- \njunction with  me;  asserting,  as  she  does,  that \nFreewill  can  will  nothing  good  by  its  own  powers, \nand  serves  sin  necessarily ;  though,  in  the  course \nof  her  proof,  she  establishes  the  direct  contrary. \n\ndeclarer  against  the  abominations  of  Antichrist ;  when  I  read \nsuch  profound  and  luminous  testimonies  to  the  ' '  hidden  wis- \ndom \"  in  his  writings  j  when  I  hear  martyrs  calling  him  their \napostle,  and  a  Cobham  '  solemnly  professing  before  God  and  man \nthat  he  never  abstained  from  sin  till  he  knew  Wickliff — but  that \nafter  he  became  acquainted  with  that  virtuous  man  and  his  de- \nspised doctrines  it  had  been  otherwise  with  him  j'  when  I  recollect, \nthat  he  was  the  first  who  gave  the  Bible  to  our  nation  in  English, \nand  vindicated  the  right  of  the  common  people  to  read  it ; \nwhen  I  find  the  more  determined  of  the  reformers  of  the  six- \nteenth century  owning  him  as  their  forerunner,  and  their \nrevilers  casting  him  in  their  teeth  :  I  am  ashamed  to  ask  what \ndoctrine  he  held  about  tithes  -,  to  doubt  his  sincerity,  because \nhis  circumstances  drew  him  into  an  undesirable  degree  of  mix- \nture with  carnal  statesmen ;  to  weigh  the  words  which  he \ndropped,  in  the  hour  of  the  power  of  darkness,  in  a  pair  of \nscales ;  and  to  ( rejoice  in  finding  evidence,'  as  the  result  of \nmuch  pious  search,  '  that  this  celebrated  champion  did  belong \nto  the  church  of  Christ.'

You  will  see  here  what  a  man-raised \nsmoke  is,  when  opposed  to  God's  thunders  and \nlightnings  ! \n\nFirst  then,  after  having  recited  innumerable \ntexts  of  Scripture  in  support  of  Freewill,  as  a \nsort  of  army  too  dreadful  to  encounter  (that  she \nmay  give  courage  to  the  confessors  and  martyrs, \nand  all  the  holy  men  and  women  who  staud  up \nfor  Freewill ;  and  may  inspire  fear  and  trembling \ninto  all  who  are  guilty  of  the  sin  of  denying  it)  ; \nshe  pretends  that  the  host  which  comes  to  oppose \nFreewill  is  contemptible  in  point  of  numbers,  and \ngoes  on  to  represent  that  there  are  but  two  pas- \nsages which  stand  conspicuous  above  the  rest  on \nthis  side  of  the  argument :  having  nothing  in  her \nmind,  as  it  should  seem,  but  slaughter,  and  making \nsure  of  accomplishing  it  without  much  trouble. \nOne  of  these  is  from  Exod.  ix.  cc  The  Lord  har- \ndened Pharaoh's  heart:\"  the  other  is  from  Ma- \nlachi  i.  «  Jacob  have  I  loved,  but  Esau  have  I \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  237 \n\nhated.\"  Strange,  what  an  odious  and  unprofitable  sect.  ii. \n\ndiscussion  Paul  did  take  up,  in  the  judgment  of \n\nDiatribe,  when  he  expounded  both  these  at  large \nto  the  Romans  !  In  short,  if  the  Holy  Ghost \nwere  not  a  little  knowing  in  rhetoric,  there  would \nbe  danger  lest  his  heart  should  melt  within  him, \nthrough  this  great  reach  of  art  in  pretending  such \nvast  contempt ;  and,  lest  absolutely  despairing  of \nhis  cause,  he  should  yield  the  palm  to  Freewill, \nbefore  the  trumpet  has  called  the  champions  into \nthe  lists.  Presently,  however,  I  shall  come  up \nas  the  reserve a  to  these  two  Scriptures,  and  shew \nmy  forces  also  :  and  yet,  where  such  is  the  fortune \nof  the  battle,  that  one  man  puts  ten  thousand  to \nflight,  what  need  is  there  of  forces  ?  If  one  text \nof  Scripture  shall  have  conquered  Freewill,  her \ninnumerable  forces  will  be  of  no  use  to  her. \n\nHere  therefore  Diatribe  has  discovered  a  new  Kills  by- \nmethod  of  eluding  the  plainest  texts,  by  choosing  iesolvjng \nto  understand  a  trope  in  the  simplest  and  clearest  tropes? \nforms  of  speech.

But \nLuther  well  knew  the  God  of  battles  ;  nor  meant  to  ascribe \ntheir  issue  to  any  other  than  Him  ;  \"  even  the  Lord  strong \nand  mighty,  the  Lord  mighty  in  battle  !\" \n\nb  Elusit.~\\  It  was  evading  the  natural  and  legitimate  inter- \npretation of  those  words,  when  she  practised  with  them  so  as  to \npass  them  off  for  assertives. \n\ncAdjectas.  affictas]  Adj.

Whilst  strangely \ndefective  in  his  perceptions  of  divine  truth,  he  was  learned, \nupright,  disinterested,  and  laborious  :  a  man  of  conscience  and \nof  magnanimity.  Philosophy  and  literature  were  his  bane.  He \ndid  much  mischief  to  the  church  by  his  style  of  interpreting \nScripture,  not  only  in  rendering  human  fancies  for  a  season \nfashionable,  to  the  exclusion  of  plain  truth ;  but,  as  a  remote \nconsequence,  by  bringing  even  the  sober  use  of  types  and \nfigures — that  pregnant  source  of  lively  and  particularizing \ninstruction — into  the  contempt  with  which  it  has  now  for  some \nages  been  loaded. — Two  sentences  of  his  are  worthy  to  be  pre- \nserved. On  the  words,  ' f We  conclude  that  a  man  is  justified \nby  faith\"  (Rom.  iii.)  he  says,  e  The  justification  of  faith  only, \nis  sufficient ;  so  that,  if  any  person  only  believe,  he  may  be \njustified,  though  no  good  work  hath  been  fulfilled  by  him.'  On \nthe  case  of  the  penitent  thief,  he  writes,  '  He  was  justified  by \nfaith,  without  the  works  of  the  law  j  because,  concerning \nthese,  the  Lord  did  not  inquire  what  he  had  done  before  j \nneither  did  he  stay  to  ask  what  work  he  was  purposing  to  per- \nform after  he  had  believed; — but,  the  man  being  justified  by  his \nconfession  only,  Jesus  who  was  going  to  Paradise,  took  him  as \na  companion  and  carried  him  there.' — His  Hexapla  furnished \nthe  first  specimen  of  a  Polyglot. \n\n°  Porphyry,  a  Platonic  philosopher,  who  lived  in  the  same \ncentury  with  Origen,  made  great  use  of  his  fanciful  interpreta- \ntions, in  reviling  Christianity.  From  the  serious  pains  taken  by \nthe  ancient  Christians  to  confute  him,  it  may  be  presumed  that \nhis  works  (which  are  now  chiefly  lost)  were  subtle  and  inge- \nnious ;  but  his  testimony,  like  that  of  most  other  infidels,  has \nbeen  made  to  redound  to  the  establishment,  instead  of  the \nsubversion,  of  the  Gospel.  (See  Chap.  xxi.  Cent.  iii.  of  Milner's \nEcc.  Hist,  where  a  remarkable  assemblage  of  testimonies  to \nthis  conclusion  is  skilfully  adduced  :  and  see,  especially,  vol.  ii. \nof  Fry's  Second  Advent,  where  Gibbon  is  made  the  same  sort \nof  unintentional  witness.) — Porphyry  censures  Origen  for \nc  leaving  Gentilism,  and  embracing  the  barbarian  temerity :' \nwhereas  Origen  was,  in  fact,  brought  up  under  christian \nparents,  and  a  man  of  christian  habits  from  his  youth.

What  has  come  to   sec.  hi. \n\nthe  Avians,  through  that  trope  of  theirs,  by  which  \n\nthey  make  Christ  a  mere  nuncupative  God?q \nWhat  has  come  to  these  new  prophets  in  our  day, \nwho,  in  expounding  Christ's  words,  (  This  is  my \nbody/  find  a  trope,  one  of  them  in  the  pronoun \n'this;'  another  in  the  verb  'is;'  a  third  in  the \nnoun  'body?'1     It  is  the  result  of  my  observa- \n\nhis  introduction  of  it  into  the  Scriptures ;  which,  as  this  enemy \njustly  teaches,  abhor  such  an  associate. \n\np  Jerome,  the  renowned  monk  of  Stridon,  in  Pannonia, \nhad  a  good  deal  of  the  spirit  of  Origen.  Luther  says, \neven  Jerome  :  a  man  of  prodigious  learning,  lively  eloquence, \nand  vigorous  mind,  but  of  small  discernment  in  the  truth} \none  taught  of  man,  more  than  of  God.  He  was  born  under \nConstantine,  a.  d.  331,  the  contemporary  of  Augustine,  and  his \nopponent ;  ever,  and  all  his  days,  a  controversialist :  peevish \nand  vain;  self-righteous  and  superstitious;  but  sincere  and \ndevout. — To  him  the  Romish  church  owes  her  Vulgate.  '  In \nhis  very  voluminous  expositions,  he  speaks  at  random  :  is  alle- \ngorical beyond  all  bounds,  and  almost  always  without  accuracy \nand  precision  ;  lowers  the  doctrine  of  illumination  in  1  Cor.  ii. \nto  things  moral  and  practical;  hints  at  something  like  a  first \nand  second  justification  before  God ;  asserts  predestination,  and \nas  it  were  retracts  it;  owns  a  good  will  as  from  God  in  one \nplace,  in  another  supposes  a  power  to  choose  to  be  the  whole  of \ndivine  grace  ;  never  opposes  fundamental  truths  deliberately, \nbut  though  he  owns  them  every  where,  always  does  so  defec- \ntively, and  often  inconsistently.  It  must  be  confessed,  the \nreputation  of  this  Father's  knowledge  and  abilities  has  been \nmuch  overrated.  There  is  a  splendour  in  a  profusion  of  ill- \ndigested  learning,  coloured  by  a  lively  imagination,  which  is \noften  mistaken  for  sublimity  of  genius.  This  was  Jerome's \ncase ;  but  this  was  not  the  greatest  part  of  the  evil.

If  you  have  not \nshewn  me,  that  there  must  necessarily  be  a  trope \nhere ;  you  have  done  nothing.

The  question  is,  whether  it  would  be \nsafe  for  him  to  use  it,  and  certain  that  he  used  it \nrightly,  in  this  place  ;  and  whether  Paul  meant  to \nuse  it.

Upon  this  principle,  a  man  has  but  to \nopen  the  book  of  God,  and  by  and  by  he  is  a \ntheologian.b  Let  it  be  a  settled  and  fixed  prin- \nciple then,  that,  when  Diatribe  cannot  prove  that \nthere  is  a  trope  in  these  passages  of  ours  which \nshe  is  refuting,0  she  be  obliged  to  concede  to \nus,  that  the  words  must  be  understood  according \nto  their  literal  import;  even  though  she  should \nprove  that  the  same  trope  is  of  most  frequent  use \nelsewhere,  both  in  all  parts  of  Scripture  and  in \ncommon  discourse.  If  this  principle  be  admitted, \nall  our  testimonies  which  Diatribe  meant  to  con- \nfute, have  been  defended  at  once ;  and  her  con- \nfutation is  found  to  have  effected  absolutely  no- \nthing, to  have  no  power,  to  be  a  mere  nothing. \n\nWhen  she  interprets  that  saying  of  Moses, \ntherefore,  u  I  will  harden  Pharaoh's  heart,\"  to \nmean  f  My  lenity  in  bearing  with  a  sinner,  leads \nothers,  it  is  true,  to  repentance,  but  it  shall  render \nPharaoh  more  obstinate  in  his  wickedness ;'  this \nis  a  pretty  saying,  but  there  is  no  proof  that  she \n\na  Anaxagoras,  a  philosopher  of  Clazomenae,  the  preceptor  of \nSocrates,  amongst  many  other  paradoxes,  is  said  to  have  insisted \nthat  '  snow  was  black,  because  made  of  water.' \n\nb  Quis  non.  .  .  .

On  the  other  hand,  when \nhe  brought  them  back  and  gave  them  deliverance, \nhe  did  not  pity  but  harden  them ;  that  is,  by  his \nlenity  and  pity,  he  gave  occasion  to  their  being \nhardened.  Thus,  the  sending  of  Christ  the  Sa- \nviour into  the  world,  shall  not  be  called  an  act  of \nmercy  in  God,  but  an  act  of  hardening;  since  by \nthis  mercy  he  hath  given  men  occasion  to  harden \nthemselves.  On  the  other  hand,  in  having  laid \nJerusalem  waste,  and  destroyed0  the  Jews  unto \nthis  very  day,  he  shows  mercy  towards  them ; \ninasmuch  as  he  chastises  them  for  their  sin,  and \ninvites  them  to  repentance.  In  carrying  his  saints \nto  heaven  at  the  day  of  judgment,  he  will  not \nperform  an  act  of  mercy  but  of  induration :  inas- \nmuch as  he  will  give  them  an  opportunity  of \nabusing  his  goodness.  In  thrusting  the  wicked \ninto  hell;  herein,  he  will  shew  mercy,  because  it \nwill  be  chastising  the  sinner.  Who  ever  heard, \npray,  of  such  compassions  and  such  wraths  of  God \nas  these  ? \n\nWhat,  if  good  men  are  made  better  by  the  for- \n\nc  PerdiditJ]  c  AttoWvw,  airofiaXhw,  destruo,  everto,  deperdo. \nSi  vocem  spectes,  est  a  per  et  do  ;  si  notionem,  a  7rep6(v,  vasto, \nesse  videtur.'

First,  man  does  nevertheless  necessa- \nsarily  serve  sin.  For,  when  it  has  been  granted \nthat  Freewill  can  not  will  any  thing  good  (and \nsuch  a  sort  of  Freewill  is  what  Diatribe  has  under- \ntaken to  prove),  it  is  made  no  better  by  the  for- \nbearance of  a  long-suifering  God,  but  is  necessarily \nmade  worse ;  unless  through  the  mercy  of  God, \nthe  Spirit  be  added  to  it.  So  that  all  things  still \nhappen  by  necessity;  as  it  respects  us. \n\nSecondly,  God  seems  to  be  as  cruel  in  bearing \nwith  men  out  of  lenity,  as  he  is  thought  to  be \nthrough  our  representation;  who  say,  that  he \nhardens  in  the  exercise  of  that  inscrutable  will  of \nhis.m  For,  since  he  sees  that  Freewill  can  will \nnothing  good,  and  is  made  worse  by  his  lenity  in \nbearing  with  us,  this  very  lenity  exhibits  him  in \nthe  most  cruel  form,  as  one  that  is  delighted  with \nour  calamities  :  seeing  he  could  heal  them,  if  he \nwould ;  and  could  avoid  bearing  with  us  if  he \nwould;  or  rather,  could  not  bear  with  us,  except  it \nwere  his  will  to  do  so  :  for  who  could  compel  him \nto  do  so,  against  his  will  ?  If  that  will  therefore \nremains,  without  which  nothing  happens  in  the \nworld;  and  it  be  granted,  that  Freewill  can \nwill  nothing  good;  all  that  is  said  to  excuse \nGod,  and  to  accuse  Freewill,  is  said  to  no  pur- \npose. For  Freewill  is  always  saying,  e  I  cannot, \nand  God  will  not :  what  can  I  do  ?  Let  him  shew \nme  mercy,  forsooth,  by  afflicting  me ;  I  am  never \nthe  forwarder  for  it,  but  must  be  made  worse ; \nexcept  he  give  me  the  Spirit.  This  he  does  not \ngive ;  which  he  would  give,  if  it  were  his  will  to \ndo  so :  it  is  certain  therefore,  that  he  wills  not \nto  give  it/n \n\nm  Volendo  voluntate  Hid  imperscrutabili.~]  See  above,  Part  iii. \nSect,  xxviii.  notes  l  v  x. \n\nn  Luther's  drift  is,  '  There  must  be  a  will  of  God  distinct \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  253 \n\nNor  are  the  similes,  which  she  adduces,  at  all  sec.viii. \nto  the  purpose,  when  she  says,  c  As  mud  is  hard-  \"~    7~7~ \nened  by  the  self-same  sun  which  melts  wax  ;  and,  ^iies  of \nas  the  cultivated  ground  produces  fruit  by  means  sun  and \nof  the  self-same  shower  from  which  the  untilled  ™j.\"eJe\" \nsends  forth  thorns ;    even   so,    by  the  self-same \nforbearance   of    God,     some   are   hardened   and \nothers  converted/ \n\nWe  do  not  divide  Freewill  into  two  different \nsorts,  making  one  to  be  mud  and  the  other  wax  ; \nor  one  to  be  cultivated  ground,  and  the  other \nneglected  ground  :  but  we  speak  of  one  sort  of \nFreewill,  which  is  equally  impotent  in  all  men  ; \nwhich  is  nothing  else  but  the  mud,  nothing  else  but \nthe  untilled  ground,  in  these  comparisons — seeing \nit  is  what  cannot  will  good.  Nor  does  Paul  say \nthat  God,  in  his  character  of  the  potter,  makes \none  vessel  to  honour  and  another  to  dishonour, \nout  of  a  different  lump  of  clay;  but  \"  of  the  same \nlump,  saith  he,  the  potter  maketh,  &c.\"  So \nthat,  as  the  mud  always  becomes  harder,  and  the \nuncultivated  ground  more  thorny,  by  the  sun \nand  rain,  severally ;  even  so,  Freewill  is  always \nmade  worse,  as  well  by  the  indurating  mildness \nof  the  sun  as  by  the  liquefying  violence  of  the \nrain.°  If  the  definition  of  Freewill  then  be  one, \nand  its  impotency  the  same  in  all  men ;  no  reason \ncan  be  assigned,  why  one  man's  Freewill  attains \nto  grace,  and  another  man's  does  not ;  if  no  other \ncause  be  declared  than  the  forbearance  of  an \nenduring  God  and  the  correction  of  a  pitying  one  : \nfor  it  is  assumed,  by  a  definition  which  makes  no \ndistinctions,  that  Freewill  in  every  man  is  a \npower  which  can  will  nothing  good.

(Hor.  1.  Sat.  v.  101.) \nIt  is  said  in  excuse  for  the  less  explicit  parts  of  his  system,  that \n'  he  attached  himself  to  the  principles  of  natural  philosophy, \nrather  than  those  of  theology.'  He  maintained  the  existence \nof  a  God  as  the  great  mover  of  all  things ;  which  have  been \nput  into  motion  from  eternity,  and  will  continue  in  motion  to \neternity.  Thus  he  maintained  the  eternity  of  matter  as  well \nas  of  God,  He  painted  this  God  finely  :  '  the  necessary  being;' \nf  the  first,  and  the  most  excellent  of  beings;'  '  immutable,  in- \ntelligent, indivisible,  without  extension:'  *  He  resides  above \nthe  enclosure  of  the  world/  '  He  there  finds  his  happiness  in \nthe  contemplation  of  himself.' — How  apt  is  the  expression,  by \nwhich  Luther  describes  him  as  painting  God  !  (pinxit)  a  rhe- \ntorical term  applied  to  that  sort  of  discourse  '  which  is  embel- \nlished with  tropes  and  figures,  such  as  display  much  genius,  but \ncharm  by  their  sweetness.,  rather  than  edify  by  their  intelligence,' \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  255 \n\none  who  sleeps,  for  example,  and  suffers  any  that  sec.viil \n\nwill,   to   use  and  to  abuse  his  goodness  and  his  \n\nseverity.5  And  how  can  reason  judge  otherwise \nof  God,  than  Diatribe  here  does  ?  For,  as  she \nherself  snores  away,   and  despises  divine  things; \n\nAristotle's  God,  then,  is  one  who  keeps  order  in  the  heavens, \nbut  interferes  in  a  very  limited  degree  with  earth.  '  All  the \nmovements  of  nature  are  in  some  sort  subordinated  to  him ;  He \nappears  to  be  the  cause  and  principle  of  every  thing;  He \nappears  to  take  some  care  of  human  affairs.  But,  in  all  the \nuniverse,  He  can  look  upon  nothing  but  Himself;  the  sight \nof  crime  and  of  disorder  would  defile  his  eyes  :  He  could  not \nknow  how  to  be  the  author  either  of  the  prosperity  of  the \nwicked,  or  of  the  misery  of  the  good.  His  superintendence  is \nlike  that  of  the  master  of  a  family,  who  has  established  a  cer- \ntain order  of  things  in  his  household,  and  takes  care  that  the \nend  which  he  has  in  view  be  accomplished,  but  shuts  his  eyes \nto  their  divisions  and  their  vices,  and  only  takes  care  to  obviate \nthe  consequences  of  them.  He  stamped  the  impress  of  his \nwill  upon  the  universe,  when  first  he  projected  it  like  a  ball \nfrom  his  hand  ;  and  it  is  by  a  general,  not  minute,  superintend- \nence, that  he  sustains  it.  The  perpetuation  of  the  several \nspecies  of  beings  is  his  grand  object :  which  he  secured  by  his \none  first  impulse.'* — Has  Luther  calumniated  this  philosopher? \nYet  was  this  heathen  teacher  made  the  great  model  for  instruc- \ntion to  the  christian  church,  both  as  to  form  and  substance,  for \nmany  ages.

The  predominance  of \nhis  philosophy — c  a  philosophy,  which  knew  nothing  of  original \nsin  and  native  depravity  ;  which  allowed  nothing  to  be  crimi- \nnal, but  certain  external  flagitious  actions  5  and  which  was \nunacquainted  with  any  righteousness  of  grace,  imputed  to  a \nsinner' — was  itself  a  corruption,  and  the  fruitful  source  of  other \ncorruptions,  which  cried  aloud  for  reformation,  and  which  the \nreformers  of  the  sixteenth  century  exposed  and  suppressed. \n(See  Aliln.

We  forget  our  own- \nselves  also  the  mean  while,  and  chatter,  like  mad \npeople,  both  against  God  and  against  ourselves, \nin  the  same  breath;  though  our  design  is  to  speak \nwith  great  wisdom,  both  for  God  and  for  our- \nselves. You  see  here,  in  the  first  place,  what \nthis  trope  and  gloss  of  Diatribe's  makes  of  God  : \nbut  do  you  not  also  see,  how  vastly  consistent  she \nis  with  herself  in  it  ?  She  had  before  made  Free- \nwill equal  and  alike  in  all,  by  including  all  in  one \ndefinition;  but  now,  in  the  course  of  her  dispu- \ntation, she  forgets  her  own  definition,  and  makes \na  cultivated  Freewill  one,  and  an  uncultivated \nFreewill  another;  setting  out  a  diversity  of  Free- \nwills,  according  to  the  diversity  of  works,  habits, \nand  characters;  one  that  can  do  good,  another \nthat  cannot  do  good  :  and  this,  by  its  own  powers, \nbefore  grace  received;  by  which  powers  of  its \nown,  she  had  laid  it  down  in  her  definition,  that \nFreewill  could  not  of  itself  will  any  thing  good. \nThus  it  comes  to  pass,  that,  if  we  will  not  leave \nto  the  sole  will  of  God  both  the  will  and  the  power \nto  harden,  and  to  shew  mercy,  and  to  do  every \nthing;  we  must  ascribe  to  Freewill  herself  the \npower  of  doing  every  thing,  without  grace  :  al- \nthough we  have  denied  that  it  can  do  any  thing \ngood  without  grace. \n\n*  Sap.  vol.  pmsentid  elig.  discern,  inspir,  omissd. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  257 \n\nThe  simile  of  the  sun  and  rain,  then,  is  of  no  sec.ix.; \nforce  as  to  this  point.

The \nformer  of  these  are  edified  and  made  better  by \nthe  word;  the  latter  are  oifended  and  made \nworse:  whereas  Freewill,  when  left  to  herself, \nis  in  all  men  the  uncultivated  ground;  yea,  the \nkingdom  of  Satan. \n\nLet  us  also  look  into  her  reasons  for  imagining  Erasmus's \nthis  trope  in  this  place.     It  seems  absurd,  says  J^troT* \nDiatribe,  that  God,  who  is  not  only  just  but  also  dzingcon- \ngood,  should  be  said  to  have  hardened  a  man's  aideied» \nheart  in  order  to  manifest  his  own  power  by  the \nman's  wickedness.     So  she  runs  back  to  Origen ; \nwho  confesses,  that  God  gave  occasion  to  the  in- \nduration, but  flings  back  the  blame  upon  Pharaoh. \nOrigen   has,    besides,    remarked   that  the   Lord \nsaid,  ic  For  this  cause  have  I  raised  thee  up  :\"  He \ndoes  not  say,  '  for  this  cause  have  I  made  thee.9 \nNo :  for  Pharaoh  would  not  have  been   wicked, \nif  he  had  been  such  as  God  made  him ;  God  hav- \ning beheld  all  his  works,  and  they  were  very  good. \nSo  much  for  Diatribe. \n\nAbsurdity,  then,  is  one  of  the  principal  reasons  Absurdity \nfor  not  understanding  Moses's  and  Paul's  words  £°.tasut- \nin  their  simple  and  literal  sense.     But  what  ar-  son. \ntide  of  faith  is  violated  by  this  absurdity,  and \nwho  is  offended  by  it  ?      Human  reason  is  of- \nfended:    and   she   forsooth,    who  is   blind,  deaf, \nfoolish,  impious  and  sacrilegious  in  her  dealings \nwith  all  the  words  and  works  of  God,  is  brought \nin  here  to  be  the  judge  of  God's  works  and  words. \nUpon  the  same  principle,  you  will  deny  all  the \narticles  of  the  christian  faith ;  inasmuch  as  it  is \nthe  most  absurd  thing  possible,    and,    as  Paul \nsays,    \"  to    the    Jews    a    stumbling   block,    and \nto  the  Gentiles   foolishness,\"    that   God    should \n\n\n258  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  IV.  become  man,  the  son  of  a  virgin ;  that  he  should \n11  have  been  crucified ;  that  he  should  be  sitting  at \nthe  right  hand  of  the  Father.  It  is  absurd,  I  say, \nto  believe  such  things.  Let  as  therefore  invent  some \ntropes  like  those  of  the  Arians,  to  prevent  Christ \nfrom  being  God  absolutely?  Let  us  invent  some \ntropes  like  those  of  the  Manicheans/  to  prevent \n\nu  Simpliciter,  opposed  to  Jig uratiuehj.     See  Sect.  iii.  note  9. \nv  The  Manichees,  so  called  from  Manes  their  founder,  arose \nin  the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Probus,  a.  d.  277-     '  Like  most  of \nthe  ancient  heretics,  they  abounded  in  senseless   whims,  not \nworthy  of  any  solicitous  explanation.     This  they  had  in  com- \nmon with  the  Pagan   philosophers,    that   they   supposed   the \nSupreme  Being  to  be  material,  and  to  penetrate  all  nature. \nTheir  grand  peculiarity  was  to  admit  of  two  independent  prin- \nciples, a  good  and  an  evil  one,  in  order  to  solve  the  arduous \nquestion  concerning  the  origin  of  evil.     Like  all  heretics,  they \nmade  a  great  parade  of  seeking  truth  with  liberal  impartiality, \nand  were  thus  qualified  to  deceive  unwary  spirits,  who,   far \nfrom  suspecting  their  own  imbecility  of  judgment,    and   re- \ngardless of  the  word  of  God  and  hearty  prayer,  have  no  idea  of \nattaining  religious  knowledge  by   any  other  method  than  by \nnatural  reason.'     '  Like  air  other  heretics  they  could  not  stand \nbefore  the    Scriptures.      They   professedly   rejected   the    Old \nTestament,  as  belonging  to  the  malignant  principle  ;  and,  when \nthey  were  pressed  with  the  authority  of  the  New,  as  corrobo- \nrating the   Old,  they  pretended  the  New  was  adulterated. — \nIs  there  any  new  thing  under  the  sun  ?     Did  not  Lord  Boling- \nbroke  set  up  the  authority  of  St.  John  against  St.  Paul  ?     Have \nwe  not  heard  of  some  parts  of  the  Gospel  as  not  genuine,  be- \ncause they  suit  not  Socinian  views  ?     Genuine  christian  prin- \nciples alone  will  bear  the  test,   nor  fear  the  scrutiny  of  the \nwhole  word  of  God.' — Augustine,  who  lived  about  a  century \nafter  they  had  first  arisen,  describes  them  to  the  life ;  after \nhaving  himself  smarted  under   the    poison    of    their   arrows, \nfor  about  twelve  years  :   seduced  partly  by  their  subtile  and \ncaptious    questions   concerning  the    origin  of  evil,    partly  by \ntheir    blasphemies      against      the     Old    Testament    saints. — \nWith  respect  to  the  person  of  Christ,  their  heresy  was  like \nthat  of  the  Gnostics,  or  Docetae  :    worthy  children  of  Simon \nMagus  !     They  held  that  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  had  no  proper \nhumanity ;  the  mere   phantasm    of  a   man  having  glided,   as \nLuther  here  describes  it,  through  the  virgin's  womb,  and  after- \nwards  expired  upon  the  cross. — '  Yet  though  my  ideas  were \nmaterial,  says   Augustine,  I  could  not  bear  to   think  of  God \nbeing  flesh.     That  was  too  gross  and  low  in  my  apprehensions. \nThy  only  begotten  son  appeared  to  me  as  the  most  lucid  part \nof  thee,  afforded  for  our  salvation.     I  concluded  that  such  a \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  259 \n\nhis  being  a  real  man  ;  and  let  us  make  him  out  to  SECT.ix. \n\nbe  a  sort  of  phantom,  which  glided  through  the  \n\nvirgin  (like  a  ray  of  the  sun  through  a  piece  of \nglass),  and  was  crucified.  A  nice  way  of  handling \nScripture  ! \n\nAnd  yet  these  tropes  get  us  no  forwarder,  and  Does  not \ndo  not  serve  to  evade  the  absurdity :  for  it  still  SSSSJj?\" \nremains  absurd  in  the  eye  of  reason  that  this  just \nand  good  God  should  demand  impossibilities  of \nFreewill ;  and  when  Freewill  cannot  will  good, \nbut  by  necessity  serves  sin,  should  nevertheless \nimpute  it  to  her ;  and  so  long  as  he  withholds  the \nSpirit,  should  not  be  a  whit  more  kind,  or  more \nmerciful,  than  if  he  were  to  harden  or  permit  men \nto  be  hardened.  Reason  will  be  again  and  again \nrepeating,  that  these  are  not  the  acts  of  a  kind \nand  merciful  God.  These  things  so  far  exceed \nher  apprehension,  and  she  so  wants  power  to  take \neven  her  own  self  captive,  that  she  cannot  believe \nGod  to  be  good  if  he  should  act  and  judge  so; \nbut  setting  faith  aside,  demands  that  she  should \nbe  able  to  touch  and  see  and  comprehend  how \nit  is  that  He  is  just  and  not  cruel.  Now  she \nwould  have  this  sort  of  comprehension  if  it  were \nsaid  of  God,  c  he  hardens  nobody,  he  damns \nnobody ;  on  the  contrary,  he  pities  every  body, \nhe  saves  everybody/  so  as  that  hell  should  be \ndestroyed,  and  the  fear  of  death  removed,  and  no \nfuture  punishment  dreaded.  Hence  it  is,  that  she \nbecomes  so  boisterous  and  so  vehement x  in  ex- \nnature  could  not  be  born  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  without  par- \ntaking of  human  flesh,  which  I  thought  must  pollute  it. \nHence  arose  my  fantastic  ideas  of  Jesus,  so  destructive  of  all \npiety.  Thy  spiritual  children  may  smile  at  me  with  charitable \nsympathy,  if  they  read  these  my  confessions ;  such  however \nwere  my  views.' — Milner  in  Augustine's  Confessions,  Eccles. \nHist.  vol.  ii.  pp.  314—327. \n\nx  Mstuat  et  contendit.']  Mst.  denoting  violent  heat  in  gene- \nral, is  especially  applied  to  the  boiling  and  swelling  of  the  sea, \nwhen  it  ebbs  and  flows,  or  rises  in  surges  and  waves.

And  of  what  use  is  it,  that  we \nare  wearied  to  death  with  these  elaborate  specu- \nlations that  we  may  be  enabled  to  remove  the \nblame  of  induration  from  God  to  Freewill. \nLet  Freewill  do  what  she  can,  with  all  her \nmeans y  and  all  her  might  in  exercise,  she  will \nnever  furnish  an  example  of  avoiding  to  be  har- \ndened where  God  has  not  given  his  Spirit,  or  of \nearning  mercy  where  she  has  been  left  to  her \nown  powers.  For,  what  is  the  difference  whether \nshe  be  hardened  or  deserve  to  be  hardened ;  since \nhardening  is  necessarily  in  her,  so  long  as  that \nimpotency,  by  which,  according  to  Diatribe  her- \nself, she  cannot  will  good,  is  in  her.  Since  the \nabsurdity  then  is  not  removed  by  these  tropes,  or,  if \nremoved,  is  removed  but  to  make  way  for  greater \nabsurdities,  and  to  ascribe  all  power  to  Freewill ; \naway  with  these  useless  and  misleading  tropes, \nand  let  us  stick  to  the  pure  and  simple  word  of \nGod. \nsect.  x.       <  The  other   principal   reason   why   this  trope \n\nshould  be  received  is,  that  the  things  which  God \n\nratde  aiT*    W&h  made  are  very  good :   and  God   does   not \n\nthings  very  say,  I  have  made  thee  for  this  very  thing,  but  for \n\ngood  not  a  this  very  thing  I  have  raised  thee  up/ \n\nreason.  First  I  answer,  that  this  was  said  before  the \n\nfall   of  man,   when  the   things   which    God   had \n\nmade  were  very  good.     But  it  follows  presently, \n\nin  the  third  chapter,  how  man  was  made  evil, \n\ndeserted  of  God  and  left  to  himself.     From  this \n\nman,  so  corrupted,  all  men  are  born,  and  born \n\ny  Toto  mundo  totisque  viribus.~\\  Mundus  is  properly  e  the \nstuff  of  the  world' — the  materials  of  which  it  is  constituted — \nand  is  transferred  ihence  to  all  kinds  of  furniture  and  provi- \nsion— specially  to  '  women's  dress  and  ornaments:'  '  instru- \nmentum  ornatus  muliebris.'  I  would  not  be  sure  that  Luther \nhas  not  some  allusion  to  '  Madam  Diatribe's '  adornments \nhere. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  261 \n\nwicked ;    Pharoah   amongst   the   rest.     As   Paul  SECT.  X. \n\nsays,  \"  We  were  all  by  nature  the  children  of \n\nwrath,  even  as  others.\"  God  therefore  did  make \nPharaoh  wicked ;  that  is,  out  of  a  wicked  and \ncorrupted  seed.  As  he  says  in  the  Proverbs  of \nSolomon,  \"  The  Lord  hath  made  all  things  for \nhimself,  yea,  even  the  wicked  man  for  the  day  of \nevil\"  (not  indeed  by  creating  wickedness  in  him, \nbut  by  forming  him  out  of  an  evil  seed  and \nruling  him.)  It  is  not  a  just  conclusion  there- \nfore, *  God  formed  the  wicked  man,  therefore  he \nis  not  wicked/  For  how  can  it  be  that  he  is \nnot  wicked,  springing  as  he  does  from  a  wicked \nseed  ?  As  he  says  in  Psalm  li.  \"  Behold  I  was \nconceived  in  sins.\"  And  Job  says,  \"  Who  can \nmake  clean  that  which  has  been  conceived  of \nunclean  seed?\"  For  although  God  does  not  make \nsin,  still  he  ceases  not  to  form  and  to  multiply  a \nnature  which  has  been  corrupted  by  sin,  through \nthe  withdrawal  of  the  Spirit:  just  as  if  a  car- \npenter should  make  statues  of  rotten  wood. \nThus  men  are  made  just  such  as  their  nature \nis,  through  God's  creating  and  forming  them  of \nthat  nature.2 \n\nz  Luther  has  not  exactly  hit  the  nail  upon  the  head  here. \nHe  declares  that  God  makes  '  wicked  man;'  and  that  he  so \nmakes  him,  through  the  faultiness  of  the  materials  which  he  has \nto  work  with,  being  fitly  compared  to  c  a  carpenter  who  should \nmake  statues  of  rotten  wood.'  Moreover,  this  faultiness  of  the \nmaterials  arose  from  the  sin  of  the  first  man-  who  was  created \nhaving  the  Spirit,  what  he  elsewhere  calls  c  the  firstfruits  of \nthe  Spirit,'  (Part  hi.  Sect,  xviii.)  which  he  lost  by  his  sin  and \nfall  -,  being  thenceforth  deserted  of  God,  and  left  to  himself. — I \ndeem  both  these  propositions  objectionable  and  false.  Neither \ndoth  God  make  sinners  ;  neither  did  he  withdraw  the  Spirit \nfrom  Adam  by  reason  of  his  sin,  and  so,  through  him,  from  the \nrace  which  has  sprung  from  him  ;  for  he  never  had  it. — When \nGod  created  man  in  his  own  image,  he  created  every  man. \nThe  substance  of  every  individual  man  and  woman  which  exists, \nhath  existed,  and  shall  exist  till  the  trumpet  shall  sound  and \nthe  dead  shall  be  raised,  was  enclosed  in  the  first  man,  Adam. \nNo  ne0  matter  of  human  kind  has  been  brought  into  existence \nsince  that  moment  5  no  human  being  has  been  created  thero- \n\n\n262  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.       Secondly   I    answer,   if  you   will  have    those \nwords,  \"  were  very  good/'  to  be  understood  of \n\nfore,  posterior  to  it.  (See  Locke's  Essay,  book  ii.  chap.  xxvi. \nsect.  2.)     Nor  was  this  creation  the  mere  production  of  a  mass \nof  human  substance,  like  so  much  clay  in  the  hands  of  a  potter \nwhich  was   afterwards    to  be   moulded  into   distinct   vessels. \nDistinctness  and  individuality  of  subsistence  was  given  to  the \nseveral  individuals  of  the  human  race  in  that  instant.     This \nappears,  as  well  from  other   considerations  which  might   be \nstated,   as  from  these  eminently ;    1 .  Man  is   spoken  of,  and \nspoken  to,  as  plural.   (\"  Let  them  have  dominion.\"   \"  Male  and \nfemale  created  he  them.\"     \"  God  blessed  them,  and  God  said \nunto  them,  Be  ye  fruitful  and  multiply.\"  \"  And  called  their  name \nAdam,  in  the  day  when  they  were  created.\")     2.  God  is  de- \nclared to  have  created  them  male  and  female  :  a  fact  which  the \nLord  Jesus  refers  to  (Matt.  xix.  4,  5.  Mark  x.  6.),  as  indicative \nof  his  Father's  will  concerning  marriage.   (It  is  clearly  not  the \nformation  of  Eve  to  which  he  refers,  but  that  act  of  creation \nwhich   distinctly   preceded    the    making   of  the   help-meet.) \n3.  God  is  said  to  have  chosen  his  people  to  be  in  Christ  before \nthe  foundation  of  the  world  ;  which  implies  that  the  whole  race \nwas  contemplated  as  personally  and  individually  subsistent,  in \na  state  prior  to  the  exercise  of  that  choice. — Having  thus  given \na  distinct  personal  subsistence  to  every  individual  of  the  human \nrace  in    Adam,  when  the  Lord   God   added  the   procreative \npower,  and  gave  command  to  exercise  it ;  essentially  he   did \nmake  every  individual :  the  substance  about  to  come  forth,  in \nthe  Lord's  time,  into  manifest  existence  and  distinct  personal \nagency,  was   already  formed  •    the  power  and   the   authority \nwhich  would  be  necessary  to  its  production,  were  superadded. \nThen,  if  this  was  God's  '  condidit'   (Luther's  term — '  made,' \n<  formed,'  'builded'),  hath  He  made  '  wicked  man?'     Is  not \nthat  saying  of  the  Preacher  hereby,  and  hereby  only,  shewn  to \nbe  true,  u  God  hath  made  man  upright?\"   (Eccles.  vii.  29.)  — \nThe  only  consideration,  which  can  have^my  shew  of  involving \nGod  in  the  propagation  of  the  wicked,  is,  that  he  did  not  at \nonce  destroy  the  offender,  and  those  who  had  offended  in  him. \nBut,  without  here  suggesting  counsel  and  design  (we  are  deal- \ning with  facts) ,  the  living  substances  were  formed ;  the  power \nand  the  authority  for  production  had  been  given  -,  a  curse  was \nupon  them,  which   they  must  be  brought  out  into  manifest \nexistence  that  they  might  be   seen   and   known  to  bear. — I \ncannot  but  remark,  that  these,  or  some  such  reasons,  which \narise  out  of  the  reality  of  their  previous  distinct  subsistence, \nseem  absolutely  necessary  to  the  vindication  of  God  from  the \ncharge  of  propagating  sin. — If  it  be  asked  then,  but  how  could \nthose  who  had  no  eye  to  see,  no  ear  to  hear,  no  hand  to  put \nforth,  commit  an  act  of  disobedience  ?  The  answer  is,  Adam  was \nthe  sole  personal  agent  (\"  By  one  man  sin  entered  into  the  world/' \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  263 \n\nthe' works  of  God  after  the  fell,  you  will  observe  sect.  x. \nthey  are  spoken  not  of  us,  but  of  God.

Whether \ne0'  to  be  rendered  in  whom,  (\"  through  him  in  whom  all  sin- \nned\"— which  I  greatly  prefer),  or  for  that :  the  words  which \nfollow  make  it  plain,  that  c  all  men '  are  dealt  with — or  rather, \nall  men,  from  Adam  to  Moses,  were  dealt  with — on  the \nground  of  the  first  transgression. — I  have  no  other  clue  to  my \nown  character  ;  I  have  no  other  clue  to  my  own  state.  Nor \ncan  I  otherwise  explain  what  is  thus  made  clear  in  the  spirit \nand  behaviour  of  other  men. — And  does  not  the  church  of \nEngland  recognise  this  account  of  the  matter  in  her  baptismal \nservice,  when  she  prays  that  the  infant  '  may  receive  remission \nof  his  sins  by  spiritual  regeneration-'  and  afterwards  instructs \nthe  priest  to  speak  to  the  god-fathers  and  god-mothers  in  this \nwise  ;  '  Ye  have  prayed  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  would \nvouchsafe  to  release  him  of  his  sins.'  What  sins  r — This  is \nthe  reality  of  (  original  sin  5'  whence  flowed  c  original  guilt  5' \nwhence  flowed  c  depravation  of  nature,'  so  commonly  mistaken \nfor  it.  This  alone  constitutes  every  son  and  daughter  of  fallen \nAdam  a  fallen  creature  3  not  merely  child  of  the  fallen,  but \nthemselves,  individually  and  personally,  fallen  from  their  own \noriginal  uprightness,  in  him. — I  have  hinted  that  this  is  not  the \nplace  to  speak  of  counsel  and  design  ;  with  which  all  this  was \ndone  :  but  it  is  obvious  that  hereby  a  way  was  made  for  that \nfurther  and  more  complete  developement  of  God  (by  the  as- \nsumption of  new  relations),  which  could  not  be  made  by  simple \ncreation,  but  to  which  creation  was  the  stepping-stone.  (See \nPart  hi.  Sect,  xxviii.  notes  *  and  v.) \n\nLuther  is  again  in  mistake  (see  Part  hi.  Sect,  xviii.  note  fc) \nabout  the  creation  state  of  man  ■  speaking  as  though  the  pos- \nsession of  the  Spirit  were  a  part  of  his  endowments. — '  Deser- \n\ntus  a  Deo  ac  sibi  relictus' e  naturam  peccato,  subtract© \n\nspiritu,  vitiatam.'— The  Lord  God  having  formed  his  animal \nstructure  out  of  the  dust  of  the  ground — a  compound  mass — ■ \nbreathed  into  his  nostrils  breath  of  <c  lifes,\"  and  man  became \na  living  soul.  This  continuity  of  soul  and  body — simple  soul, \nand  compounded  body — soul,  which  was  an  image  of  Him  that \nis  a  Spirit  5  and  body,  in  which  he  resembled  and  was  par- \ntaker with  the  brutes — constituted  his  essential  nature  $  the \nsolution  of  which  continuity  constitutes  death.     So  constituted. \n\n\n264  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  IV.  not  say,  man   saw  the   things   which   God  had \nmade,  and  they  were  very  good.     Many  things \n\nhe  had  capacities  with  which  to  learn,  and  sources  of  instruc- \ntion from  which  to  derive  much  knowledge  of  God.  The  Lord \nGod  conversed  with  him  face  to  face,  and  he  dwelt  amongst  the \nteaching  creatures  of  His  hand ;  even  as  he  was  himself  the \nmost  teaching  of  all  creatures.  But  where  is  the  Spirit  ? \nmeaning  the  Holy  Ghost.  Had  he  possessed  this — had  the \nSpirit  dwelt  and  walked  in  Him — that  is,  been  continually  pre- \nsent with  Him,  acting  in  Him  and  by  Him — he  had  possessed \nunion  with  God  :  a  privilege  which  was  not  essential  to  his \ncondition  and  relation  as  the  moral  creature  of  God,  but  which \nmight,  or  might  not,  be  added  to  it.  That  it  was  not  added  is \nplain,  as  from  other  considerations,  so  from  this  ;  that  if  it  was \nadded,  then  it  was  either  conquered  in  the  temptation,  or  with- \ndrawn previous  to  it  :  I  know  not  what  a  conquered  Holy \nGhost  can  mean;  and  if  withdrawn  prior  to  the  temptation,  its \nwithdrawal  would  constitute  him  a  different  creature  from  that \nto  which  the  temptation  law  had  been  given.* — But  now, \nbeing  simply  a  creature,  and  therefore  mutable,  he  was  liable \nto  fall  by  temptation.  Accountability  implies  account  to  be \nrendered  5  account  implies  trial ;  trial  implies  the  presence  of \nthat  in  the  tried  substance  which  may  be  turned  to  evil.  Was \nnot  this  precisely  Adam's  state  and  constitution  ?  '.  Good,' \n'  very  good,'  as  he  came  out  of  the  hands  of  his  Creator,  his \ngood  might  be  made  evil.  Those  appetites  and  passions,  the \nappendages  of  his  will ;  which,  in  his  creation,  and  until  evil \nwas  suggested  from  without,  were  pure,  fixed  on  fit  objects, \nand  acted  in  purity  ;  were  liable  to  be  turned  to  other  objects, \nand  thus  to  become  evil.  Desire  of  knowledge,  desire  of \npleasant  food,  taking  pleasure  in  Avhat  is  beautiful  to  the  eye — \nall  of  which  were  sound  and  pure  in  creation — might  thus,  by \nsuggestions  thrown  in,  become  evil :  as  infectious  fever,  or  the \nserpent's  bite,  poisons  healthful  blood.  If  no  evil  were  sug- \ngested, there  would  continue  only  good ;  the  suggestion,  by \nbeing  entertained,  mars  them. — Then,  was  God  debtor  to \nAdam,  to  withhold  temptation  from  him  3  or  to  minister  super- \n\n*  Luther's  misapprehension  has  much  to  do  with  a  mistake  about  the \nSpirit's  actings.  He  seems  to  have  thought,  as  many  now  do,  that  there \nmight  be  a  sort  of  '  fast  and  loose'  playings  of  the  Spirit.  The  Spirit, \nwhen  given,  acts  in  earnest  and  efficaciously. — Would  Luther  say,  '  does  he \nalways  act  efficaciously  in. the  Lord's  called  people,  now/'  I  answer,  the \ncases  are  not  parallel.  We  have  the  Spirit  not  as  our  own,  and  in  our  Adam \nselves,  but  in  Christ.  When  we  fall,  it  is  not  '  the  Spirit  conquered,'  but \nthe  Spirit  not  energizing  :  what  could  not  have  happened  to  Adam. — Luther's \nexpressions  are  ambiguous  as  to  the  period  when  the  Spirit  was  withdrawn ; \nwhether  before,  or  after  the  temptation.  In  a  former  note  (Part  iii.  Sect,  xviii. \nnote  t)  I  have  dealt  with  him  as  representing  it  to  have  been  withdrawn \nbefore  the  temptation.  A  careful  comparison  of  the  several  passages  in \nwhich  he  refers  to  it  leads  me  to  conclude,  that  he  supposed  it  not  withdrawn \ntill  after  the  sin  had  been  committed. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  265 \n\nseem  very  good  to  God,  and  are  so;  which  to  us  SECT.xi. \nappear  very  bad,  and  are  so.

They  are  turned \nperpetually  towards  their  own  desires,  so  that \nthey  cannot  but  seek  what  is  their  own,  and  not \nhis.0  This  will  and  nature  of  theirs  therefore, \nwhich  is  thus  averse  from  God,  still  remains  a \nsomething.  Satan  and  the  wicked  man  are  not  a \nnothing,  having  no  nature  or  will,  though  they \nhave  a  nature  which  is  corrupt  and  averse  from \nGod.  This  remainder  of  nature,  therefore,  in  the \nwicked  man  and  in  Satan,  of  which  we  speak, \nseeing  it  is  the  creature  and  work  of  God, \nis  not  less  subject  to  omnipotency  and  to  divine \nactings,  than  all  the  other  creatures  and  works  of \nGod. \n\nSince  then  God  moves  and  actuates  all  things \nin  all  things,  it  cannot  be  but  that  he  also  moves \nand  acts  in  Satan  and  in  the  wicked.  But  he  acts \nin  them  according  to  what  they  are,  and  what  he \nfinds  them  ;  that  is,  since  they  are  averse  from  him \nand  wicked,  and  are  hurried  along  by  this  im- \npulse of  the  divine  omnipotency,  they  do  only \nsuch  things  as  are  averse  from  him  and  wicked. \nJust  as  a  horseman,  driving  a  horse  which  is  lame \nin  one  or  two  of  his  feet,  drives  him  according  to \nhis  make  and  power  ;  and  so  the  horse  goes  ill. \nBut  what  can  the  horseman  do?  he  drives  the \nhorse  such  as  he  is  in  a  drove  of  sound  horses ; \nhe  makes  him  go  ill,  the  others  well ; f  it  cannot \nbe  otherwise,  unless  the  horse  be  cured.  By  this \nillustration  you  see  how  it  is,  that,  when  God \nworks  in  bad  men  and  by  bad  men,  evil  is  the \nresult;  but  it  cannot  be  that  God  cloeth  wickedly, \nalthough  he   works   evil  by  the  agency  of  evil \n\nd  Ephes.  i.  2. \n\ne  Self  is  their  idol,  to  the  dethronement  of  God.

The  fault  therefore  is  in  the  instru- \nments, which  God  does  not  suffer  to  remain  idle, \nthat  evil  is  done;  God,  meanwhile,  himself  being \nthe  impeller  of  them.  Just  as  if  a  carpenter  should \ncut  ill  by  cutting  with  an  axe  that  is  c  toothed  and \nsawed/  Hence  it  arises,  that  the  wicked  man \ncannot  but  go  astray  and  commit  sin  continually ; \ninasmuch  as  being  seized  and  urged  by  the  power \nof  God,  he  is  not  allowed  to  remain  idle;  but \nwills,  desires,  acts,  just  according  to  what  he  is.h \n\ns  This  is  very  much  like  saying  '  doeth  good  because  he  is \ngood,  and  is  good  because  he  is  good.'— It  is  too  much  like  the \n*  ipse  dixit'  of  the  Pythagoreans. \n\nh  The  amount  of  Luther's  explanation  of  the  mystery  of \nGod's  agency  in  the  wicked,  as  given  in  his  folly,  is,  1 .  That \nthey  are  still  real  existences.  2.  Still  God's  creatures.  3.  That \nhe  works  all  things  in  them,  even  as  he  does  in  all  his  crea- \ntures. 4.  That  he  works  in  them  according  to  their  nature  : \nthat  hence  he  does  all  their  evil  in  them,  but  does  no  evil  himself. \nAll  this  is  true ;  but  it  is  baldly  told,  and  wants  opening, \nconfirmation,  and  some  additions.  He  ought  to  shew  us  how \nman  came  to  be  what  he  is,  in  consistency  with  God's  volun- \ntarily contracted  obligations  to  him  ;  he  ought  to  shew  us  the \nnature  and  manner  of  his  agency  in  the  wicked  ;  he  ought  to \nshew  us  how  God,  in  consistency  with  himself,  ordained  and \nwrought  the  fall,  and  continues  wicked  man  in  being ;  yea, \nworks  wickedness  by  him,  instead  of  destroying  him  and  put- \nting an  end  to  the  reign  of  evil. — I  say,  he  ought  to  have  shewn \nthese  things  ;  because,  though  he  talks  of  *  silliness'  and  '  fool- \nishness,' and  '  babbling,'*  it  is  plain  that  he  means  a  serious \nand  sober  solution  of  the  difficulty. — Then,  with  respect  to  the \nfirst  of  these  shewings,  man,  as  we  have  seen  in  a  former  note,f \nhad  a  constitution  imparted,  and  a  state  assigned  to  him,  in \nwhich  trial  was  implied,  and  in  which  he  ought  to  have  overcome \ntemptation.  There  was  no  dereliction  of  the  Creator's  engage- \nments, no  withdrawal  of  any  possession  or  privilege,  no \ngainsaying  discession  or  addition,  with  respect  to  God's \nprevious  announcements,  either  in  the  operation  of  the \nfall,  or  in  the  inflictions  Which  followed  it.

This  is  moral  neces- \nsity; such  a  will  so  addressed  cannot  choose  differently. — Then, \nwith  respect  to  the  third  of  these  shewings,  God's  most  gra- \ncious and  everlasting  design  of  making  himself  known  to,  and \nenjoyed  by,  certain  creatures  of  his  hands,  according  to  what \nHe  really  is,  affords  the  ample  and  adequate  reason  for  all  that \ncomplex,  yet  simple,  system  of  operation,  by  which  he  has  been \ndealing  with  man  from  the  creation  to  this  hour,  and  shall \ncontinue  to  and  throughout  eternity  to  deal  with  him  : — with \nman,  his  great  manifester,  not  only  in  the  blessed  human  per- \nson of  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  (see  Part  ii.  Sect.  viii.  note  r),  but \nalso  in  every  individual  substance  of  the  whole  human  race; \nwhich  is  made  to  manifest  itself,  that  he  may  manifest  himself \nby  his  doings  with  it. — A  sight  like  this  justifies  wisdom  to  her \nchildren  :  and,  although  these  considerations  may  seem  to  apply \nthemselves  exclusively  to  God's  dealings  with  the  wicked  5  or \nat  farthest,  with  men  -,  they  will  require  but  little  extension,  to \ncomprehend  all  creatures.  Evil  has  been  introduced  into  the \ncreation  of  God,  and  is  not  destroyed,  but  continues  therein, \nand  shall  so  continue,  unto  God's  glory  :  because  he  could  not \nbe  manifested  as  what  he  is — the  union  and  concentration  of \nall  moral  excellency — the  truth,  the  love,  the  power,  the \nwisdom — the  good  one — without  it. — And  what  is  this  *  evil,' \nwhich  has  thus  come  into,  and  thus  abides  in  God's  world  ?  a \nperson — as  we  are  apt  to  account  it,  having  scriptural  autho- \nrity for  so  speaking  of  it ;  but  thinking  so  of  it,  too  often  to  our \nhurt  ? — Hear  what  a  venerable  confessor  of  the  Church  has  to \nsay  about  it.*  '  I  now  began  to  understand,  that  every  crea- \nture of  thine  hand  is  in  its  nature  good,  and  that  universal \nnature  is  justly  called  on  to  praise  the  Lord  for  his  goodness. \n(Psalm  cxlviii.)  The  evil  which  I  sought  after  has  no  positive \nexistence  ;  were  it  a  substance,  it  would  be  good,  because  every \nthing  individually,  as  well  as  all  things  collectively,  is  good. \nEvil  appeared  to  be  a  want  of  agreement  in  some  parts  to  others. \nMy  opinion  of  the  two  independent  principles,  in  order  to \naccount  for  the  origin  of  evil,  was  without  foundation.!

I  asked  what  was  iniquity,  and  I  found \nit  to  be  no  substance,  but  a  perversity  of  the  will,  which  de- \nclines from  thee,  the  supreme  substance,  to  lower  things,  and \ncasts  away  its  internal  excellencies,  and  swells  with  pride \nexternally.' — If  it  be  true  then,  that  the  creature,  as  creature,  is \nessentially  mutable  (what  Augustine,  and  the  schoolmen  after \nhim,  applies  to  the  now  corrupted  state  of  the  human  will* \nbeing  equally  applicable  to  the  will  of  man — to  the  will  of  every \nmoral  creature — in  its  essence ;  viz.  that  it  is  vertible) ;  if  there \nsubsist  what  may  fitly  be  compared  to  a  chord  in  every  moral \ncreature,  which  may  be  so  touched  as  to  yield  a  jarring  note, \nand  by  its  vibration  to  produce  discord  throughout  the  whole \ninstrument  j  if  this  chord,  which  is  not  in  itself  evil,  may  be \nso  touched  by  that  which  is  not  evil  neither,  but  good  (is  not \nself-love  such  a  chord,  and  is  not  the  sense  of  God's  incompa- \nrable excellency,  or  the  intimation  of  superiority  in  some  other \nlike  creature  of  God's,  or  the  suggestion  of  some  flaw,  blemish, \nor  deficiency  in  the  creature  itself — each  of  which  ought  only  to \nexcite  humility,  submission,  and  gratitude — such  a  touch  ?)  j \ncan  we  have  any  difficulty  in  conceiving  how  Satan  was  with- \ndrawn from  his  uprightness,  when  as  he  was  yet  only  good, \nand  nothing  but  good  was  to  be  heard  and  seen  around  him  ? — \nI  am  not  ignorant  that  some  would  divert  us  altogether  from \ncontemplations  of  this  kind :  but  why  are  we  told  so  much \nabout  the  devil,  if  we  are  to  have  no  thoughts  about \nhis  history  and  origin  ?

Thus  it  comes  to  pass,  that  he  of \nnecessity  errs  and  sins  perpetually,  until  he  he \nrectified  by  the  Spirit  of  God.  Howbeit,  in  all \nthese  Satan  as  yet  reigns  in  peace  and  keeps  his \npalace  in  quietness,  in  subordination  to  this  im- \npulse of  the  divine  omnipotency.  After  this  fol- \nlows the  business  of  hardening;  which  is  in  this \nwise.  The  wicked  man,  as  I  have  said  (and  the \nsame  is  true  of  Satan  his  prince  also),  is  occupied \naltogether  with  himself  and  his  own  matters ;  he \ndoes  not  inquire  after  God,  nor  care  for  those \nthings  which  are  God's  \\  but  seeks  his  own  wealth, \nhis  own  glory,  his  own  works,  his  own  wisdom, \nhis  own  power ;  a  kingdom,  in  short,  of  his  own ; \nand  what  he  wants  is  to  enjoy  these  things  in \npeace.  Now,  if  any  one  resist  him,  or  have  a \nmind  to  diminish  ought  from  these  possessions, \nhis  aversion,  indignation,  and  rage  with  which  he \nis  stirred  up  against  his  adversary,  are  not  less \nvehement  than  his  desire  with  which  he  pursues \nafter  these  possessions  :  and  he  is  just  as  incapable \nof  restraining  his  rage  as  he  is  of  restraining  his \ndesire  and  pursuit;  and  just  as  incapable  of  re- \nstraining his  desire  as  of  putting  an  end  to  his \nexistence  :  of  which  he  is  incapable,  inasmuch  as \nhe  is  the  creature  of  God,  though  a  vitiated  one. \n\nThis  is  the  history  of  that  rage  of  the  world \nagainst  God's  Gospel.  That  stronger  than  he, \nwhich  is  to  conquer  the  quiet  possessor  of  the \npalace,  comes  by  the  Gospel ;  condemning  those \ndesires  of  glory  and  riches,  and  of  his  own  wis- \ndom and  righteousness  ;  in  short,  every  thing  in \nwhich  he  confides.  This  same  provoking  of  the \nwicked,  which  is  effected  by  God's  saying  or  doing \nsomething  contrary  to  their  wishes,  is  the  harden- \ning and  burdening  of  them.     For,  whereas  they \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  271 \n\nare  averse  of  themselves  through  the  very  corrup-  sec.xiii. \n\ntion  of  their  nature,  they  are  also  turned  yet  more  ~ \n\nout  of  the  way,  and  made  worse,  by  being  resisted \nand  robbed,  under  their  averseness.  Thus,  when \nGod  was  proceeding  to  snatch  his  usurped  domi- \nnion out  of  the  hands  of  the  wicked  Pharaoh,  he \nprovoked  him,  and  did  yet  more  harden  and \nweigh  down  his  heart  by  assailing  him  with  the \nwords  of  Moses,  who  threatened  to  take  away \nhis  kingdom,  and  to  withdraw  the  people  from  his \ndominion  :  meanwhile,  he  gave  him  not  the  Spirit \nwithin,  but  allowed  his  own  wicked  and  corrupt \nnature,  in  wkieh  Satan  was  reigning,  to  grow  red \nhot,  to  boil  over,  to  rage  and  get  to  its  height, \naccompanied  with  a  sort  of  vain  confidence  and \ncontemptuousness. \n\nLet  not  any  one  think  therefore,  that  God,  Mistakes \nwhen  he  is  said  to  harden,  or  to  work  evil  in  us  Prohlblted« \n(for  to  harden  is  to  make  evil),  does  so  by  creating \nevil  as  it  were  anew  in  us:  just  as  you  might \nfancy  a  malignant  vintner,  full  of  mischief  himself, \nwhilst  none  is  in  his  vessel,  to  pour  or  mix  poi- \nson into  or  with  the  same  ;  the  vessel  all  the \nwhile  doing  nothing  itself,  save  that  it  receives \nor  endures  the  malignancy  of  the  mixer.  For \nwhen  they  hear  it  said,  that  God  works  both  good \nand  evil  in  us,  and  that  we  are  subjected  to \nthe  operations  of  God  by  a  mere  passive  neces- \nsitj^ ;  many  seem  to  fancy,  that  man,  a  good  sort \nof  creature,  or  at  least  not  a  bad  one,  is,  in  some \nsuch  way  as  this,  made  the  subject  of  a  bad  work \nof  God's.  These  persons  do  not  sufficiently \nconsider  what  a  restless  sort  of  actor  God  is,  in \nall  his  creatures,  and  how  he  suffers  none  of  them \nto  have  a  holyda}r.  But  let  him  who  would  have \nany  understanding  about  such  sayings  settle  it \nthus  with   himself;   that  God  works   evil   in  us  , \n\n(that  is,  by  us),  not  through  any  fault  of  his,  but \nthrough  our  own  faultiness :  we  being  by  nature \nevil,  and  God  good,  he  hurries  us  along  by  means \n\n\n272  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  IV.  of  his  own  agency  (such  is  the  nature  of  his  omni- \npotency),  and,  good  as  he  is  in  himself,  cannot \ndo  otherwise  than  work  evil  by  an  evil  instru- \nment; which  he  makes  a  good  use  of  however \n(such  is  his  wisdom),  by  turning  it  to  his  own \nglory  and  our  salvation.1 \n\nIn  like  manner,  he  finds  the  will  of  Satan  evil \nwithout  creating  it  so;  what  has  become  such, \nthrough  God's  deserting  of  him  and  Satan's  sin- \nning ;  and  finding  it  so,  he  lays  hold  of  it  in  the \ncourse  of  his  operations,  and  moves  it  whither- \nsoever he  will :  yet  this  will  does  not  cease  to  be \nevil,  because  God  thus  moves  it.  Just  so,  David \nsays  of  Shimei  (2  Sam.  xvi.  10.),  \"  Let  him  curse, \nfor  God  hath  commanded  him  to  curse  David.\" — \nHow  does  God  command  him  to  curse  ?  such  a \nmalignant  and  wicked  act !  There  was  no  exter- \nnal commandment  of  this  kind  to  be  found  any \nwhere.  David  then  has  regard  to  this  consi- \nderation, that  the  omnipotent  God  speaks,  and  it \nis  done ;  that  is,  he  doeth  all  things  by  his  eternal \nword.  So  then,  the  divine  agency  and  omni po- \ntency seizes  hold  of  the  will  of  Shimei,  together \nwith  all  his  members — that  will  which  was  already \nevil,  and  which  had  aforetime  been  inflamed \nagainst  David;  who  met  him  just  at  the  right \nmoment,  as  having  deserved  such  a  cursing — and \neven  the  good  God  commands  (that  is,  he  speaks \nthe  word  and  it  is  done)  this  curse,  which  is \npoured  out  by  a  wicked  and  blasphemous  organ, \ninasmuch  as  he  seizes  hold  of  that  organ,  and  car- \nries it  along  with  him  in  the  course  of  his  own \nagency. \nSEC. xiv.       Thus  he  hardens  Pharaoh,  when  he  presents  his \n\nfc ■  words  and  works  to  his  wicked  and  evil  will ; \n\nPharaoh's    whicn  that  will  hates,  through  innate  faultiness, \n\ncase  con  si-  7  °  ' \n\n1  The  wheels  of  God's  omnipotent  providence  (see  Ezek.  i. \n15 — 21.)  carry  the  evil  as  well  as  the  good  along  with  them  in \ntheir  goings  :  and  this  unto  God's  glory  j  but  is  it  unto  salva- \ntion also  1 — This  is  Luther's  defective  view. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  273 \n\nno  doubt,  and  natural   corruption.    Now,  when  sec.xiv. \n\nGod  does  not  change  this  will  inwardly  by  his  \n\nSpirit,  but  persists  in  presenting  and  obtruding \nhis  words  and  works;  and  when  Pharaoh,  on  the \nother  hand,  considering  his  strength,  wealth  and \npower,  confides  in  them,  through  the  same  natural \npravity;  it  comes  to  pass,  that,  being  puffed  up \nand  exalted  by  his  own  fancied  greatness,  on  the \none  hand,  and  being  rendered  a  proud  despiser \nby  the  meanness  as  well  of  Moses  as  of  the  word \nof  God  which  comes  to  him  in  an  abject  form, \non  the  other;  he  is  first  hardened,  and  then  more \nand  more  provoked  and  aggravated,  the  more \nMoses  urges  and  threatens  him.  This  evil  will \nof  his,  however,  would  not  of  itself  be  stirred  up \nto  action,  or  hardened ;  but  since  the  omnipotent \nactor  drives  it  along  as  he  does  the  rest  of  his \ncreatures,  by  an  inevitable  impulse,  will  it  must. \nAdd  to  this,  that  He  at  the  same  time  presents \nfrom  without  that  which  naturally  irritates  and \noffends  it;  so  that  Pharaoh  cannot  avoid  being \nhardened  any  more  than  he  can  avoid  the  agency \nof  the  divine  omnipotence,  and  the  aversation  or \nmalignancy  of  his  own  will.  So  that  Pharaoh's \nhardening  by  God  is  completed  thus;  he  sets \nbefore  his  maliciousness  that  which  he  of  his  own \nnature  hates  from  without;  after  this  he  ceases \nnot  to  stimulate  that  evil  will,  just  such  as  he  finds \nit,  by  his  own  omnipotent  impulse  within.  The \nman  meanwhile,  such  being  the  wickedness  of  his \nwill,  cannot  but  hate  what  is  contrary  to  himself, \nand  confide  in  his  own  strength.  Thus  he  is  made \nobstinate  to  such  a  degree,  that  he  neither  hears \nnor  has  any  understanding,  but  is  hurried  away \nunder  the  possession  of  the  devil,  like  one  mad \nand  raving.k \n\nk  Luther's  account  of  '  hardening'  is,  1.  God  actuates  the \nwicked  as  well  as  the  rest  of  his  creatures,  according  to \ntheir  nature.  <2.  Satan  is  in  them  unresisted  and  undisturbed. \n3.

If  this  view  of  the  case  be  satisfactory,  I  have \ngained  my  cause  ;  we  agree  to  explode  tropes  and \n\nor  deed,  or  both.  All  this  is  correct  ;  but  it  is  not  the  whole \nof  the  matter ;  neither  does  he  put  the  several  parts  of  the \nmachinery  together,  cleverly  ;  neither  does  he  shew  an  end.  (See \nabove,  Sect.  xi.  note  h.  All  these  things  are  of  God,  through \nGod,  and  to  God.  (Rom.  xi.  36.)  The  natural  man  has  been \nbrought  into  the  state  in  which  he  is,  of,  through,  and  to  him. \nAnd  what  is  that  state  ?  earthly,  sensual,  devilish  soul  (James \niii.  1.6.),  possessed  by  the  devil;  to  whom  it  was  given  up,  as  a \nprey,  in  the  day  of  apostasy.  Luther  distinguishes  the  '  moving \nand  driving,'  or  e  seizing  and  moving,'  of  God,  from  his  (  word \nand  work.'  It  is  a  fine  image  which  he  draws  of  God  giving \nmotion  to  '  all  creature.'  But  if  this  idea  be  examined,  it  will \nbe  found  to  amount  to  no  more  than  that  God  keeps  all  his \ncreatures  in  a  state  of  being  which  is  accordant  to  their  nature  ; \nand  that  the  wicked  therefore  are,  by  the  necessity  of  their \nnature,  kept  by  him  in  a  state  of  activity,  and  not  allowed  to  be \ntorpid,  or,  as  Luther  facetiously  expresses  it,  '  to  have  a  holy- \nday.'  Particular  actings  of  God,  then,  upon  this  substance  of  the \nhuman  soul,  such  and  so  related,  are  what  he  expresses  by \nGod's  '  thwarting  word  and  work:'  but  this  thwarting  word \nand  work  extends  only  to  the  outside  of  the  man  ;foris  offert — \nforis  objicit.  All  this  while,  Satan's  is  an  agency  with  which,  as \nit  respects  others,  God  does  not  interfere  :  he  is  no  agent,  no \nminister  of  His.  Y6u  might  almost  judge  from  his  language \nin  some  places  (contradicted  it  is  true  by  others),  that  he  ac- \ncounted Satan  a  sort  of  independent  chief. — Now  here,  if  I  mis- \ntake not,  the  root  of  the  matter  lies.  Satan  is  an  agent  and \nminister  of  God.  (See  Job  i.  11.  1  Kings  xxii.  19 — 23.  1  Chron. \nxxi.  1.  Compare  2  Sam.  xxiv.  1.  Zech.  iii.  1 — 3.)  Nor  can  I \nunderstand  the  expressions  so  repeatedly  applied  to  the  case  of \nPharaoh,  \"I  will  harden  Pharaoh's  heart;\"  nor  \"Whom  he \nwill  he  hardeneth;\"  nor  \"  God  hath  given  them  the  spirit \nof  slumber;\"  nor  \"Thou  hast  hid  these  things  from  the \nwise  and  prudent;\"  and  the  like — without  recurring  to  this \nagency  :  which  obviously  meets  their  full  and  express  import, \nwhilst  nothing  else,  or  less,  does. — And  what  is  the  effect  of \nthis  agency  but  such  as  hath  been  already  ascribed  to  the  ope- \nration of  God  ?  (see  note  h,  as  before)  hereby  *  He  sets,  or \ncauses  to  be  set,  such  considerations  (it  might  be  added,  and \ncauses  such  to  be  withheld — for  Satan  throws  dust  into  men's \neyes  ;  hinders  them  from  seeing,  as  well  as  causes  them  to  see \nwrongly)  before  the  mind  of  His  free-agent,  as  morally  constrain \nhim  to  choose  what  He  hath  willed. — 0  what  is  there  that  can \ngive  peace  under  the  realizing  consciousness  of  his  being  and \nagency,  but  the  assurance  that  he  is  in  truth  only  this  agent  of \nGod  for  good,  and  nothing  but  good,  to  his  chosen  ? — God's \nhardening>  therefore,  I  define  generally  to  be  ( that  special  opera- \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  275 \n\nthe  glosses  of  men,  and  to  understand  the  words  sec.xiv. \nof  God  literally,  that  it  may  not  be  necessary  to \nmake  excuses  for  God,  or  accuse  him  of  injustice. \nWhen  he  says,  I  will  harden  Pharaoh's  heart,  he \nspeaks  in  plain  language,  as  if  he  should  say,  I \nwill  cause  that  the  heart  of  Pharaoh  shall  be  hard- \nened; or,  that  it  shall  be  hardened  through  my \ndoings  and  workings.  How  this  is  effected,  we \nhave  heard :  it  shall  be  by  my  exciting  his  own \nevil  will  inwardly  by  that  general  sort  of  impulse  by \nwhich  I  move  all  things,  so  that  he  shall  go  on  under \nhis  own  bias,  and  in  his  own  course  of  willing ; \nnor  will  I  cease  to  stimulate  him,  nor  can  I  do \notherwise.  I  will  at  the  same  time  present  him \nwith  a  word  and  a  work,  which  that  evil  bias  of \nhis  will  fall  foul  of;  since  he  can  do  nothing  else \nbut  choose  ill,  whilst  I  stimulate  the  very  sub- \nstance of  the  evil  which  is  in  him,  by  virtue  of  my \nomnipotency. \n\nThus  was  God  most  sure,  and  thus  did  he  with \nthe  greatest  certainty  pronounce,  that  Pharaoh \nshould  be  hardened,  as  being  most  sure,  that \nPharaoh's  will  could  neither  resist  the  excitement \nof  his  omnipotency,  nor  lay  aside  its  own  mali- \nciousness, nor  receive  Moses  as  a  friend  when  pre- \nsenting himself  to  him  as  an  adversary  *  but  that \nhis  will  would  remain  evil,  and  he  would  neces- \nsarily become  worse,  harder  and  prouder,  whilst, \n\ntion  of  God  upon  the  reprobate  soul,  by  which,  through  the \nagency  of  Satan  (whose  Lord  and  rider  he  is),  combined  with \nhis  own  outward  dispensations  of  word  and  work,  he  shuts  and \nseals  it  up  in  its  own  native  blindness,  aversation  and  enmity  to- \nwards himself.'  There  have  been  however,  and  doubtless  are, \ncertain  special  and  splendid  exemplifications  of  this  operation, \neach  having  its  minuter  peculiarities,  whilst  the  same  essential \nnature  pervades  all. — Pharaoh  is  one  of  these. — Indeed  the  whole \nhistory  of  the  Exodus  is  one  of  the  most  luminous  displays, \nwhich  the  Lord  God  hath  ever  made,  of  the  design  he  is  pur- \nsuing and  accomplishing  in  having  and  dealing  with  creatures  • \nsecond  only  to  the  marvellous  and  complicated  history  of  the \nLord's  death  :  whereunto  also  it  was  appointed  5  whereunto  also \nit  hath  been  recorded. \n\nT2 \n\n\n276  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  in  pursuing  his  own  natural  bias  and  course,  he \n\n—  encountered  an  opposition  which  he  did  not  like, \n\nand  which  he  despised  through  a  confidence  in \nhis  own  powers.  Thus,  you  see  it  here  confirmed \neven  by  this  very  assertion,  that  Freewill  can  do \nnothing  but  evil ;  seeing  that  God,  who  neither \nis  mistaken  through  ignorance,  nor  lies  through \nwickedness,  so  confidently  promises  the  hardening \nof  Pharaoh's  heart;  being  sure  forsooth,  that  an \nevil  will  can  will  only  evil,  and,  if  a  good  which \ncontravenes  its  own  lust  be  proposed  to  it,  can \nonly  be  made  worse  thereby.1 \nsec.  xv.        It  remains   therefore,    that   a   man   may  ask, \n\n6  Why  doth  not  God  cease  from  that  very  stimu- \n\nimperti-      ]ati0n  of  his  omnipotency  by  which  the  wicked \n\nnent  ques-  f  J       J-  . \n\ntionsmay  man's  will  is  stirred  up  to  continue  in  its  wicked- \nstill  be  ness,  and  to  wax  worse?'  I  answer,  '  This  is  to \ndesire  that  God  should  cease  to  be  God  for  the \nsake  of  the  wicked,  if  you  wish  his  power  and \nagency  to  cease ;  in  fact,  it  is  to  desire  that  God \nshould  cease  to  be  good,  least  they  should  be \nmade  worse/ — But  why  doth  he  not  at  the  same \ntime  change  those  evil  wills  which  he  excites? \nThis  appertaineth  to  the  secrets  of  his  Majesty ; \nin  which  his  judgments  are  incomprehensible. \nWe  have  no  business  to  ask  this  question;  our \nbusiness  is  to  adore  these  mysteries  :  and  if  flesh \nand  blood  be  offended  here  and  murmur,  let  it \nmurmur,  pray  :  it  will  get  no  forwarder  however  ; \nGod  will  not  be  changed  for  these  murmurs. \nAnd  what  if  ungodly  men  go  away  scandal- \nized in  great  numbers  ?  The  elect  will  remain \nnotwithstanding. — The  same  answer  shall  be  given \nto  those  who  ask,  c  Why  he  allowed  Adam  to  fall, \n\n1  \"  Let  my  people  go  that  they  may  serve  me,\"  is  a  good \ndemand  •  but  is  directly  contrary  to  Pharaoh's  will,  its  course \nand  propensity.  (See  the  preceding  note.) — Luther  makes  this \nact  of  God  negative ;  save,  as  respects  God's  general  and  par- \nticular operations  in  his  providence.  He  does  not  change  the \nwill ;  he  keeps  his  moral  creature  in  being  j  he  thwarts  his  in- \nclinations.— What  is  Satan,  meanwhile  ;  and  what  does  he  ? \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  277 \n\nand  why  he  goes  on  to  make  all  of  us.,  who  are  sec.xvi. \ninfected  through  the  same  sin;  when  he  might  ; \nhave  kept  him  from  sinning;  and  might  either  have \ncreated  us  from  another  stock,  or  have  purged \nthe  corrupted  seed  first?'  He  is  God :  whose  will \nhas  no  cause  or  reason™  which  can  be  prescribed \nto  it  for  rule  and  measure  ;  seeing  it  hath  no  equal \nor  superior,  but  is  itself  the  rule  of  all  things.  If \nit  had  any  rule  or  measure,  or  cause  or  reason, \nit  could  not  any  longer  be  the  will  of  God.  For \nwhat  he  wills  is  not  right,  because  he  ought  to \nwill  so,  or  ought  to  have  willed  so  :  on  the  con- \ntrary, because  he  wills  so,  therefore  what  is  done \nmust  be  right.  Cause  and  reason  are  prescribed \nto  the  creature's  will,  but  not  to  the  Creator's; \nunless  you  would  set  another  Creator  over  his \nhead.n \n\nBy  these  considerations  the  trope-making  Dia-  The  trope \n\nm  Nulla  est  causa,  nee  ratio.']  Cau.  is  the  correlative  of  effect ; \n'  what  gives  origin  to  this  will :'  rat.  e  the  principle,  rate, \nmethod,  and  design  of  its  operations  5'  which  supposes  some \n.extrinsic  standard.  There  is  no  such  source,  or  standard,  for \nGod's  will :  no  cause  which  produces  it  j  no  Tightness  which  it \nexemplifies. \n\nn  The  defects  of  Luther's  theology  are  strongly  manifested \nin  this  paragraph.  He  has  no  ansAver  to  give,  where  a  satis- \nfactory one  is  at  hand  :  God  continues  to  move  the  wicked, \nbecause  it  is  for  his  glory  that  they  should  go  on  to  act,  just \nsuch  as  they  are. — For  the  same  cause  he  ordained  and  brought \nabout,  or,  as  Luther  speaks,  permitted  Adam's  fall. — God  does \nnot  create*  wicked  men.  (See  above,  Sect.  x.  note  z.) — God's \nwill  is  cause  and  reason  to  itself:  but  he  has  a  reason  for \nall  he  does ;  and  this  reason,  so  far  as  respects  his  actings  with \nwhich  we  have  to  do,  is  resolvable  into  self-manifestation. \n(See  former  notes.) — As  to  these  and  such  like  questions, \nwhich  Luther  judges  it  improper  to  ask,  the  whole  matter  is, \ndoth  the  word  of  God  furnish  an  answer  to  them,  or  not  ?  If \nit  does,  we  are  bound  to  entertain  them  and  supply  the  true \n\n*  Strange  that  he  should  use  the  word  '  creare,'  as  applied  to  our  gene- \nration from  Adam. — '  When  a  thing  is  made  up  of  particles  which  did  all  of \nthem  before  exist,  but  that  very  thing,  so  constituted  of  preexisting  particles, \nhad  not  any  existence  before ;  this,  when  referred  to  a  substance  produced \nin  the  ordinary  course  of  nature  by  an  internal  principle,  but  set  on  work  by \nand  received  from  some  external  agent  or  cause,  and  working  by  insensible \nways  which  we  perceive  not,  we  call  generation.' — Locke's  Essay,  vol.  i,  chap, \nxxvi.  sect.  2. \n\n\n278  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  tribe  is  sufficiently  confuted,  I  think;  but  let  us \ncome  to  the  text  itself,  that  we  may  see  what  sort \nwlthPthed    °f  agreement  there  is  between  herself  and   her \ntext.  trope.     It  is  customary  with  all  those  who  elude \n\narguments  by  tropes,  to  despise  the  text  itself \nstoutly,  and  make  it  their  only  labour  to  pick  out \nsome  one  word,  and  torture  it  with  tropes,  and \ncrucify  it  by  the  sense  they  impose  upon  it,  with- \nout having  the  least  regard  to  the  surrounding \ncontext,  or  to  the  words  which  follow  and  pre- \ncede, or  to  the  author's  scope  or  cause.  Thus  it \nis  with  Diatribe  here :  nothing  heeding  what \nMoses  is  about,  or  what  is  the  aim  of  his  dis- \ncourse, she  snatches  this  little  word  '  I  will \nharden'  (which  offends  her)  out  of  the  text,  and \nfashions  it  after  her  own  pleasure;  not  at  all \nconsidering  in  the  meanwhile,  how  it  is  to  be \nbrought  back  and  inserted  again  into  the  text, \nand  to  be  fitted  in  so  as  to  square  with  the  body \nof  the  text.  This  is  just  the  reason,  why  Scripture \nis  accounted  not  quite  clear,  by  those  most  learned \ndoctors  who  have  had  the  greatest  possible  accept- \nance amongst  men  for  so  many  ages.

So  then,  this  trope  is  nothing  at  all  to \nthe  purpose  here ;  since  it  might  be  applied  pro- \nmiscuously to  all  who  sin  under  the  endurance  of \ndivine  indulgence.  At  this  rate,  we  might  say \nthat  all  men  are  hardened :  since  there  is  no  man \nwho  does  not  commit  sin ;  and  no  man  could \ncommit  sin,  if  he  were  not  endured  with  divine \nindulgence.  This  hardening  of  Pharaoh  there- \nfore is  something  different  from,  and  beyond,  that \ngeneral  endurance  of  the  divine  lenity.p \n\nRather,  Moses's  object  is  not  so  much  to  an-  Moses's \nnounce  Pharaoh's  wickedness,  as  God's  truth  and  ^ceta-nob\" \nmercy :  that  the  children  of  Israel  may  not  for-  such  re- \nsooth  mistrust  the  promises  of  God,  by  which  he  Peate(? tes- \nhad  engaged  to  liberate  them.     This  deliverance  t0  God's \nbeing  a  vast  thing,  he  forewarns  them  of  its  dif-  desisn  and \nficulty,  that  their  faith  may  not  falter ;  knowing  hardening \nas  they  thus  would,  that  all  these  things  had  been  is  to \npredicted,  and  were   receiving  such  an   accom-  ig^efthen \nplishment,  through  the  arrangement  of  that  very \nperson  who  had  given  them  the  promises.     Just \nas  if  he  should  say,  I  am  delivering  you,  it  is  most \ntrue  ;  but  you  will  hardly  believe  it,  Pharaoh  will \nmake  such  a  resistance,  and  will  so  put  off  the \nevent.     But   trust   in  my   promises    not    a  whit \nthe  less  :  all  this  very  putting-off  of  his  will  be \neffected  by  my  workings,  that  I  may  perform  the \n\np  The  word  lenitas,  which  occurs  so  frequently  in  this  pas- \nsage, properly  denotes  c  softness/  c  gentleness/  '  kindness/  as \nopposed  to  '  roughness/  '  harshness/  '  severity  /  and  seems \nmost  aptly  to  express  that  c  forbearance/  or  '  indulgence/ \nwith  which  the  Lord  God  suffereth  long,  and  is  kind. \n\n\n280  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL; \n\npart  IV.  more  and  the  greater  miracles,  to  confirm  you  in \nyour  faith,  and  to  shew  my  power ;  that  you  may \nhereafter  place  the  greater  confidence  in  me  with \nrespect  to  all  other  things. — This  is  just  what \nChrist  also  does,  when  he  promises  the  kingdom \nto  his  disciples  at  the  last  supper  :  he  foretels \nvery  many  difficulties — his  own  death,  and  their \nmanifold  tribulations — that  when  the  event  should \nhave  taken  place,  they  might  hereafter  believe  in \nhim  much  more/1 \n\nIndeed,  Moses  sets  this  meaning  very  clearly \nbefore  us,  when  he  says,  \"  But  Pharaoh  shall\"  not \nlet  you  go,  that  many  signs  may  be  wrought  in \nEgypt/'  And  again  :  \"  To  this  end  have  I  stirred \nthee  up,  that  I  might  shew  in  thee  my  power,  and \nthat  my  name  might  be  declared  in  all  the  earth.\" \nYou  see  here,  that  Pharaoh  is  hardened  for  this \nvery  purpose,  that  he  may  resist  God,  and  may  put \noff  the  redemption  of  Israel ;  in  order  that  occa- \nsion may  be  made  for  shewing  many  signs,  and \nfor  declaring  the  power  of  God;  to  the  end,  that \nhe  may  be  spoken  of  and  believed  in,  throughout \nall  the  earth.  What  is  this  else,  but  that  all \nthese  things  are  spoken  and  done  to  confirm  faith, \nand  to  comfort  the  weak,  that  they  may  freely \ntrust  in  God  hereafter,  as  the  true,  the  faithful, \nthe  powerful  and  the  merciful  One?  As  if  he \nwould  say  to  his  little  ones  in  softest  words,  (  Be \nnot  terrified  by  Pharaoh's  hardness  of  heart ;  I \nam  the  worker  of  that  very  hardness  also,  and  I \nhold  it  in  my  own  hands ;  I  who  am  your  deliverer \nwill  use  it  with  no  other  effect,  than  that  it  shall \ncause  me  to  work  many  signs,  and  to    declare \n\n9  <(  Now  I  teH  you  before  it  come  (Judas  s  treachery),  that, \nwhen  it  is  come  to  pass,  ye  may  believe  that  I  am  He.\"  \"  And \nnow  I  have  told  you  before  it  come  to  pass  (his  going  to  the \nFather),  that,  when  it  is  come  to  pass,  ye  might  believe.\" \n\"  But  these  things  have  I  told  you  (their  own  persecutions), \nthat,  when  the  time  shall  come,  ye  may  remember  that  I  told \nyou  of  them.\" — (John  xiii.  19.  xiv.  29.  xvi.  4.) \n\nr  Exod.  vii.  4.  xi.  9. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  281 \n\nmy  greatness,  to  the  end  that  ye  may  believe  in  se.  xvii. \nme/3  \n\nHence  that  saying,  which  Moses  repeats  after \nnearly  every  plague,  \"  And  the  heart  of  Pharaoh- \nwas  hardened,  that  he  did  not  let  the  people  go, \nas  the  Lord  had  spoken.\"  What  is  this  saying, \nu  As  the  Lord  had  spoken/'  but  that  God  might \nbe  seen  to  be  true,  who  had  declared  beforehand \nthat  he  should  be  hardened?  If  there  had  been \nany  vertibility  here,  any  freeness  of  will  in  Pha- \nraoh, such  as  had  power  to  incline  towards  either \nside ;  God  could  not  with  such  certainty  have \nforetold  his  induration — but  since  the  Promiser \nhere  is  one  who  can  neither  be  mistaken,  nor  telJ \na  lie,  it  was  necessarily  and  most  assuredly  to \ncome  to  pass,  that  he  should  be  hardened  ;  and \nthis  could  not  be,  unless  the  induration  were  alto- \ngether without  the  limits  of  man's  power,  and \nstood  only  in  the  power  of  God :  just  as  I  have \ndescribed  it  above  ;  to  wit,  God  was  certain  that \nhe  should  not  omit  the  general  exercise  of  his \nomnipotency  in  the  person  of  Pharaoh,  or  because \nof  Pharaoh ;  seeing,  it  is  what  he  even  cannot \nomit. \n\nFurthermore,  he  was  equally  sure  that  the  will \nof  Pharaoh,  naturally  wicked  and  averse  from \nHim,  could  not  consent  to  the  word  and  work  of \nGod  winch  was  contrary  to  it ;  so  that,  whereas \n\ns  Luther  circumscribes  the  design.  Doubtless,  God  would \ncomfort  and  encourage  his  people  by  these  acts  and  predic- \ntions :  but  self-manifestation  was  His  one  ultimate  object ;  and \nin  order  to  this,  the  confounding,  and  the  rendering  yet  more \ninexcusable,  of  his  enemies,  as  well  as  the  emboldening  of  his \nbeloved  ones. — Was  there  not  also  a  manifestation  of  what \nhuman  nature  is,  hereby  made  in  his  own  people  ?  Did  they  all \nbelieve,  after  all  these  signs  ?  Whence  those  hankerings  after \nEgypt  ?  Whence  those,  \"  It  had  been  better  for  us  to  have \nserved  the  Egyptians  ?\" — The  whole  is  resolvable  into  that \ngreat  first  principle,  '  God  shewing  what  he  is,  by  his  dealings \nwith  the  human  nature  as  exhibited  both  in  the  elect  and  in \nthe  reprobate — in  his  friends  and  in  his  enemies.'

For,  if  God  had  omitted  the  acting \nof  his  omnipotency  in  Pharaoh  at  the  moment \nwhen  he  threw  the  contradictory  message  of \nMoses  into  his  path,  and  if  Pharaoh's  will  be \nsupposed  to  have  acted  itself  alone,  by  its  own \npower;  then  possibly  there  might  have  been \nground  for  questioning  to  which  of  the  two  sides \nit  would  have  inclined  itself.  But  now,  seeing \nthat  he  is  driven  and  hurried  along  to  an  act  of \nwilling — no  violence,  it  is  true,  being  done  to  his \nwill,  because  he  is  not  forced  against  his  will;  but \na  natural  operation  of  God  hurrying  him  away  to \na  natural  acting  of  his  will,  such  an  one  as  it  is, \nand  that  is  a  bad  one — it  follows  that  he  cannot \nbut  run  foulu  of  the  word,  and  by  so  doing  be \nhardened. — Thus,  we  see  that  this  text  fights \nmanfully  against  Freewill :  inasmuch  as  God  who \npromises  cannot  lie ;  and  if  he  does  not  lie,  Pha- \nraoh's heart  cannot  but  be  hardened. \n\nI  Occur su  objecta.']  It  is  contrived  that  this  word  and  work \nof  God  should  come  into  contact  with  the  edge  of  the  will \nexcited  into  action  by  omnipotency,  through  an  act  like  that  of \nthrowing  a  bone  to  a  dog,  or  casting  a  stumbling-block  in  the \npath  of  a  traveller. \n\nII  Imp'mgere.']  Imp.

He  seems  now  to  make  the  crisis  of  the \nevil  lie  there.  I  can  understand  that  there  might  be  inertness \nin  the  case  which  he  supposes  :  but  if  there  be  an  act  of  will, \nin  an  essentialhj  bad  will,  I  cannot  understand  how  it  should  be \nother  than  evil.  (See  above,  note  k.) — The  case  is  merely \nhypothetical,  put  for  the  sake  of  illustration  (but,  like  many \nother  intended  illustrations,  confusing  rather  than  distinguish- \ning the  object  on  which  it  would  shine),  and  impossible  :  for \nGod  acts  always,  and  therefore  actuates  the  wicked  always  -, \nthat  is,  keeps  them  in  their  place  and  state  as  moral  agents—* \nwhich  is  a  state  of  activity. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  283 \n\nBut  let  us  look  at  Paul  also,  who  adopts  this  se.xviii; \n\npassage  from  Moses  in  Rom.  ix.

One \nwhile  the  passages  adduced  from  Paul   do    not \noppose  Freewill,  because  they  do  not  speak  of  the \nsalvation  of  man.     One  while  the  foreknowledge \nof  God  presupposesx  necessity;  another  while  it \ndoes  not.     One  while  grace  prevents  the  will- \ncausing  it  to  will — accompanies  it  on   its  way, \nand  gives  the  happy  issue.     One  while  the  first \ncause  effects  every  thing;  another  while  it  acts \nby  second  causes,  itself  doing  nothing.     By  these \nand  such  like  mocking  words,  she  only  aims  to \nget  time,  and  to  snatch  the  cause  meanwhile  out  of \nour  sight,  and  drag  it  some  whither  else.     She \ngives  us  credit  for  being  as  stupid  and  heartless, \nor  as  little  interested  in  the  cause,  as  she  herself \nis.     Or  as  little  children,  when  frightened  or  at \nplay,  cover  their  eyes  with  their  hands,  and  think \nnobody   sees   them,    because   they   see   nobody; \neven  so  Diatribe,  not  being  able  to  bear  the  rays, \nor  rather  the  lightnings,  of  the  clearest  possible \nwords,  uses  all  sorts  of  pretences  to  make  it  ap- \npear that  she  does  not  see  the  real  truth;  that \nshe  may  persuade  us,  if  possible,  to  cover  our \neyes,  so  as  not  even  to  see  it  ourselves.

That \n\nfigment   of  the  necessity    of   a   consequence  as \n\ndiffering  from  the  necessity  of  a  consequent,  has \nbeen  confuted  already.  (Part  i.  Sect,  xi.)  Let \nDiatribe  invent  and  re-invent,  cavil  and  re-cavil, \nas  much  as  she  pleases,  if  God  foreknew  that \nJudas  would  be  a  traitor,  Judas  necessarily  be- \ncame a  traitor ;  nor  was  it  in  the  power  of  Judas, \nor  of  any  creature,  to  do  otherwise,  or  to  change \nhis  will,  though  he  did  what  he  did  by  an  act  of \nwilling,  and  not  by  compulsion.  But  to  will  that \nact  was  the  operation  of  a  substance  which  God \nput  into  motion  by  his  own  omnipotency,  as  he \nalso  does  every  thing  else.  For  it  stands  as  an \ninvincible  and  self-evident  proposition,  that  c  God \nneither  lies,  nor  is  mistaken.'  The  words  under \noar  consideration  are  not  obscure  or  doubtful \nwords,  although  all  the  learned  of  all  ages  may \nhave  been  blind,  so  as  to  understand  and  inter- \npret them  otherwise.  Prevaricate  as  much  as \nyou  may,  your  own  conscience,  and  that  of  all \nmen,  is  compelled  to  acknowledge,  if  God  be  not \nmistaken  in  that  which  he  foreknows,  the  very \nthing  foreknown  must  necessarily  take  place. \nElse  who  could  trust  his  promises,  who  would \nfear  his  threatenings,  if  what  he  promises  or \nthreatens  do  not  necessarily  follow?  or,  how \ncan  he  promise  or  threaten,  if  his  foreknowledge \ndeceives  him,  or  can  be  thwarted  by  our  muta- \nbility? This  excessive  light  of  undoubted  truth \nmanifestly  stops  every  mouth,  puts  an  end  to  all \nquestions,  and  decrees  a  victory  in  spite  of  all \nevasive  subtilties.  We  know  very  well  that  the \nforeknowledge  of  man  is  beguiled.  We  know \nthat  an  eclipse  does  not  happen  because  it  is \nforeknown,  but  is  foreknown  because  it  is  going \nto  happen.  But  what  have  we  to  do  with  this \nsort  of  foreknowledge  ?  we  are  arguing  about \nthe  foreknowledge  of  God.  Deny  to  this  the \nnecessity  of  the  thing  foreknown  being  effected, \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  385 \n\nand  you  take  away  the  faith  and  fear  of  God ;   sec.xix. \n\nyou  throw  down  all  God's  promises  and  threaten-  \n\nings;  nay,  you  deny  the  very  being  of  God. — \nBut  even  Diatribe  herself,  after  a  long  struggle, \nin  which  she  has  tried  all  her  arts,  is  at  length \ncompelled  by  the  force  of  truth  to  make  confession \nof  our  sentiment,  and  says; \n\n6  The  question  about  the  will  and  purpose  of  Diatribe's \nGod  is  a  more  difficult  one.     For  God  wills  the  sionsTnd \nsame   things  which  he  foreknows.     And  this  is  retractions \nwhat  Paul  subjoins;   \"  Who  resisteth  his  will,  if  exPosed' \nhe  pitieth  whom  he  will,  and  hardeneth  whom  he \nwill?\"     For  if  he  were  a  king,  he  would  do  what \nhe  liked,  so  that  no  one  should  be  able  to  resist \nhim;  he  would  be   said  to   do  what   he   would. \nThus  the  will  of  God,  as  being  the  principal  cause \nof  ail  events,  seems  to  impose  a  necessity  upon \nour  will/     This  is  what  she  says. \n\nAnd  I  thank  God  that  Diatribe  has  at  last \nrecovered  her  senses.  What  is  become  of  Free- \nwill now?  But  this  eel  slips  again  out  of  our \nhands,  by  saying  in  a  moment ; \n\n1  But  Paul  does  not  resolve  this  question ;  on \nthe  contrary,  he  chides  the  inquirer ;  nay,  but  O \nman,  who  art  thou  that  repliest  against  God?' \n\nO  exquisite  evasion  !

What  was  in  fact \nasked  in  this  question  concerning  the  will  of  God  ? \nWas  it  not  asked  whether  he  puts  a  necessity \nupon  our  will?

By  the  omnipotency  of \nGod,  I  mean  not  a  power  by  which  he  might  do  many \nthings  which  he  does  not;  but  that  acting  omni- \npotency, by  which  he  doeth  all  things,  with  power, \nin  all  things  :  it  is  after  this  manner,  that  the \nScripture  calls  him  omnipotent.

It  is  very \n\nprudent  in  you  doubtless,  after  having  conducted \n\nyour  cause  all  the  way  into  the  midst  of  a  crowded \ncourt8 — when  now  a  pleader  is  most  of  all  neces- \nsary— to  turn  your  back,  and  leave  the  business  of \nreplying  and  defining*  to  others.  You  should \nhave  acted  this  counsel  from  the  first,  and \nabstained  from  writing  altogether;  according  to \nthat  saying,  c  The  man  who  knows  not  how  to \ncontend  abstains  from  the  weapons  of  the  field/\" \nIt  was  not  expected  of  Erasmus,  that  he  should \nremove v  that  difficulty,  e  how  God  with  certainty \nforeknows,  yet  our  actions  are  contingent/  This \ndifficulty  was  in  the  world  long  before  Diatribe's \ntime.  But  it  was  expected  that  he  should  reply \nand  define.  However,  being  himself  a  rheto- \nrician, whilst  we  know  nothing  about  it,  he  calls \nin  a  rhetorical  transition  to  his  aid,  and — carrying \nus  ignoramuses  along  with  him,  as  if  the  matter \nin  debate  were  one  of  no  moment,  and  the  whole \ndiscussion  were  mere  quirk  and  quibble, — dashes \nviolently  out  of  the  midst  of  the  crowd,  wearing \nhis  crown  of  ivy  and  laurel.x \n\ns  The  '  mediae  turbas'  are  the  multitudes  surrounding  the \njudicial  tribunal  :  c  non  usitata  frequentid  stipati  sumus.' — Cic. \n'  Perduxeris  '  expresses  the  pomp  and  the  labour  with  which \nhe  had  dragged  on  the  cause  to  issue. \n\nt  Respondendi  et  definiendi.']  Resp.  has  respect  to  the  adver- \nsary's argument,  which  should  be  invalidated  or  taken  off: \ndefin.  is  the  explanatory  statement  of  the  advocate's  own  case. \nSee  above,  Part  i.

In \nmany  sorts  of  competition,  and  for  many  sorts  of  merit,  it  was \ncustomary  to  crown  the  conquerors  with  various  materials — \nsometimes  precious,  sometimes  of  no  value — as  the  highest \ntribute  of  honour  which  could  be  received.

There  is  no  skill  in  rhetoric  XXIIL \nso  great  as  to  be  able  to  deceive  a  sincere  con- \nscience: the  sting  of  conscience  is  mightier  than \neloquence  with  all  her  powers  and  figures.  We \nshall  not  suffer  the  rhetorician  to  pass  on  here  to \nanother  topic,  that  he  may  hide  himself:  it  is  not \nthe  place  for  this  exhibition.  The  hiuge  of  the \nseveral  matters  in  dispute,  and  the  head  of  the \ncause  is  attacked  here:  it  is  here  that  Freewill \nis  either  extinguished,  or  shall  gain  a  complete \ntriumph.  But  instead  of  meeting  this  crisis,  no \nsooner  do  you  perceive  your  danger,  or  rather \nperceive  that  the  victory  over  Freewill  is  sure ; \nthan  you  pretend  to  see  nothing  but  metaphysical \nsubtilties  in  the  question.  Is  this  acting  the  part \nof  a  trusty  theologian?  Are  you  serious  in  the \ncause  ?  How  comes  it  then,  that  you  both  leave \nyour  hearers  in  suspense,  and  the  discussion  in  a \nstate  of  confusion  and  exasperation/  Still  how- \never, you  would  be  thought  to  have  done  your \nwork  very  honourably,  and  would  seem  to  have \ncarried  off  the  palm.  Such  cunning  and  wili- \nnessz  may  be  endurable  in  profane  causes;  but  in \ntheology,  where  simple  and  undisguised  truth  is \nthe  object  of  pursuit — that  souls  may  be  saved — \nit  is  most  hateful  and  intolerable. \n\nThe  Sophists  also  have  felt  the  invincible  and  Much  joy \ninsupportable  force  of  this  argument ;  and  have  ^hlstl  and \ntherefore    feigned   this   distinction  between    the  Diatribe  in \n\nBacchus,  and  an  unrivalled  Apollo,  by  wearing  the  emblems \nof  those  divinities. \n\ny  Perturbatum  et  exasperatum.~\\  Perturb,  implies  want  of  order \nand  distinctness ;  no  first,  second,  and  third,  either  in  reply \nor  advancement  :  exasp.  the  heat  and  ruffle  with  which  it  is \nmaintained  $  we  speak  of  f  angry'  debate. \n\nz  Vafritia  et  versutia.']  Vaf.  expresses  the  subtile  invention \nwhich  devises  ;  versut.  the  versatility  and  adroitness  with  which \nthe  crafty  counsel  is  executed  :  opposed  afterwards  by  simplex, \nf  what  is  inartificial  y  and  aperta,   (  what  is  manifest  to  the \n\n\n298  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  necessity  of  a  consequence  and  of  a  consequent : \n\n«-* but  how   fruitless   this   distinction  is,   has  been \n\ntheir  ne-  snewn  already.*  They  also,  like  yourself,  are  not \nTconse-  aware  what  they  say,  and  how  much  they  admit \nquent.  against  themselves.

The  necessity \nof  the  consequence  effects  this ;  if  God  foreknows \nan  event,  that  very  event  necessarily  happens. \nIn  other  words,  Freewill  is  a  nothing.  This \nnecessity  of  the  consequence  is  neither  ob- \nscure, nor  ambiguous  :  if  the  great  doctors  in  all \nages  have  even  been  blind,  they  must  still  be \nobliged  to  admit  its  existence,  since  it  is  so  mani- \nfest and  so  certain  as  to  be  palpable. b \n\nBut  the  necessity  of  the  consequent,  with  which \nthey  comfort  themselves,  is  a  mere  phantom,  and \nfights,  as  the  saying  is,  diametrically  with  the  ne- \ncessity of  the  consequence.

Let  us \n\nnow  examine  the  second,  about  Jacob  and  Esau ; \nof  whom,  when  not  yet  born,  it  was  said  \"  The \nelder  shall  serve  the  younger.\"  Diatribe  evades \nthis  passage  by  saying,  c  It  has  nothing  properly \nto  do  with  the  subject  of  man's  salvation.  God \nmay  will  that  a  man  be  a  servant  or  a  poor  man, \nwhether  the  man  will  or  no,  without  his  being \nrejected  from  eternal  salvation/ \nNothing  See  how  many  side-paths  and  holes  of  escape  a \n\nsalvation,  slippery  mind  seeks  after,  which  is  intent  upon \nSo' Jerome  flying  away  from  truth;  but  still  she  does  not \nhad  said.  qUite  accomplish  her  flight.  Let  us  suppose,  if \nyou  will,  that  this  text  does  not  appertain  to \nman's  salvation  (of  which  I  shall  speak  hereafter), \nis  it  to  no  purpose  then,  that  Paul  adduces  it? \nShall  we  make  Paul  ridiculous,  or  absurd,  in  the \nmidst  of  so  serious  a  discussion  ?  Howbeit,  this  is  a \nfancy  of  Jerome's;  who,  with  abundant  arrogance \non  his  brow,  whilst  he  is  committing  sacrilege \nwith  his  mouth,  has  the  audacity  in  more  places \nthan  one  to  affirm,  that  those  Scriptures  which \noppose  in  Paul,  do  not  oppose  in  their  proper \nplaces,0  from  which  he  quotes  them.  What  is  this \nbut  to  say,  that,  in  laying  the  foundations  of \nchristian  doctrine,  Paul  does  but  corrupt  the \ndivine  Scriptures,  and  beguile  the  souls  of  the \nfaithful,  by  a  sentiment  which  is  the  coinage  of \nhis  own  brain,  and  which  is  intruded  upon  the \nScriptures  by  violence  ?  Such  is  the  honour, \nwhich  the  Spirit  ought  to  receive,  in  the  person  of \nthat  holy  and  choice  instrument  of  God,  Paul ! \nNow,  whereas  Jerome  ought  to  be  read  with \njudgment,   and   this   saying  of  his  to  be  classed \n\nmitted  by  the  way  :   such  as  the  state  of  man,  limits  of  inquiry, \ncarnal  reason's  objections,  &c. .  . . \n\ne  Pugnant.~\\  Said  with  reference  to  some  particular  doctrine \nnot  named — the  doctrine  of  Freewill  doubtless,  as  maintained \nby  Jerome  and  those  who  teach  like  him. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  301 \n\namongst  the  many  which  that  gentleman  (through  sect. \nhis  listlessness  in  studying,  and  his  d illness  in  XXY' \nunderstanding  Scripture)  has  written  impiously; \nDiatribe  snaps  up  this  very  saying  without \nany  judgment,  and  does  not  deign  to  mitigate \nit,  as  she  might  at  least  do,  with  a  gloss  of  some \nsort,  but  both  judges  and  qualifies  the  Scriptures \nby  this  saying,  as  an  oracle  which  precludes  all \ndoubt.  Thus  it  is,  that  we  take  the  ungodly  say- \nings of  men  as  so  many  rules  and  measures  for \ninterpreting  the  divine  word:  and  can  we  any \nlonger  wonder  that  it  has  become  ambiguous  and \nobscure,  and  that  so  many  of  the  Fathers  are \nblind  to  its  real  meaning,  when  it  is  thus  made \nimpious  and  profane  ? \n\nLet  him  be  anathema  therefore  who  shall  say,  paui  de- \n*  those  words  do  not  oppose  the  doctrine  in  their  fended  in \noriginal  places,  which  do  oppose  as  quoted  by  gL?xxv. \nPaul/     This  is  said,  but  not  proved  ;  and  is  said  21—23. \nby  those,  who  neither  understand  Paul  nor  the  ^edfy \npassages  cited  by  him,  but  deceive  themselves  by  supposing \ntaking  the  words  in  their  own  sense ;  that  is,  an  the  service \nimpious  one.    For  although  this  text  in  particular \n(Gen.  xxv.  21 — 23.)  were  meant  of  temporal  ser- \nvitude1 only  (which  is  not  true);  still  it  is  rightly \nand  efficaciously  quoted  by  Paul  to  prove,  that, \nnot  for  the  merits  of  Jacob  or  of  Esau,  but  through \nhim  that  calleth,   it   was  said  to    Sarah8  \"  The \n\nf  What  is,  in  fact,  gained  by  this  distinction  ?

And  the  Lord  said  unto  her.\"  Gen.  xxv.  22,  23. \nThe  preceding  mention  of  Sarah  in  Rom.  ix.  accounts  for  the \nmistake. \n\n\n302  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  elder  shall  serve  the  younger.\" — Paul's  question \n\nis,  whether  they  attained  to  what  is  said  of  them \n\nby  the  virtue  or  merits  of  Freewill •  and  he \nproves  that,  not  by  the  virtue  or  merits  of  Free- \nwill, but  only  by  the  grace  of  him  that  called \nhim,  Jacob  attained  to  what  Esau  did  not.  This \nhe  proves  by  invincible  words  of  Scripture :  such \nas,  that  they  were  not  yet  born ;  and  again,  that \nthey  had  done  neither  good  nor  evil.  The  weight \nof  the  matter  lies  in  this  proof ;  this  is  the  point \nunder  debate.  But  Diatribe,  through  her  ex- \nquisite skill  in  rhetoric,  passing  over  and  dis- \nguising all  these  things,  does  not  at  all  debate  the \nquestion  of  merits  (although  she  had  undertaken \nto  do  so,  and  although  Paul's  handling  of  the \nsubject  requires  it),  but  quibbles  about  tem- \nporal servitude  (as  if  this  were  any  thing  to \nthe  purpose) ;  only  that  she  may  appear  not  to \nbe  conquered  by  those  most  mighty  words  of \nPaul.  For  what  could  she  have  to  yelp  out \nagainst  Paul,  in  support  of  Freewill  ?  what \nprofit  was  there  of  Freewill  to  Jacob  ?  what \nhurt  of  the  same  to  Esau  ?  when  it  had  been \nsettled  by  the  foreknowledge  and  ordination  of \nGod  what  sort  of  a  lot  each  of  them  should  re- \nceive :  namely,  that  the  one  should  serve,  and  the \nother  should  rule ;  when  as  yet  neither  of  them \nwas  born,  or  had  done  any  thing.  The  rewards, \nwhich  each  shall  receive,  are  decreed  before  the \nworkmen  are  born,  and  have  begun  to  work.  It \nis  to  this  point,  that  Diatribe  ought  to  have \ndirected  her  reply.  This  is  what  Paul  insists \nupon,  that  they  had  done  nothing  good  or  evil \nas  yet,*  but  still  the  one  is  ordained  to  be  the \nmaster  and  the  other  the  servant,  by  a  divine  judg- \nment. The  question  is  not,  whether  this  ser- \nvitude have  respect  to  eternal  salvation,  but  by \nwhat  merit  this  servitude  is  imposed  upon  a  man \nwho  has  not  merited  any  thing.     But  it  is  most \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  303 \n\nirksome  to  maintain  a  conflict  with  these  depraved11     SECT, \nendeavours  to  torture  and  elude  Scripture. \n\n\nHowbeit,  that  Moses  is  not  treating  of  their  Theservice \ntemporal  servitude  and  dominion  only,  and  that  is  not \nPaul  is  right  in  this  also,  that  he  understands  him  ^fbut*\" \nto  speak  with  reference  to  their  eternal  salvation  spiritual, \n(although  this  be  not  so  important  to  the  point  in \nhand,  I  will  not  however  suffer  Paul  to  be  defiled \nwith  the  calumnies  of  sacrilegious  men1),  is \nproved  from  the  text  itself.  The  divine  answer  k \ngiven  to  Rebekah  in  the  book  of  Moses  is,  \"  Two \nmanner  of  people  shall  be  separated  from  thy \nwomb  ;  and  the  one  people  shall  overcome \nthe  other  people,  and  the  elder  shall  serve  the \nyounger.\"  Here  two  sorts  of  people  are  mani- \nfestly distinguished  from  each  other.  The  one \nis  received  into  the  free  favour  of  God,  although \nthe  younger,  so  as  to  overcome  the  elder ;  not  by \nstrength,  it  is  true,  but  through  God's  befriending \nhim.

The  question  is  about  the  difference \nbetween  Jacob  and  Esau.  Both  alike  fallen  and  self-destroyed \nin  Adam,  the  question  is  how  either  of  these  receives  dis- \ntinguishing benefits,  whether  of  a  temporal  or  eternal  nature. \nWith  respect  to  manifest  existence  and  distinct  personal \nagency,  neither  of  them,  it  is  plain,  had  done  good  or  evil, \nwhen  the  words  were  spoken  to  Rebekah.  That  which  alone \ncould  constitute  any  difference  on  a  ground  of  Freewill  or \nmerit,  there  had  as  yet  been  no  opportunity  of  displaying-. \n\n1  See  last  section.  The  question  of  Freewill  is  not  affected. \nErasmus  follows  Jerome,  whom  Luther  has  pronounced  sacri- \nlegious. \n\nk  OraculumJ]  It  is  said  of  Rebekah,  that  cc  she  went  to  in- \nquire of  the  Lord.\"  Oraculum  therefore,  c  an  answer,  counsel, \nor  sentence  from  the  Gods,'  is  the  fit  term  by  which  to  charac- \nterise what  was  said  to  her. \n\n\n304  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  IV.  God,1  it  is  not   only  external   dominion  or   ser- \n\n-^ vitude,  that  is  treated  of  here,  but  every  thing \n\nwhich  appertaineth  to  the  people  of  God ;  that \nis,  the  blessing  of  God,  the  word,  the  Spirit,  the \npromise  of  Christ,  and  the  eternal  kingdom : \nwhich  is  even  yet  more  largely  confirmed  by  the \nScripture  afterwards,  where  it  describes  Jacob \nas  being  blessed,  and  as  receiving  the  promises \nand  the  kingdom.  Paul  intimates  these  several \nthings  briefly,  when  he  says,  \"  the  elder  shall \nserve  the  younger i\"  sending  us  back  to  Moses, \nas  one  who  treats  them  more  at  large.  So  that, \nin  opposition  to  the  sacrilegious\"'  comment  of \nJerome  and  Diatribe,  you  may  say,  that  all  the \npassages  which  Paul  adduces  fight  yet  more \nstoutly  against  Freewill  in  their  original  places, \nthan  in  his  writings.  A  remark  which  holds \ngood,  not  only  with  respect  to  Paul,  but  with  re- \nspect to  all  the  Apostles ;  who  quote  the  Scrip- \ntures as  witnesses  to,  and  assertors  of  their  doc- \ntrine. Would  not  it  be  ridiculous  to  quote  as  a \ntestimony,  that  which  testifies  nothing,  and  does \nnot  bear  upon  the  question  ?

Is  it  not  made  the  ques- \ntion, how  God  loves  and  hates ;  instead  of  why \nhe  loves  and  hates  ?  By  what  merit  of  ours  he \nloves  or  hates,  is  the  question.  We  know  very \nwell,  that  God  does  not  hate  or  love,  as  we  do ; \nsince  we  both  love  and  hate  mutably;  but  he \nloves  and  hates  according  to  his  eternal  and  im- \nmutable nature :  so  far  is  he  from  being  the  sub- \nject of  accident  and  affection.  And  it  is  this  very \nthing  which  compels  Freewill  to  be  a  mere  no- \nthing ;  namely,  that  the  love  of  God  towards  men \nis  eternal  and  immutable,  and  his  hatred  towards \nthem  eternal ;  not  only  prior  to  the  merit  and \noperation  of  Freewill,  but  even  to  the  very  mak- \ning of  the  world;  and  that  every  thing  is  wrought \nin  us  necessarily,  according  to  his  having  either \nloved  us  or  not  loved  us,  from  eternity:  insomuch \nthat  not  only  the  love  of  God,  but  even  his  manner \nof  loving,    brings  necessity  upon  us. — See  here \n\nn  Qui  sacris  scripturis  serib  non  qfficiuntur.\"]  Luther  has  a \npeculiar  use  of  the  word  officio,  or  rather  afficior,  which  I  recog- \nnise here — c  affected  to'  —  denoting  a  mind  interested  in, \nhaving  its  affections  excited  towards  an  object. \n\n°  Triplici  industrid  torquet.~\\  A  peculiar  use  of  the  word \nindustrid — which  commonly  denotes  c  a  state,  or  act,  of  mind' — \nto  express  (  the  result  of  that  act ; '  and  this  in  an  unfavour- \nable sense  :  f  a  laboured  excogitation,  in  which  there  is  neither \ngenius,  nor  the  Spirit.'

Will  you \nalso  say  here,  God  doth  not  will  as  we  do ;  neither \nis  he  subject  to  the  affection  of  willing  ?  If  these \neffects  take  place  then,  they  take  place  only  when \nhe  wills  :  and  what  he  wills,  that  he  either  loves \nor  hates.  Tell  me  then,  by  what  merit  on  their \npart  severally,  Jacob  is  loved  and  Esau  is  hated \nbefore  they  are  born  and  perform  any  act?  It \nappears  therefore,  that  Paul  doth  most  excellently \nintroduce  Malachi  to  support  the  sentiment  of \nMoses  (namely,  that  God  called  Jacob  before  he \nwas  born,  because  he  loved  him,  and  not  because \nhe  was  loved  before  by  Jacob,  or  because  he  was \nmoved  by  any  merit  of  his  to  do  so);  that  it  might \nbe  shewn  in  the  case  of  Jacob  and  Esau,  what \nour  Freewill  can  do.r \n\nThe  second  of  these  laboured  excogitations  is, \n'that  Malachi  seems  not  to  be  speaking  of  the \nhatred  by  which  we  are  eternally  damned,  but  of \na  temporary  affliction.  It  is  a  reprehension  of \nthose  who  would  build  up  Eclom.' \n\nHere  is  a  second  word  of  reproach  for  Paul, \nas  doing  violence  to  Scripture  :  so  entirely  do  we \ncast  off  our  reverence  for  the  majesty  of  the  Holy \nSpirit,  if  we  may  but  establish  our  own  conclu- \n\n\nSECT. \nXXVIII. \n\nMalachi \nspeaks  of \ntemporal \naffliction. \n\n\n9  Citra  et prater.]  More  literally,,  f  on  this  side  and  beyond  :' \nimplying  therefore  that  they  are  altogether  of  him  and  through \nhim.  and  to  him. \n\nr  Erasmus  says  it  is  not  love  and  hate,  but  the  effect  of  these. \nLuther  replies,  if  effect,  it  is  God's  will  that  effects,  and  the \neffect  is  what  he  approves  :  he  approves  one  sort  of  event  to \nJacob  therefore,  and  another  to  Esau.— How  much  forwarder \nare  you  ? \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  307 \n\nsions.

What  comes  of  this  ?  or \nwhat  is  this  to  the  point  in  hand  ?  Paul  is  prov- \ning from  Malachi  that  this  affliction  was  brought \nupon  Esau  without  any  merit  of  his,  by  the  mere \nhatred  of  God  ;  that  he  may  conclude  Freewill  to \nbe  nothing.  Here  it  is  you  are  pressed  :  to  this \npoint  you  ought  to  direct  3^0 ur  answer.  We  are \ndisputing  about  merit,  you  speak  of  reward ;  and \nin  such  a  way  as  not  however  to  elude  what  you \nwas  meaning  to  elude  :  nay,  in  even  speaking  of \nreward  you  acknowledge  merit.5  But  you  pre- \ntend that  you  do  not  see  this.  Tell  me  then,  what \nwas  the  cause  in  the  divine  mind  for  loving  Jacob \nand  hating  Esau,  when  they  were  not  yet  in \nbeing. — Again ;  it  is  false,  that  Malachi  speaks \nonly  of  temporary  affliction ;  nor  is  his  business \nwith  the  destruction  of  Edom  :  you  pervert  the \nwhole  meaning  of  the  Prophet  by  this  laboured \nsubtilty.  The  Prophet  makes  it  quite  plain  what \nhe  means,  by  using  the  clearest  terms  :  his  mean- \ning is  to  upbraid  the  Israelites  with  their  ingra- \ntitude, because,  whilst  he  has  been  loving  them, \nthey  in  return  are  neither  loving  him  as  a  father, \nnor  fearing  him  as  a  master.  The  fact  of  his \nhaving  loved  them  he  proves  both  by  Scripture \nand  by  actual  performance.  For  instance,  although \nJacob  and  Esau  were  brothers,  as  Moses  writes \nin  Gen.  xxv.  he  had  however  loved  and  chosen \nJacob  before  he  was  born  (as  we  have  just  shewn), \n\ns  To  make  this  text  consist  with  Freewill,  there  must  be \nground  of  love  and  of  hate  in  the  personal  mind  and  conduct  of \nthe  two  persons. — What  follows  is  a  master's  view  of  Malachi's \nprophecy,  and  decisive  as  to  the  question.  Judah's  reproach  is \nthat  he  has  been  freely,  distinguishing^  loved,  and  has  been \nso  treacherous.  The  essence  of  the  reproach  is  the  freeness  of \nthe  love  :  and  what  is  this  temporality,  which  extends  from \ngeneration  to  generation,  and  which  comprehends  as  its  cen- \ntral portion  '  the  eternal  God  had/  in  opposition  to  '  not  Jiad, \nbut  had  for  an  enemy  }\\ \n\nx2 \n\n\n»08  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\nART  iv.  but  had  so  hated  Esau  as  to  have  reduced  his \n\ncountry  to    a   wilderness.     Moreover   he   hates, \n\nand  persists  in  hating,  with  such  pertinacity,  that, \nafter  having  brought  Jacob  back  from  captivity \nand  restored  him,  still  he  suffered  not  the  Eclom- \nites  to  be  restored ;  but,  even  if  they  should  say \nthey  would  build,  himself  threatens  them  with \ndestruction.  If  the  Prophet's  own  plain  text1 \ndoes  not  contain  these  things,  let  the  whole  world \ncharge  me  with  telling  a  lie.  It  is  not  the  teme- \nrity of  the  Edomites  then,  which  is  reprehended \nhere,  but  the  ingratitude  (as  I  have  said)  of  the \nsons  of  Jacob  ;  who  do  not  see  what  he  is  con- \nferring upon  them,  and  what  he  is  taking  away \nfrom  their  brothers  the  Edomites,  for  no  reason \nbut  because  he  hates  the  one,  and  loves  the \nother. u \n\nHow  will  it  now  stand  good,  that  the  Prophet \nis  speaking  of  temporary  affliction  ?  when  he  de- \nclares in  plain  terms,  that  he  is  speaking  about \ntwo  distinct  nations  of  people,  who  had  descended \nfrom  the  two  Patriarchs  :  that  the  one  of  these \nhad  been  taken  up  to  be  his  people,  and  had  been \npreserved ;  the  other  had  been  abandoned,  and \nat  length  destroyed.  Now  the  act  of  taking  up \na  people  as  a  people,  and  not  taking  them  up  as \nsuch,  has  not  respect  to  temporal  good  or  evil \nonly,  but  to  every  thing.  For  our  God  is  not  the \nGod  of  our  temporal  possessions  only,  but  of \nevery  thing  we  have  and  look  for :  nor  will  he \nchoose  to  be  your  God,  or  to  be  worshipped  by \nyou,  with  half  a  shoulder,  or  a  limping  foot,  but \nwith  all  your  strength  and  with  all  your  heart ;  so \nas  to  be  your  God  both  here  and  hereafter,  in  all \ncircumstances,  cases,  times,  and  works. \n\n1  Textusipse  apertus  Prophetce.~\\  Ipse,  without  any  additions \nof  mine ;  apertus,  what  requires  no  opening  to  make  its  mean- \ning clear. \n\nu  Hie  odit,  illic  amat.~\\  More  literally,  '  hates  in  the  one \nquarter,  and  loves  in  the  other. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  309 \n\nThe  third  of  these  elaborate  excogitations  is.,  sc.xxtx. \n\n'By  a  tropological  form  of  expression,  he  declares  \n\nthat  he  neither  loves  all  the  Gentiles  nor  hates  all  £acob  and \n\n_  Jbsau  are  a \n\nthe  Jews;  but  some  out  of  each.  By  this  tro-  trope  for \npical  interpretation  it  is  made  out,  says  she,  that  Jewsand \nthis  testimony  has  no  voice  for  proving  neces- \nsity, but  for  repelling  the  arrogance  of  the  Jews. \nHaving  made  this  way  of  escape  for  herself,  she \nnext  goes  out  by  it  to  the  length  of  maintaining, \nthat  God  is  said  to  hate  those  who  are  not  yet \nborn,  inasmuch  as  he  knows  beforehand  that  they \nwill  do  things  worthy  of  hatred.  Thus  the  hatred \nand  love  of  God  are  no  obstacle  to  Freewill.  She \ncomes  at  last  to  the  conclusion,  that  the  Jews \nhave  been  cut  off  from  the  olive  tree  by  the  merit \nof  unbelief;  that  the  Gentiles  have  been  graffed \ninto  it  by  the  merit  of  faith — making  Paul  the \nauthor  of  this  sentiment — and  gives  hope  to  them \nthat  have  been  cut  off,  that  they  shall  again  be \ngraffed  in;  and  fear  to  them  that  have  been \ngraffed  in,  lest  they  should  be  cut  off/ \n\nLet  me  die,  if  Diatribe  knows  herself  what  she \nis  saying.  But  perhaps  there  is  here  also  some \nrhetorical  figure,  which  teaches  scholars  to  obscure \nthe  sense,  wherever  there  is  any  danger  of  being \nentrapped  by  the  word.  I  see  none  of  those \ntropical  forms  of  speech  here,  which  Diatribe \nimagines  to  herself  in  her  dreams,  but  does  not \nprove :  no  wonder  then,  that  the  testimony  of \nMalachi  does  not  oppose  her,  if  taken  in  a \ntropological  sense;  when  it  has  no  such  sense  at \nall.  Again ;  our  subject  of  disputation  is  not \nthat  cutting  off  and  graffing  in  of  which  Paul \nspeaks  afterwards/  when  he  exhorts.     We  know \n\nv  I  insert  the  word  e  afterwards '  to  give  clearness.  It  is \nevidently  the  eleventh  chapter  to  which  he  refers. — There  can- \nnot be  a  more  pernicious  practice  in  the  interpretation  of  Scrip- \nture (whilst  there  is  scarcely  any  more  common),  than  that  of \ndragging  in  words  which  are  somewhere  thereabouts,  but  do  really \nstand  in  quite  a  different  connection,  and  have  a  perfectly  dif- \n\n\n310 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n\npart  iv.  that  men  are  graffed  in  by  faith,  and  are  cut  off \n\n■  by  unbelief,  and  that  they  are  to  be  exhorted  to \n\nbelieve,  that  they  may  not  be  cut  off.  But  it  does \nnot  follow  from  hence,  neither  is  it  proved,  that \nthey  can  believe  or  disbelieve  through  the  power \nof  the  free  will :  which  free  will  is  the  subject  of \nour  debate.  We  are  not  discussing  who  are \nbelievers  and  who  not ;  who  are  Jews  and  who \nare  heathens ;  what  follows  to  believers  and  to \nunbelievers ;  all  this  belongs  to  the  exhorter. \nOur  question  is,  by  what  merit,  by  what  work, \nmen  attain  to  that  faith  by  which  they  are  graffed \nin ;  or  to  that  unbelief  by  which  they  are  cut  off. \nThis  is  what  belongs  to  the  teacher.x  Describe \nthis  merit  to  us.  Paul  teaches  that  this  befals, \nnot  by  any  work  of  ours,  but  only  by  the  love \nand  hatred  of  God:  and,  when  it  has  befallen  men \nto  believe,  exhorts  them  to  perseverance,  that \nthey  may  not  be  cut  off.  Still,  exhortation  proves \nnot  what  we  can  do,  but  what  we  ought  to  do. \nI  am  forced  to  use  almost  more  words  in  with- \nholding my  adversary  from  wandering  else  whi- \nther and  leaving  his  cause,  than  in  pleading  the \ncause  itself:  howbeit,  to  have  kept  him  to  the \npoint  is  to  have  conquered  him ;  so  clear  and  in- \nvincible are  the  words  which  we  have  under  con- \nsideration. Hence  it  is,  that  he  does  almost \nnothing  else  but  turn  aside  from  it,  hurry  away \nin  an  instant  out  of  sight,  and  plead  another \ncause  than  that  which  he  had  taken  in  hand. \nShe  takes  her  third  passage  from  Isaiah  xlv. \nDoth  the  clay  say  to  its  potter,   what  makest \n\n\nsc.  xxx. \n\n\nThe  simile \nof  clay  in \n\n\nferent  scope  ;  to  ascertain  the  meaning  of  a  proposed  text.  An \nargument,  or  rather  an  illustrative  exhortation  of  the  eleventh \nchapter,  separated  from  the  preceding  by  many  intervening \nsubjects  of  discussion,  is  adduced  by  Erasmus  to  determine \nthe  meaning  of  an  express  affirmation  in  the  early  part  of \nthe  ninth. \n\nx  According  to  Paul's  distinction  of  offices  in  Rom.  xii.  6 — 8. \n\"  Having  then  gifts,  &c. ;  or  he  that  teacheth,  on  teaching  5 \nor  he  that  exhorteth  on  exhortation.\" \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  311 \n\nthou?\"  And  from  Jeremiah  xviii.  \"As  the  clay  is  sc.  xxx. \n\nin  the  hand  of  the  potter,  so  are  ye  in  my  hand.\"  \n\n'  These  words,  again,  are  much  stronger  combatants  ^j^o* \nin   Paul,    she   says,   than   in  the  Prophets  from  ter,  Paul \nwhence   they   are  taken;    in   the  Prophets   they  doesnot \nare  spoken  of  temporal  affliction,  but  Paul  applies  Temporal \nthem  to  eternal  election  and  reprobation 9 — giving  afflictions \nPaul    a   black-eye   for  his   temerity,  or   for   his  evaders \nignorance.  force. \n\nBut,  before  we  see  how  she  proves  that  neither \nof  these  passages  exclude  Freewill,  let  me  first \nobserve,  that  Paul  does  not  appear  to  have  taken \nthis  passage  from  the  Prophets,  nor  does  Diatribe \nprove  that  he  has.     Paul  is  wont  to  bring  in  the \nname  of  the  writer,  or  to  protest  that  he  takes  his \nsentiment  from  the  Scriptures  :  neither  of  which \nhe  does  here.     It  is  therefore  more  probable  that \nPaul   uses   this   general   simile    (which   different \nwriters   adopt    for    the    illustration   of  different \ncauses),  in  a  sense  of  his  own,  for  the  illustration \nof  the  cause  which  he  has  in  hand.     Just  as  he \ndoes  with  that  simile,  u  A  little  leaven  corrupteth \nthe  whole  lump  f  which,  in  1  Cor.  v.,  he  adapts \nto  corruptive  manners,  and  elsewhere  casts  in  the \nteeth  of  those  who  were  corrupting  the  word  of \nGod :  just  as  Christ  also  makes  mention  of  the \nleaven  of  Herod  and  of  the  Pharisees.     So  then, \nalthough  the  Prophets  may  speak  especially  of \ntemporal  affliction  (a  point  which  I  decline  speak- \ning to  now,  that  I  may  not  be  so  often  occupied \nand  put  off  with  questions  foreign  to  the  subject); \nstill  Paul  uses  it  in  a  sense  of  his  own,  against \nFreewill.     But,  how  far  it  is  shewn  that  Freewill* \nis  not  taken  away,  if  we  be  clay  to  the  afflicting \nhand  of  God ;  or  why  Diatribe  insists  upon  this \ndistinction;  I  know  not:  since  it  is  unquestion- \nable, that  afflictions  come  upon  us  from  God  against \nour  own  will,  and  put  us  under  the  necessity  of \nbearing  them,  whether  we  will  or  no,  nor  have \nwe  it  in  our  own  power  to  avert  them ;  although \n\n\n312 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

She  objects  two  absurdities;  one  of  which \nshe  gathers  from  Scripture,  the  other  from  reason. \nThe  Scriptural  one  runs  thus. \n\nWhen  Paul  had  said  in  2  Tim.  ii.  that  in  a \ngreat  house  there  are  vessels  of  gold  and  of  sil- \nver and  of  wood  and  of  earth ;  some  for  honour, \nand  some  for  dishonour;  he  presently  adds,  \"if  a \nman  shall  have  cleansed  himself  from  these  he \nshall  be  a  vessel  unto  honour,  &c.\"  Upon  this, \nDiatribe  reasons  thus :  '  What  could  be  more \nfoolish  than  if  a  man  should  say  to  an  earthen \nurinal,  if  thou  shalt  have  purged  thyself,  thou \nshalt  be  a  vessel  of  honour?  which  however  would \nbe  rightly  enough  said  to  a  cask  possessed  of \nreason,  which  has  the  faculty  of  accommodating \nitself  to  the  will  of  its  master,  when  admonished \nwhat  that  will  is/  From  these  hints  she  would \ncollect  that  the  simile  does  not  square  in  all \nrespects,  and  is  so  far  parried,  as  to  prove  no- \nthing. I  answer,  first,  to  the  exclusion  of  this \ncavil,  that  Paul  does  not  say,  if  a  man  shall  have \ncleansed  himself  from  his  own  filth,  but  from \nthese;  that  is,  from  the  vessels  of  reproach :  so \nthat  the  sense  is,  if  a  man  shall  abide  in  a  state \nof  separation  from  these  ungodly  teachers,  and \nshall  not  have  mixed  himself  with  them,  he  shall \nbe  a  vessel  of  honour,  &c.

You  do  not  disprove  bond-will  by  this \ndistinction,  if  it  be  just :  rather,  you  adduce  an  instance  of \nbond-will.  These  afflictions  come,  lie,  remain  against  our \nwill.  How  much  does  this  shew  of  freedom  ? — Voluntarie. \nWe  are  taught  indeed  to  make  God's  pleasure  ours;  but, \nwhether  we  be  enabled  to  do  so,  or  not,  his  pleasure  only  is \ndone. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  313 \n\nefficacy  than  Diatribe  wishes  to  give  to  it ;  that  sc.xxxi. \nis,  that  the  simile  proves  nothing?  how  will  she \nprove  that  Paul  means  just  the  same  thing  in  that \npassage  from  Rom.  ix.  which  we  are  discussing? \nIs  it  enough,  to  quote  another  passage,  and  to \nhave  no  care  at  all  whether  it  have  the  same \nscope  or  a  different  one  ?  There  is  not  any  easier \nor  commoner  failure  in  the  interpretation  of  Scrip- \nture, as  I  have  often  shewn,  than  that  of  paral- \nlelizing different  passages  of  Scripture,  as  being \nalike;2  so  that  similitude  of  texts  (on  the  ground \nof  which  Diatribe  here  vaunts  herself)  is  even \nmore  inefficacious  than  this  simile  of  ours  which \nshe  is  confuting.  But,  not  to  be  contentious,  let \nme  grant  that  each  of  these  passages  in  PauPs \nwritings  means  the  same  thing  :  and  that  a  simile \n(which  without  controversy  is  true)  does  not \nalways,  and  in  all  particulars,  square  with  the \nthing  illustrated.  Indeed,  if  it  did,  it  would  be \nneither  simile  nor  metaphor,  but  the  very  thing \nitself;  according  to  the  proverb,  '  Simile  halts, \nand  does  not  always  run  upon  all  fours/ \n\nBut  here  is  Diatribe's  error  and  offence ;  she \noverlooks  the  cause  of  the  comparison  which \nought  to  be  looked  at  more  than  all  the  rest,  and  is \ncaptious  and  contentious  about  words  :  whereas \nthe  meaning  is  to  be  sought,  as  Hilary  says,  not \nonly  from  the  words  used,  but  also  from  the  causes \nwhich  give  occasion  to  them.  Thus  the  force  of  a \nsimile  depends  upon  the  cause  of  the  simile.  Why \nthen  does  Diatribe  leave  out  the  matter  for  the  sake \nof  which  Paul  uses  the  simile,  and  catch  at  what  he \nsays  over  and  above  the  cause  of  the  simile. \nWhat  he  says,  '  If  a  man  shall  have  cleansed \nhimself/  belongs  to  exhortation;  what  he  says,  6\\\\\\ \na  great  house  are  vessels,  &C/  belongs  to  teach- \ning: so  that,  from  all  the  circumstances  of  PauPs \n\nz  Velut  similes  coaptare.\"]  I  have  given  the  idea  rather  than \nthe  exact  word  :  it  is  *  pairing,  like  horses  joined  together  in \na  chariot,' \n\n\n814  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL.

This  passage,  rightly  interpreted, \ndoes  mean  the  same,  and  does  prove  the  very  thing  in  dis- \npute.— The  account  which  Luther  gives  of  this  text,  in \nits  connection  and  construction,  is  perfectly  correct.

To \nwhat  purpose  would  he  introduce  persons  mur- \nmuring against  God  as  the  potter,  if  the  fault \nwere  seen  to  be  in  the  vessel  and  not  in  the  pot- \nter? Who  would  murmur  at  hearing  that  one \nworthy  of  damnation  is  damned  ? b \n\nDiatribe  culls  a  second  absurdity  from  Madam  Reason's \nReason,  commonly  called  Human  Reason;  namely,  ^.vil  .fro™ \n'that  the  fault  is  not  to  be  imputed  to  the  vessel \nbut  to  the  potter :  especially  since  he  is  such  a \npotter  as  creates  the  very  clay  itself  and  moulds \nit.

The  flesh  does  not  think  fit  to  put \nsuch  an  honour  upon  God  as  to  believe  him  just \nand  good,  when  he  speaks  and  acts  above  and \nbeyond  the  rules  prescribed  in  Justinian's  Codex, \nor  the  fifth  book  of  Aristotle's  Ethics.  Let  the \ncreative  majesty  give  place  to  one  single  dreg \nof  his  creation,  and  let  the  famed  Corycian  cave \nchange  places  with  its  spectators,  and  stand  in \nawe  of  them,  not  they  of  if  I  So  then,  it  is  absurd \nthat  he  damns  a  person  who  cannot  avoid  de- \nserving damnation :  and  because  this  is  such  an \nabsurdity,  therefore  it  must  be  false  that  \"  he  hath \nmercy  on  whom  he  will  have  mercy,  and  whom  he \nwill  he  hardeneth.\"  But  he  must  be  brought \nto  order,  and  laws  must  be  prescribed  to  him, \nthat  he  may  not  condemn  any  one  who  has  not \nfirst  deserved  it  according  to  our  judgment.  Thus \nonly  can  they  be  satisfied  with  Paul  and  his \nsimile ;  namely,  by  his  recalling  it,  and  allowing \nit  co  have  no  meaning,  but  so  moderating  it,  that \naccording  to  Diatribe's  explanation,  the  potter \nhere  makes  a  vessel  to  dishonour,  on  the  ground  of \nprevious  deservings  :  just  as  he  rejects  some  Jews \nAnd  con-  for  unbelief;  and  takes  up  the  Gentiles  for  their \nfuted*  faith.  But  if  God's  work  be  such  that  he  have \nrespect  to  merits,  why  do  they  murmur  and  ex- \npostulate ?  How  come  they  to  say,  '  Why  doth \nhe  find  fault?  who  resisteth  his  will?'  What  need \nis  there  for  Paul  to  stop  their  mouths  ?  For  who \nwonders,  I  will  not  say  who  is  indignant  or  ex- \npostulates, if  he  be  condemned  of  his  own  desert? \nAgain;  what  becomes  of  the  power  of  the  potter \nto  make  what  he  pleases,  if  he  be  subjected  to \nmerits  and  laws  ?  ]He  is  not  suffered  to  do  what \nhe  will,  but  is  required  to   do  what  he   ought. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  317 \n\nRespect  to  merits  is  quite  at  variance  with  the     sect. \n\npower  and  liberty  of  doing  what  he  pleases :  as  v \n\nthe  householder  in  the  parable  proves,  when  he \nopposes  liberty  of  will  in  the  disposal  of  his  good \nthings  to  the  murmurs  of  his  labourers  who  de- \nmanded a  distribution  according  to  right.  These \nare  amongst  the  considerations  which  invalidate \nDiatribe's  gloss. \n\nBut  let  us  suppose  pray,  that  God  ought  to  be  Exposed \nsuch   an  one   as   hath   regard   to    merits   in  the  [\"JSt*-^ \ndamned.

If  we  caviJ \nhave  a  mind  to  follow  Reason,  it  is  equally  unjust  salvation  ' \nthat  the  unworthy  be  crowned,  as  that  the  unwor-  of  the \nthy  be   punished.     Let   us   conclude   then,    that  save  * \nGod  must  justify  on  the  ground  of  previous  de- \nservings;  or  we  shall  declare  him  unjust,  as  being \ndelighted  with  evil  and  wicked  men,  and  inviting \nthem  to  impiety  by  crowning  them  with  rewards. \nBut  woe  unto  us — who    would   then  be  indeed \nwretched  beings — if  this  were  our  God.     For  who \nthen  should  be  saved  ? — See  how  good  for  nothing- \nis  the  human  heart !     When  God  saves  the  un- \nworthy without  merit;  nay,  when  he  justifies  the \nungodly  with  much  demerit ;  this  heart  does  not \naccuse  him  of  unfairness :  this  heart  does  not  then \nimperiously  demand  of  him  why  he  wills  thus — \nthough  it  be  most  unfair,  according  to  her  own0 \njudgment — but,  forasmuch  as  it  is  advantageous \nand  acceptable  to   herself,    she  counts  this  fair \nand   good.     But,   when  he  condemns  the  unde- \nserving— seeing  it  is  disadvantageous  to  herself — \nthis  is  unfair,  this  is  intolerable:  here  comes   in \nexpostulation,  murmuring,  blasphemy. \n\nYou  see  then  that  Diatribe  and  her  friends  do  not \njudge  according  to  equity  in  this  cause,  but  accord- \ning as  their  interest  is  affected.  If  she  had  regard \nto  equity,  she  would  expostulate  with   God  for \n\nc  Luther  personifies  '  the  heart/  or  rather  e  the  wicked- \nness of  the  heart  : '  which  I  have  therefore  ventured  to  make \nfeminine. \n\n\n318  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  crowning  the  unworthy,  just  as  much  as  she  does \n\nfor  condemning  the  undeserving:  she  would  also \n\ncommend  and  extol  God  for  condemning  the \nundeserving,  just  as  much  as  she  does  for \nsaving  the  unworthy.  In  each  case  there  is \nequal  unfairness,  if  you  refer  the  matter  to \nour  own  judgment;  unless  it  be  not  equally \nunrighteous  to  commend  Cain  for  his  murder,  and \nmake  him  a  king ;  as  it  would  be  to  cast  innocent \nAbel  into  prison,  or  put  him  to  death.  When  it \nis  found  then,  that  reason  commends  God  for \nsaving  the  unworthy,  but  finds  fault  with  him  for \ncondemning  the  undeserving,  she  stands  con- \nvicted of  not  commending  God  as  God,  but  as \none  who  promotes  her  own  personal  interest :  in \nother  words,  she  looks  at  self  and  her  own  things \nin  God,  and  commends  them;  not  at  God  and  the \nthings  of  God.  The  truth  however  is,  that  if \nyou  are  pleased  with  God  for  crowning  the  un- \nworthy, you  ought  not  to  be  displeased  with  him \nfor  condemning  the  undeserving.  If  he  be  just  in \nthe  one  case,  why  not  in  the  other  ?  In  the  former \ncase,  he  scatters  favour  and  pity  upon  the  unwor- \nthy ;  in  the  latter,  he  scatters  wrath  and  severity \nupon  the  undeserving:  in  both  cases  excessive \nand  unrighteous  according  to  man's  judgment, \nbut  just  and  true  according  to  his  own.  For,  how \nit  be  just  that  he  crowns  the  unworthy,  is  incom- \nprehensible at  present  \\  but  we  shall  see  how, \nwhen  we  come  to  that  place,  where  he  will  no \nlonger  be  believed,  but  with  open  face  beheld.  So \nagain,  how  it  be  just  that  he  condemns  the  unde- \nserving, is  incomprehensible  at  present;  but  we \nreceive  it  as  matter  of  faith,  until  the  Son  of  man \nbe  revealed/ \n\nd  Luther  blunders  a  good  deal  here,  whilst  he  says  many \nexcellent  things. — In  dealing  with  this  cavil,  c  the  fault  then \nis  in  the  potter/  he  first  sets  forth  its  audacity,  next  repels \nErasmus's  gloss  by  it,  then  maintains  that  it  is  an  interested \njudgment,  not  a  judgment  of  equity,  by  which  God  is  con- \ndemned.— Much  of  the  difficulty  is,  no  doubt,  resolvable  into \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  319 \n\nDiatribe  however,  being  sorely  displeased  with     sect. \n\n\nthis  simile  of  the  potter  and  the  clay,  and  not  a  little \n\ni  ■  i     •  i  .        i      Scripture \n\nthe  sovereignty  of  God  ;  that  sovereignty  which  is  so  bitterly  must  ^e \n\noffensive  to  the  carnal  mind,  whilst  without  the  light  of  ij  we  understood \ncannot  stir  a  step  in  God.

(See \nPart  iii.  Sect,  xxviii.  notes  *  v  x.) — It  is  not  true  that  God  con- \ndemns the  undeserving,  or  that  he  crowns  the  unworthy.  Luther \ndid  not  discern  the  mystery  of  the  creation  and  fall  of  every \nindividual  man  in  Adam  (see  Part  iii.  Sect,  xxxviii.  note  l, \nPartiv.  Sect.  x.  note2),  neither  did  he  understand  the  mystery  of \nthe  predestinative  counsel.  Every  individual  of  the  human  race \nbecame  a  hell-deserving  sinner  in  Adam ;  every  individual  of  the \nsaved  is  saved  by  virtue  of  new  relations  assumed  by  God,  and \ngiven  to  him  in  Christ — as  one  previously  self-ruined,  whom \nChrist  has  rendered  worthy  to  be  taken  up  from  his  ruin,  by \nhaving  shared  it  with  him.  Predestination  is  fulfilment  fore- \narranged  ;  as  is  the  execution,  such  was  the  covenanted  design. \nIt  is  self-destroyed  ones  therefore  that  are  predestinated  to  hell  ; \neven  as  it  is  Christ-made  worthy  ones  that  are  predestinated  to \nlife. — Luther  knew  nothing  about  God's  assuming  relations, \nmuch  less  about  his  assuming  distinct  relations ;  and  shews \nonce  more  how  impossible  it  is  to  give  any  consistent  account \nof  the  salvation  of  the  righteous,  on  the  basis  of  universal \nredemption  :  such  a  redemption  must  leave  either  partiality  in \nGod,  or  merit  in  man.  Luther  will  have  it  indignos  to  avoid \nmerit,  and  therefore  leaves  God  /  a  respecter  of  persons.' — He \ndoes  not  say  a  word  too  much  about  sovereignty,  but  he  puts \nit  in  its  wrong  place,  and  omits  what  ought  to  be  added  to  it — \nthe  end  for  which  it  is  exercised.  The  place  is,  '  God  de- \ntermining to  make  creatures  with  opposite  destinies — some  to \neverlasting  life,  and  some  to  shame  and  everlasting  contempt — \nvessels  of  wrath  and  vessels  of  mercy.'  And  that  we  may  not \neven  in  heart  murmur  here,  we  must  have  an  adequate  end \n•Ziewn  to  us.  It  is  shewn  to  as  many  as  have  an  eye  to  see  it ; \n*■  he  determines  to  make,  and  he  does  make  them,  to  his  own \nglory — the  manifesting  of  himself,  according  to  what  he  really \nis.'  M  What  if  God,  willing,  &c.\"  (Rom.  ix.  22—24.) — In  the \nfulfilment  of  this  design  sovereignty  is  not  the  hinge  j  there  is \nnothing  from  first  to  last,  in  the  varieties  of  the  way  or  of  the \n\n\n320  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  indignant  to  be  so  hunted  by  it,  is  reduced  at \n\nlength  to  the   extremity   of  producing  different \n\npassages  from  Scripture,  of  which  some  seem  to \nascribe  all  to  man  and  some  all  to  grace,  and  then \ncontending  in  her  passion,  that  both  these  ought \nto  be  understood  with  a  sober  explanation/  and \nnot  to  be  taken  strictly.

But  in  this  place,  \"  If  a  man  shall  have     sect. \n\nYYvnr \n\npurged  himself  from  these/'  the  form  of  expression \nbeing  conjunctive,  neither  is  any  thing,  neither  is \nnothing  proved;  Paul  is  only  exhorting.  Or  if  you \nadd  Diatribe's  consequence  and  say,  '  he  exhorts \nin  vain,  if  man  cannot  cleanse  himself ;'  then  it  is \nproved  that  Freewill  can  do  every  thing  without \ngrace.     And  so,  Diatribe  disproves  herself. \n\nI  still  wait  for  some  passage  of  Scripture  there- \nfore, which   teaches  this  explanation;  I   do  not \ngive  credit  to  those  who  make  it  out  of  their  own \nheads.     I  deny  that  any  passage  is  found  which \nascribes  all  to  man.     I  deny  also  that  Paul  is  at \nvariance  with  himself,  when  he  says  Ci  If  a  man \nshall  have  cleansed  himself  from  these.\"     I  affirm \nthat  the  variance  in  Paul  is  not  less  a  fiction,  than \nthe   explanation   which  she  extorts  from  it  is  a \nlaboured  invention ;  and  that  neither  of  them  is \ndemonstrated.     This  indeed  I  confess,  that,  if  it \nbe  lawful  to  increase  the  Scriptures  with  these \nconsequences  and  appendages  of  Diatribe's — as \nwhen  she  says,  injunctions  are  vain  if  we  have \nnot  power  to  fulfil  them — then  Paul  is  really  at \nvariance  with  himself,  and  all  Scripture  with  him, \nbecause  then  the  Scripture  is  made  different  from \nwhat  it  was  before.     Then  also  she  proves,  that \nFreewill  can  do  every  thing.     But  what  wonder \nif,  in  that  case,  what  she  says  elsewhere  be  also \nat  variance  with  her  ;   '  that  God  is  the  alone  doer \nof  every  thing  ?'     But  this  Scripture,  so  added  to, \nis  not  only  at  war  with  us,  but  with  Diatribe  her- \nself also,  who  has  laid  it  down  that  Freewill  can \nwill  nothing  good.     Let  her  therefore  deliver  her- \nself first  of  all,  and  say  how  these  two    things \nagree   with    Paul,    c  Freewill    can   will    nothing \ngood/  and,  'if  a  man  shall  have  cleansed  himself; \ntherefore  he  can  cleanse  himself,  or  else  it  is  said \nin   vain.'     You   see   therefore    that    Diatribe   is \nplagued  to  death,  and  overcome,  by  this  simile  of \nthe  potter,  and  that  all  her  effort  is  to  elude  the \n\nY \n\n\n322 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

It  is  the  assertors  of  Freewill \nwho  make  knots  where  there  are  none,1  and  dream \nout  discrepancies  for  themselves.     For  example  ; \nthose  two  sayings,  \"  If  a  man  shall  have  cleansed \nhimself,\"  and  \"God  worketh  all  in  all,\"  are  in  no \nwise  opposite :  nor   is   it   necessary,  by  way  of \nuntying  a  knot,  to  say,   God  does  something  and \nman  does  something.     The  former  of  these  texts \nis  a  conjunctive  sentence ;  which  neither  affirms \nnor  denies  any  work  or  power  in  man,  but  pre- \nscribes  what  work  or  power  there  ought  to  be \nin  a  man.     There  is  nothing  figurative  here,  no- \nthing  which   needs  explanation ;  the  words  are \nsimple,  the  sense  is  simple,  if  you  do  not  add  con- \nsequences and   corruptives  after  the  manner   of \nDiatribe.     Then  indeed  the  sense  would  become \nunsound  :  but  whose  fault  would  it  be  ?  not  the \ntext's,  but  its  corrupter's. \n\nThe  latter  text,  \"  God  worketh  all  in  all,\"  is \nan  indicative  sentence,  affirming  that  all  work,  all \npower  is  God's.

Upon  this,  she  sallies  forth \nand  makes  boast  of  her  victories  every  where,  as \nthough  she  had  demonstrated  that  those  con- \nsequences, together  with  her  own  imagination, \nwere  as  much  a  settled  thing,  as  the  divine  autho- \nrity. Upon  this,  she  does  not  hesitate  to  pro- \nnounce that  in  some  passages  of  Scripture  every \nthing  is  ascribed  to  man ;  that  there  is  a  discre- \npancy therefore,  a  repugnacy  in  those  places, \nwhich  must  be  obviated  by  an  explanation  :  not \nseeing,  that  all  this  is  the  figment  of  her  own  brain, \nwithout  a  single  letter  of  Scripture  to  confirm  it; \nthat  it  is,  besides,  a  figment  of  such  kind,  as,  if \nadmitted,  would  confute  no  one  more  stoutly  than \nherself.  For,  would  she  not  prove  by  it,  if  she \nprove  any  thing,  that  Freewill  can  do  every \nthing? — the  express  contrary  to  that  which  she \nhas  undertaken  to  prove. \n\nUpon  the  same  principle  it  is,  that  she  so  often  in  merit \nrepeats  the  words,  c  If  man  does  nothing  there  is  ^,dre\"&c \nno  room  for  merit  \\  where  there  is  no  place  for  she  con-  * \nmerit,    there  is  no  place  for  punishment  or  for  tradicts \n\nijl  -  x  herself — \n\nrewaiCl.  proves  an \n\nAgain  she  does  not  see  how  much  more  stoutly  absurdity \n\nand  cannc \ntell  what \n\n\nshe  confutes  herself  by  these  carnal  arguments,  a \n\n\nk  Corrupia.']  The  figure  is  that  of  a  man  drowned  ;  and  the \nlast  term  expresses  the  state  of  his  substance,  when  now  it  has \nbeen  long  under  water.

If \nthere  must  be  place  for  merit,  that  there  may  be \nplace  for  reward ;  the  merit  should  be  as  big  as \nthe  reward. — But  why  do  I  lose  my  words  and \nmy  time  about  a  thing  of  nought  ?  Though  even \nall  which  Diatribe  is  contriving  should  be  built \nup  and  stand;  and  though  it  should  be  partly \nman's  work,  and  partly  God's  work,  that  we  have \nmerit ;  still  they  cannot  define  this  very  work  in \nwhich  our  merit  consists,  of  what  sort,  and  how \nbig  it  is — so  that  we  are  disputing  about  goats' \nhair.1  Well  then,  since  she  proves  none  of  those \nthings  which  she  asserts — neither  discrepancy, \nnor  qualified  interpretation — nor  can  exhibit  a \ntext  of  Scripture  which  ascribes  all  to  man ;  but \nall  these  things  are  phantasms  of  her  own  imagina- \ntion; Paul's  simile  of  the  potter  and  his  clay \nmaintains  its  ground,  unhurt  and  irresistible,  as \nproof  that  it  is  not  of  our  own  will,  what  sort  of \nvessels  we  are  formed;  and  that  those  exhorta- \ntions of  Paul's,  \"If  a  man  shall  have  purged  him- \nself\" and  the  like,  are  models  to  which  we  ought \nto  be  conformed,  but  are  no  proofs  of  either  our \nperformance  or  our  endeavour.

Lastly,  she  urges \nthat  this  saying  imports  something  else  in  the \nHebrew  language ;  that  is  to  say,  the  clemency \nand  not  the  severity  of  God,  according  to  Jerome : \nmeaning  possibly  to  persuade  us,  that,  as  this  say- \ning appertaineth  not  to  Noah  but  to  the  wicked ; \nso  the  severity  and  not  the  clemency  of  God \nappertaineth  to  Noah,  the  clemency  and  not  the \nseverity  of  God  appertaineth  to  the  wicked ! — \nBut  we  will  pass  over  these  fooleries  of  Diatribe's, \nwho  is  every  wliere  telling  us  that  she  counts  the \nScriptures  a  fable.  I  care  not  what  Jerome  says \nin  his  trifling  way  here  :  it  is  certain  he  proves \nnothing ;  and  we  are  not  inquiring  what  Jerome \nthinks,  but  what  the  Scripture  means.  Let  the \nperverters  of  Scripture  pretend,  that  the  Spirit  of \nGod  means  his  indignation.  I  affirm  that  she \nfails  in  her  proof  two  ways :  first,  in  that  she \ncannot  produce  a  single  text  of  Scripture  in \nwhich  the  Spirit  of  God  is  taken  for  God's  indig- \nnation; whilst  kindness  and  sweetness  on  the  con- \ntrary are  every  where  ascribed  to  him :  secondly, \nin  that  if  she  could  by  any  means  prove,  that  it  is \nsome  where  or  other  taken  for  indignation,  still \nshe  cannot  forthwith  prove,  that  it  necessarily \nfollows  it.  must  also  be  taken  so  here.  So  again, \nlet  her  pretend  that  the  flesh  is  taken  for  infir- \nmity, still  she  just  in  the  same  degree  proves \nnothing.  For,  whereas  Paul  calls  the  Corinthians \ncarnal,  he  certainly  does  not  mean  to  impute \ninfirmity,  but  fault  to  them — complaining  as  he \ndoes,  that  they  were  oppressed  with  sects  and  par- \nties ;  which  is  not  infirmity,  or  incapacity  to  re- \nceive more  solid  doctrine,  but  the  old  leaven  of \n\n\n326  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  malice :  which  he  commands  them  to  purge  out. \n\nLet  us  examine  the  Hebrew. \n\n\"  My  Spirit  shall  not  always  be  judging  man^ \nbecause  he  is  flesh.\"  This  is  word  for  word  what \nMoses  says  :m  and,  if  we  would  give  up  our  own \n\nm  I  am  disposed  to  give  rather  a  different  turn  to  the  declara- \ntion, though  in  no  wise  affecting  Luther's  argument.  All  he \nwants  to  shew  is,  that  they  are  words  of  anger,  not  of  pity  and \npalliation.  But  since  the  word  which  we  render  \"strive  \"  and \nwhich  Luther  renders  \"judge  \"  properly  signifies  *  debate  '  or \n'  judgment  given  after  discussion  j?  why  might  not  the  senti- \nment be  \"  My  Spirit  shall  not  be  always  proving  that  man  is \nflesh  ;*  or  \"  shall  not  always  be  reproving  him  for  being \nflesh  V*  The  great  reason  for  continuing  man  in  existence \nafter  the  original  and  damning  transgression  was,  that  he \nmight  shew  himself  what  he  is,  as  he  has  made  himself;  so \ndifferent  from  what  God  made  him.  The  Lord  here  says,  he \nwill  carry  on  this  work  of  manifestation — this  controversy,  as \nit  may  be  called — no  longer  than  for  one  hundred  and  twenty \nyears.  There  seems  to  be  no  great  importance  in  the  an- \nnunciation that  he  would  not  strive  because  he  is  flesh.  He \nwas  so  from  the  first  moment  of  transgression  5  and  not  more  so \nnow,  than  from  that  moment.  But  the  manifestation  having \nbeen  carried  far  enough,  there  was  now  a  reason  why  it  should \ncease.  This  trial,  or  controversy,  or  judgment,  or  proof,  or \nreproof,  was  effected  by  the  divine  Spirit  both  mediately  and \nimmediately  acting  upon  their  spirit.  Luther  confines  it  to  the \neffect  of  their  intercourse  with  others  ;  such  as  Noah,  and  those \nof  the  Lord's  people  who  had  lived  and  were  living  with  those \ngenerations  of  men  :  in  whom  the  Spirit  of  God  was.  But  did \nnot  that  Spirit  also  act  upon  these  disobedient  ones,  without \ntheir  intervention  ?  that  Spirit,  which,  according  to  Luther, \n'moves   and  drives  '  all  God's  creatures. — (  p-j  appendere — \n\nlitem  vel  causam  agere — quomodo  '  disceptare  '  signift.  et \nt  judicare.'  fut  ftTl  disceptabit.

But  the  XXXVIL \nwords  which  go  before  and  which  follow  after, \nconnected  as  they  are  with  the  bringing  on  of  the \nflood,  sufficiently  shew  that  they  are  the  expres- \nsions of  an  angry  God.  They  were  occasioned  by \nthe  fact  of  the  sons  of  men  marrying  wives  through \nthe  mere  lust  of  the  flesh,  and  then  oppressing \nthe  earth  with  tyranny,  so  as  to  compel  God  to \nhasten  the  flood,  through  his  anger;  scarcely \nallowing  him  to  defer  for  an  hundred  years  what \nhe  would  otherwise  never  have  brought  upon  the \nearth.  Read  Moses  carefully,  and  you  will  see \nthat  he  clearly  means  this.  But  what  wonder  that \nthe  Scriptures  are  obscure,  or  that  you  set  up  not \nonly  Freewill,  but  even  Divine  will  through  their \nmeans,  if  you  be  at  liberty  to  sport  with  them  as  if \nyou  were  looking  for  scraps  and  shreds  of  Virgil  in \nthem.n  This  forsooth  is  untying  knots  and  putting \nan  end  to  questions  by  a  qualified  interpretation ! \nBut  Jerome  and  his  friend  Origen  have  filled \nthe  world  with  these  trifling  conceits,  and  have \nbeen  the  originators  of  this  pestilent  precedent \nfor  not  consulting  the  simplicity  of  Scripture.0 \n\nIt  was  enough  for  me,  that  it  be  proved  from \nthis  text,  that  divine  authority  calls  men  flesh ; \nand  in  such  manner  flesh,  that  the  Spirit  of  God \ncould  not  continue  amongst  them,  but  at  a  fixed \nperiod  must  be  withdrawn  from  them.  He  ex- \nplains presently  what  he  means  by  declaring  that \nhis  Spirit  shall  not  always  judge  amongst  men ; \nby  prescribing  the  space  of  an  hundred  and  twenty \nyears,  as  that  in  wrhich  he  should  still  judge.     He \n\nin  opposition  to  those  who  had  thrown  it  off.  The  great \noffence  and  provocation  seems  to  have  been  given  by  that  hypo- \ncritical remnant,  to  and  concerning  which  Enoch,  as  appears \nfrom  Jude,  verse  15,  had  previously  prophesied. \n\n11  Virgilicentonas.~\\     More  literally,  '  Virgilian  centos.' \n°  Simplicitati  scripturarum  studeretur.~\\    i.  e.   taking  care   to \nmaintain  a  plain  sense  where  it  is  practicable,  in  opposition  to  a \nfigurative  one. \n\n\n328  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  opposes  the  Spirit  to   the  flesh,   because   men, \n\nbeing  flesh,  do  not  receive  the  Spirit ;  and  he, \n\nbeing  Spirit,  cannot  approve  the  flesh:  whence  it \nwould  arise,  that  he  must  be  withdrawn  after  an \nhundred  and  twenty  years.  So  that  we  may  un- \nderstand the  passage  in  Moses  thus  :  '  My  Spirit, \nwhich  is  in  Noah  and  my  other  saints,  reproves \nthose  wicked  men  by  the  word  they  preach,  and \nby  the  holy  life  they  lead  (for  to  judge  amongst \nmen  is  to  exercise  the  ministry  of  the  word \namongst  them p — to  reprove,  rebuke,  and  entreat, \nin  season  and  out  of  season);  but  in  vain.  For \nthey,  being  blinded  and  hardened  by  the  flesh, \nbecome  worse  the  more  they  are  judged :  just  as \nit  is,  whensoever  the  word  of  God  comes  into  the \nworld \\  men  are  made  worse,  the  more  they  are \ninstructed.  And  this  is  the  cause  why  the  wrath \nof  God  is  now  hastened,  just  as  the  flood  also \nwas  hastened  in  that  day ;  not  only  do  men  sin \nnow-a-days,  but  even  grace  is  despised,  and  as \nChrist  says,  \\  Light  is  come  but  men  hate  light/ \n\nSince  men  are  flesh  therefore,  as  God  himself \ntestifieth,  they  can  mind  nothing  but  the  flesh  ;  so \nthat  Freewill  can  have  no  power  but  to  commit \nsin :  and  since,  with  even  the  Spirit  of  God \ncalling  amongst  them  and  teaching  them,  they \ngrow  worse ;  what  would  they  do  when  left \nto  themselves,  without  the  Spirit  of  God? — Nor \nis  it  any  thing  to  the  purpose  here,  that  Moses \nspeaks  of  the  men  of  that  age.  The  same  is  true \nof  all  men,  since  all  are  flesh,  as  Christ  says  in \nJohn  iii.  6.  if  That  which  is  born  of  the  flesh  is \nflesh. \"  How  great  a  malady  this  is,  he  teaches \nus  himself  on  the  same  occasion,  when  he  says, \n\"  No  one  can  enter  into  the  kingdom  of  God,  ex- \ncept he  have  been  born  again.\"  Let  the  Chris- \ntian know  therefore,  that  Origen  and  Jerome,  and \n\np  Officio  verbi  inter  eos  agere.~\\  Implying  more  than  mere \npreaching  5  he  has  before  said  '  per  verbum  prsedicationis  et \nvitam  piorum  ;'  it  is  word  administered  by  mouth  and  life. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  329 \n\nall  their  tribe,  are  guilty  of  a  pernicious  error  in     sect. \ndenying  that  the  flesh  is  to  be  taken  for  ungodly   ^^ \naffection  in  these  places.     For  that  expression  in  \" \n1  Cor.  iii.  \"Ye  are  yet  carnal?'  bespeaks  ungod- \nliness.    Paul  means  that  they  had  ungodly  per- \nsons  still   auiougst  them;  and  further,   that  the \ngodly,    so   far  as  they   mind   carnal  things,  are \ncarnal;  although  they  have  been  justified  by  the \nSpirit. \n\nIn  short,  you  will  observe  in  Scripture  that \nwheresoever  the  flesh  is  treated  of  in  opposition \nto  the  Spirit,  you  may  almost  always  understand \nby  the  flesh  every  thing  that  is  contrary  to  the \nSpirit.  For  instance ;  \"  The  flesh  profiteth  no- \nthing.\" But  where  it  is  treated  of  absolutely, \nyou  may  know  that  it  denotes  the  bodily  nature \nand  condition  :  as  \"  They  two  shall  be  one  flesh.\" \n(i  My  flesh  is  meat  indeed.\"  \"  The  word  wras \nmade  flesh.\"  In  these  places  you  may  change  the \nHebrew  idiom  and  say  'body/  instead  of  flesh: \nthe  Hebrew  language  expressing  by  one  word \n6  flesh/  what  we  do  by  the  words  '  flesh '  and \nc  body/  I  wish  indeed  that  it  had  been  so  trans- \nlated, by  distinct  terms,  throughout  the  whole \ncanon  of  Scripture,  without  exception. — So  that \nmy  text  from  Gen.  vi.  will  still  maintain  its  place \nboldly,  I  think,  as  the  opponent  of  Freewill:  since \nit  is  proved,  that  the  flesh,  as  here  spoken  of,  is \nthat  same  substance  of  which  Paul  says  in  Ro- \nmans viii.  that  \"  neither  can  it  be  subjected  to \nthe  will  of  God\"  (as  we  shall  see  when  we  come \nto  that  place);  and  of  which  Diatribe  says  her- \nself, that  it  can  will  nothing  good.q \n\ni  It  is  impossible  to  understand  this  text  so  as  that  it  shall \nnot  be  a  decisive  testimony  against  Freewill.

The  second  passage  is  from  Gen.  viii.  \"  The \nimagination  and  thought  of  man's  heart  are  prone \nto  evil  from  his  youth.\"  And  in  chap.  vi.  \"  Every \nthought  of  man's  heart  is  intent  upon  evil  con- \nGen,  viii.  tinualiy.\"  She  puts  off  this  by  saying,  c  The  prone- \n21.  and  ness  ^0  evil,  which  is  in  most  men,  does  not  alto- \ntained.     \"  gether  take  away  the  freedom  of  the  will/ \n\nBut  does  God,  pray,  speak  of  most  men,  and \nnot  rather  of  all  men,  when,  as  if  repenting  himself \n\nwhat  difference  does  this  make  as  to  the  question  of  Freewill  \\ \nEvery  individual  man  is  by  natural  constitution  \"  enmity \nagainst  God ;\"  so  far  as  that  natural  constitution  remains  in \nthe  saint,  he  also  is  enmity.  The  passage  under  consideration \neither  says,,  or  implies,  being  he  is  flesh,  he  is  contrary  to  the \nSpirit  and  offensive  to  God.  What  is  the  state  of  his  will \nthen  ? — I  would  rather  understand  the  word  *  flesh '  here,  of \nhis  whole  substance  or  constitution  than,  as  Luther  and  most \nother  divines  do,  of  '  an  affection '  of  it.  Indeed,  I  consider \nthat  much  jargon  has  been  introduced  into  theology  by  this \ndistinction.  It  has  led  to  what  is  called  the  doctrine  of  two \nprinciples  (the  term  (  principle '  being  a  very  indefinite  one, \nand  a  shelter  for  almost  every  thing  that  is  unknown  or  wishes \nto  be  obscure)  ;  whereas  I  believe  there  are  few  if  any  places \nin  Scripture,  in  which  it  may  not  be  understood  of  '  the  human \nsubstance,'  either  in  its  complexity  as  soul  and  body,  or  in \nits  dividuality,  as  body  only. — I  by  no  means  subscribe  to \nthe  interpretation  which  Luther  assigns  to  some  of  the  texts \nhe  adduces.  \"  The  flesh  proiiteth  nothing  \"  is  not  (  evil  affec- \ntion '  but  '  the  natural  substance  of  man  .  as  contrasted  with \nf  the  Spirit/  \"  The  word  was  made  flesh,\"  does  not  declare \nbody  in  opposition  to  soul,  but  that  whole  human  person  which \nthe  second  Person  of  the  ever-blessed  Trinity  did  verily  and \nactually  assume  into  union  with  himself  when  the  fulness  of \nthe  time  was  come.  So  \"my flesh  is  meat  indeed\"  does  not \nexclude  his  soul  as  made  an  offering  for  sin  :  neither  does  the \n<c  one  flesh  \"  which  the  church  is  made  to  be  with  Christ  ex- \nclude him  that  is  joined  to  the  Lord  from  being  one  Spirit. — \nAs  a  hint  to  shew  that,  if  Luther's  interpretation  and  distinction \nwith  respect  to  the  term  '  flesh  '  be  admitted,  a  third  must  at \nleast  be  added  (viz.  this  sense  which  comprehends  the  whole \nhuman  substance,  and  so  constitutes  a  title  which  distinguishes \nman  from  all  other  creatures) ;  I  would  mention  Psalm  cxlv.  21, \nLuke  iii.  6.  Isaiah  xl.  5, 6.  John  xvii.  2.  1  Cor.  i.  29.  to  which \nothers  without  number  might  be  added. — Luther  speaks  with \nsufficient  exactness  of  the  presence  and  withdrawal  of  the \nSpirit  to  make  it  clear  that  he  did  not  understand  Him  to  have \ndwelt  in  the  ungodly  -,  whilst  he  omits  a  very  important  part  of \nHis  agency.

For  thus  it  is  written  in  chap.  vi. \n\"  Every  imagination  of  the  thoughts  of  his  heart \nis  only  evil  all  his  days/'     He  does  not  say  intent \nupon,  or  prone  to  evil,  but  absolutely  evil  ;  and \nthat  nothing  but  evil  is  imagined  and  thought  of \nby  man  all  his  life.

As  to  Diatribe's  cavil,  '  Why  is  space \ngiven  for  repentance,  if  repentance  be  in  nowise \ndependent    upon    the   will,    but   every  thing   is \nwrought  by  necessity?'  my  reply  is,  you  may  say \nthe  same  of  all  the  precepts  of  God :  why  does  he \nenjoin,  if  all  things  happen  by  necessity  ?

This  means,  ?  Jerome  says  so,  therefore  it \nis  true/    I  affirm  that  Isaiah  asserts  a  certain  pro- \nposition in  most  express  words,  and  Jerome  is \ncast  in  my  teeth ;  a  man,  to  speak  in  the  gentlest \nterms,  of  no  judgment  or  diligence.

So  again,  \"  No  man  is  crowned  except \nhe  strive  lawfully.\"  He  clothes  both  the  Ephe- \nsians  and  the  Thessalonians  with  armour,  and \nboasts  that  he  has  himself  fought  the  good  fight: \nand  the  like  in  other  places/  So  in  1  Kings \n(I  Samuel),  it  is  written  in  the  Hebrew  text, \nthat  the  sons  of  Eli  slept  with  the  women  who \nwere  performing  service  (literally,  ' warring')  at \nthe  door  of  the  tabernacle  of  the  covenant :  of \nwhose  warfare  Moses  also  maketh  mention  in \nExodus/  Hence  too,  the  God  of  that  people  is \ncalled  the  Lord  of  Sabaoth ;  that  is,  the  Lord  of \nwarfare  or  of  armies. \n\nIsaiah  therefore  declares,  that  the  warfare  of  a \nlegal  people  with  which  they  were  harassed  under \nthe  law,  as  with  an  insupportable  burden  (accord- \ning to  the  testimony  of  Peter  in  Acts  xv.),  should \nbe  finished ;  and  that  they,  being  delivered  from \nthe  law,  should  be  translated  into  the  new  service  of \nthe  Spirit.  Moreover,  this  end  of  their  most  hard \nservice,  and  this  succession  of  a  new  and  most \nfree  one  shall  not  be  given  them  through  their \nmerit  (since  they  could  not  even  bear  that  service), \nbut  rather  through  their  demerit;  because  their \nwarfare  is  finished  in  this  manner,  through  their \niniquity  being  freely  forgiven  them.  Here  are  no \nobscure  or  ambiguous  words.  He  says  that  their \nwarfare  shall  be  finished,  because  their  iniquity  is \nforgiven  them  ;  plainly  intimating,  that  they,  as \nsoldiers  under  the  law,  had  not  fulfilled  the  law — \nneither  could  have  fulfilled  it — but  had  been  war- \nring in  the  service  of  sin,  and  had  been  sinner \n\nx  2  Tim.  ii.  3.  1  Tim.  vi.  12.  1  Cor.  ix.  24—27.  2  Tim.  ii.  5. \nEphes.  vi.  1  Thess.  v.  2  Tim.  iv.  7. \n\ny  Exod.  xxxviii.  8.

Warfare  is  her  legal  service.  2.  She \nonly  sinned  in  that  service.  3.  She  was  rewarded  for  sin,  not \nmerit. — The  truth,  if  I  mistake  not,  lies  nearer  home.  Why  not \nunderstand  fC  double  for  all  her  sins\"  as  a  phrase  to  denote, \nthat  '  great  and  manifold  as  her  sins  had  been,  she  was  re- \nceiving the  double  of  them  in  divine  favour.'  Double  is  a  finite \nput  for  an  infinite.  (So  Isa.  lxi.  7-  Jerem.  xvi.  18.  xvii.  IS. \nZech.  ix.  12.  Rev.  xviii.  6.)  Her  warfare  is  the  whole  interval \nof  her  toil  and  labour. — I  cannot  but  think  that  the  prophecy \nin  its  consummation  is  still  future ;  though  it  has  already  re- \nceived a  partial  fulfilment.  Jerusalem's  warfare  is  not  yet \naccomplished  :  but  the  whole  space  from  the  Lord's  first \ncoming  in  the  flesh  to  his  hereafter  coming  in  glory  is  com- \nprehended in  this  prophecy ;  in  which  it  will  at  length  be  seen \nthat  the  Jerusalem  (  which  then  was'  had  an  interest.  The \nvisible  church  received  this  f  double '  at  the  coming,  or  rather \nat  the  ascension,  of  the  Lord  Jesus  ;  when  her  covenant  of \ncondemnation  was  exchanged  for  a  covenant  of  righteousness. \nBut  the  prophecy  looks  farther ;  even  to  the  end  of  that \nnew  dispensation  which  John  Baptist  began,  when  the  true \nchurch — \"  the  church  of  the  first-born,  which  are  written  in \nheaven\" — shall  receive  its  consummation  and  bliss ;  and  the \nnational  Israel,  which  has  been  running  a  parallel  with  it \nthroughout  the  whole  of  its  history,  shall  receive  and  enjoy \nwhat  it  has  never  yet  truly  possessed — its  Canaan  and \nits  Temple.  Thus,  I  neither  understand  the  c  warfare,'  nor \nthe  f  double,'  with  Luther's  strictness ;  I  might  rather  say,/ar- \nfetched-ness :  nor  do  I  place  this  text  where  he  would  place \nit,  as  a  testimony  against  Freewill.    It  is  only  by  implication \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  337 \n\nAs  to  what  Diatribe   argues,   that  c  although  sect.xl. \n\nsin  abounds  through  the  law,  and  where  sin  hath  \n\nabounded,  Grace  also  abounds;  but  it  does  not  ^P1S0°e \n\n\"   o  \"  upon  ijtou  s \n\nfollow  hence,  that  man,  assisted  by  the  help  of  help.— \nGod,  cannot,  even  before  grace  makes  him  ac-  Cornelius \nceptable,  prepare   himself,    by   means    of  works \nmorally  good,  for  the  divine  favour  :' \n\nI  shall  wonder,  if  Diatribe  be  speaking  here  of \nher  own  head,  and  have  not  culled  this  flower \nfrom  some  document  sent  or  obtained  from  some \nother  quarter;  which  she  has  entwined  into  her \nown  nosegay.b  She  neither  sees,  nor  hears,  what \nher  own  words  mean.  If  sin  aboundeth  by  the \nlaw,  how  is  it  possible  that  a  man  can  prepare \nhimself  by  moral  works  for  the  divine  favour  ? \nHow  can  works  profit,  when  the  law  does  not \nprofit  ?  or  what  else  is  it  for  sin  to  abound  by  the \nlaw,  but  that  works  done  according  to  the  law \nare  sins  ?  But  of  this  in  another  place. — Then \nwhat  is  it  she  says,  that  c  man  assisted  by  the \nhelp  of  God  can  prepare  himself  by  good  works  V \nAre  we  arguing  about  God's  help,  or  about  Free- \nwill ?  What  is  not  possible  to  the  divine  help  ? \nBut  this  is  just  what  I  said,  Diatribe  despises  the \ncause  she  is  pleading,  and  therefore  snores  and \ngapes  so  in  the  midst  of  her  talk. \n\nBut  she  adduces  Cornelius  the  centurion,  as \nan  example  of  a  man  whose  prayers  and  alms \nhave  pleased  God,  before  he  was  yet  baptized, \nand  inspired  with  the  Holy  Spirit. \n\na  testimony  against  Freewill  j  it  is  a  broad,  palpable  testi- \nmony to  \"  reigning  grace  :\"  sin  is  requited  with  super- \nabounding,  free  favour  ;  and  it  is  implied  that  there  has  been, \nand  could  be,  nothing  but  sin  going  before. — The  hypothetical, \nand  therefore  questionable,  nature  of  Luther's  interpretation  is \nmanifested  by  his  own  testimonies:  all  rest  upon  'militia;' \nwhich  he  makes  law-service.  But  does  not  he  cite  the  Gospel \nalso  called  a  warfare  ?  To  whom  are  these  sayings  in  Timothy, \nthe  Corinthians,  Ephesians,  &c.  addressed  ? \n\nb  Libro  suo  inseruerit.~]  I  have  ventured  to  maintain  Luther's \nfigure  of '  decerpserit.' \n\nZ \n\n\n338  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  I  also  have  read  Luke's  account  in  the  Acts  ; \nbut  I  have  never  found  a  single  syllable  which \nindicates  that  the  works  of  Cornelius  were  morally \ngood  without  the  Holy  Spirit,  as  Diatribe  dreams. \nOn  the  contrary,  I  find  that  he  was  a  just  man, \nand  one  that  feared  God :  for  so  Luke  calls  him. \nBut  for  a  man  to  be  called  a  just  man  and  one \nthat  fears  God,  without  the  Holy  Spirit,  is  to  call \nBelial  Christ. — Then  again,  the  whole  argument \nin  that  passage  goes  to  prove  that  Cornelius  was \none  clean  in  the  sight  of  God  :  even  the  vision, \nwhich  was  sent  down  from  heaven  to  Peter,  and \nwhich  also  rebuked  him,  testifies  this;  nay,  the \nrighteousness  and  faith  of  Cornelius  are  cele- \nbrated by  Luke  in  such  great  words,  and  by  such \ngreat  deeds,  that  it  is  impossible  to  doubt  them. \nDiatribe  however,  with  her  friends  the  Sophists, \ncontrives  to  be  blind,  and  to  see  the  contrary, \nwith  her  eyes  open,  amidst  the  clearest  light  of \nwords  and  evidence  of  facts.  Such  is  her  want  of \ndiligence  in  reading  and  observing  the  Scriptures ; \nwhich  in  that  case  may  well  be  defamed  as  ob- \nscure and  ambiguous.  What  though  he  had  not \nyet  been  baptized,  and  had  not  yet  heard  the  tes- \ntimony to  Christ's  resurrection !  Does  it  follow \nfrom  thence  that  he  had  not  the  Holy  Spirit  ?  On \nthe  same  principle,  you  will  say  that  John  the \nBaptist  also,  with  his  father  and  mother — next, \nChrist's  mother  and  Simeon — had  not  the  Spirit ! \nBut  away  with  such  thick  darkness  !c \nsec.xli.

But  he  had  already \nbeen  brought  by  the  Spirit  of  Christ  into  a  state  to  receive \nHim  when  he  should  be  manifested  by  preaching ;  and  the \nLord  had  reserved,  and  still  doth  reserve,  this  honour  for  his \noutward  word,  and  for  his  accredited  ambassadors. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  339, \n\nthereof  as  the  flower  of  grass;  the  grass  wither-  sec.xli. \neth,  and  the  flower  thereof  falleth,  because  the      ;        ' \nSpirit  of  the  Lord  bloweth  upon  it;\"  &c.  seems  6**7*  main- \nto  my  Diatribe  to  suffer  very  great  violence,  when  tained. \ndrawn  to  the  subject  of  grace  and  Freewill.  Why \nso,  pray  !     Because  Jerome,  says  she,  takes  the \nSpirit  for  indignation,  and  the  flesh  for  the  infirm \nstate  of  man ;  which  cannot  stand  against  God. \nAgain  are  the   trifling  conceits  of  Jerome  pro- \nduced to  me  instead  of  Esaias.     I  have  a  harder \nfight  to  maintain  against  the  weariness  with  which \nDiatribe's  carelessness  consumes  me,  than  against \nDiatribe   herself.     But   I   have   said  very  lately \nwhat  I  think  of  Jerome's  sentiment. — Let  us  com- \npare Diatribe's  self  with  herself.    Flesh,  says  she, \nis  the  infirm  state  of  man.     Spirit  is  the  divine \nindignation.     Has  the  divine  indignation  nothing \nelse  then  to  dry  up,  but  only  this  wretched  and \ninfirm  condition  of  man;  which  it  ought  rather \nto  raise  up  than  to  destroy  ? \n\nBut  this  is  a  finer  touch  still. — c  The  flower  of \ngrass  is  the  glory  which  arises  from  prosperity  with \nrespect  to  bodily  things.  The  Jews  gloried  in  their \ntemple,  in  circumcision,  and  in  their  sacrifices  : \nthe  Greeks  in  their  wisdom.'  So  then,  the  flower \nof  grass  and  the  glory  of  the  flesh  is  the  righte- \nousness of  works  and  the  wisdom  of  the  world. \nHow  is  it  then,  that  righteousness  and  wisdom  are \ncalled  bodily  things  by  Diatribe  ?  What  must \nthen  be  said  to  Esaias  himself,  who  explains  him- \nself in  words  without  figure,  where  he  says, \n\"  Truly  the  people  is  grass.\"  He  does  not  say, \n'■  Truly  the  infirm  condition  of  man  is  grass,'  but \ncc  the  people  is  grass ;\"  and  he  asserts  it  with  an \noath.  What  is  the  people  then?  Is  it  only  the \ninfirm  condition  of  man  ?  I  do  not  know  indeed \nwhether  Jerome  means  '  the  creature  itself,'  or \n*  the  wretched  lot  and  state  of  man,'  by  c  the  in- \nfirm condition  of  man.' — But,  whichsoever  of  the \ntwo   it  be,  the   divine   indignation   '  carries   off \n\nz2 \n\n\n340  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  wonderful  praise  and  ample    spoils   assuredly/ d \n\nin  drying  up  a  wretched  creature,  or  men  that  are \n\nin  a  state  of  imhappiness,  instead  of  scattering \nthe  proud  and  putting  down  the  mighty  from  their \nseat,  and  sending  the  rich  empty  away ;  as  Mary \n\n\nsc.  xlii.      But  let  us  bid  adieu  to  our  spectres,  and  fol- \n\nlow  Esaias.    The  people,  says  he,  is  grass.

Its  glory  is \nrightly  called  the  flower  of  grass ;  forasmuch  as \nthey  boasted  of  their  dominion,  their  government, \nand  especially  of  their  law,  of  God,  of  righteous- \nness and  wisdom ;  as  Paul  argues  in  Rom.  ii.  iii. \nix.     When  Esaias  therefore  says,   \"  all  flesh ;\" \nwhat  is  this  else  but  all  the   grass,  or  all  the \npeople  ?     For  he  does  not  simply  say,  \"  flesh,\" \nbut  \"  all   flesh.\"     Now  there  pertaineth  to   the \npeople  soul,  body,  mind,  reason,  judgment  and \nwhatsoever  can  be  mentioned  or  discovered  that \nis  most  excellent  in  man.     For  he  who  says  \"  all \nflesh  is  grass\"  excepts  no  one,  but  the  Spirit  which \ndries  it  up.     So  neither  does  he  omit  any  thing \nwho  says,  \"  the  people  are  grass.\"     Let  there  be \nFreewill  then,  let  there  be  whatsoever  is  accounted \nhighest  and  lowest  in  the  people,  Esaias  calls  all \nthis  flesh  and  grass  :  seeing  that  these  three  nouns, \nflesh,  grass,  people,  according  to  the  interpret- \nation of  the  very  author  of  the  book,  mean  the \nsame  thing  in  this  place. \n\nThen  again,  you  affirm  your  own  self,  that  the \nwisdom  of  the  Greeks,  and  the  righteousness  of \nthe  Jews,  which  were  dried  up  by  the  Gospel, \nare  grass,  or  the  flower  of  grass.

You  have  your  own \nself's  confession  (made  perhaps  without  knowing \nwhat  you  was  saying),  that  the  wisdom  of  the \nGreeks  is  grass,  or  the  glory  of  grass ;  which  is \njust  the  same  thing  as  calling  it  flesh.

He  says  \"  That  which \nis  born  of  the  flesh  is  flesh\"  means  '  that  which  is  born \nof  the  flesh  is  sinful,  or  ungodly,  affection;'  in  short,  is \nc  wicked,'  or  f  wickedness.'  I  say  f  flesh'  means  the  same  in \nthe  subject  and  in  the  predicate  ;  '  that  which  is  born  of  man \nis  man.'  What  this  is,  as  to  its  nature,  properties  and  qua- \nlities, must  be  sought  elsewhere  :  but  the  next  clause  gives  us \na  pretty  good  hint  at  these,  by  implying  that  it  is  of  a  nature \ndirectly  contrary  to  that  of  the  Holy  Ghost ;  \"  That  which  is \nborn  of  the  flesh  is  flesh ;  and  that  which  is  born  of  the  Spirit \nis  Spirit.\"  The  Scripture  is,  moreover,  abundantly  explicit  in  its \ntestimony  to  what  this  nature  is,  by  giving  us  a  full  and  com- \nplete history  of  its  creation  and  depravation,  and  by  asserting  in \nthe  clearest  and  strongest  terms  its  total,  universal,  complicated, \nand  pervasive  villainy.  Take  but  these  four  passages,  to  which \nscores  might  be  added,  and  let  them  teach  us  '  what  that  flesh \nis  which  flesh  begets,  and  brings  forth.'  \"  What  is  man,  that \nhe  should  be  clean  ?  and  he  which  is  born  of  a  woman,  that \nhe  should  be  righteous  ?  Behold,  he  putteth  no  trust  in  his \nsaints,  and  the  heavens  are  not  clean  in  his  sight  :  how  much \nmore  abominable  and  filthy  is  man,  which  drinketh  iniquity \nlike  water  r\"  (Job  xv.  14 — 16.)  \"  Behold  I  was  shapen  in \niniquity,  and  in  sin  did  my  mother  conceive  me.\"  (Psalm  II.  5.) \n\"  The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things,  and  desperately \nwicked ;  who  can  know  it  ?\"  (Jerem.  xvii.  9.)  \"  For  from \nwithin,  out  of  the  heart  of  man,  proceed  evil  thoughts,  adul- \nteries, fornications,  murders,  thefts,  covetousness,  wickedness, \ndeceit,  lasciviousness,  an  evil  eye,  blasphemy,  pride,  foolish- \nness :  all  these  evil  things  come  from  within,  and  defile  the \nman.\"  (Mark  vii.  21 — 23.) — It  is  not  therefore,  that  I  draw  a \ndifferent  testimony  from  John  iii.  6.  but  I  make  it  a  step  to  ex- \nplicit proof,  rather  than  explicit  proof  itself ;  and  by  so  doing \ncut  the  sinews  of  objection  here,  whilst  I  also  preserve \nsimplicity  and  uniformity  in  the  interpretation  of  Scripture \nterms.* \n\n*  For  a  more  full  consideration  of  the  terms  flesh  and  spirit,  I  venture  to \nrefer  the  reader  to  '  Vaughan's  Clergyman's  Appeal,'  chap.  iii.  sect.  iii.  and \nchap,  v.  sect.  ii.  iv.  where  some  account  is  given  of  the  nature  state  of  man, \nand  of  the  sanctincation  of  the  Lord's  people,  which  I  deem  satisfactory. \n\n\n346 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

Nay,  it  appeared  at  the  same  time  on  sc.xliii. \n\nthe  very  outside  of  their  performance  that  they \n\nwere  doing  all  these  things  for  their  own  glory; \ninsomuch  that  they  were  not  ashamed  to  confess \nand  to  make  it  their  boast,  that  they  were  seek- \ning their  own  glory.  For  it  was  glory  burning \nthem  through  and  through,  which  led  even  these \nRomans,  according  to  their  own  testimony,  to  do \nwhatsoever  they  did  that  was  virtuous;  which \nsame  thing  is  true  both  of  the  Greeks  also,  and  of \nthe  Jews  also,  and  of  the  whole  human  race. \n\nNow,  although  this  be  honourable  amongst \nmen,  still  nothing  can  be  more  dishonourable  in \nthe  sight  of  God ;  nay,  in  his  sight,  it  was  the \nmost  impious  and  consummate  sacrilege,  that  they \ndid  not  act  for  the  glory  of  God,  neither  did  they \nglorify  him  as  God,  but,  by  the  most  impious \nsort  of  robbeiy,  stole  the  glory  from  God  and \nascribed  it  to  themselves :  so  that  they  were \nnever  less  honourable  and  more  vile,  than  whilst \nshining  forth  in  their  most  exalted  virtues.  But \nnow,  how  could  they  act  for  the  glory  of  God, \nwhen  they  knew  nothing  of  God  and  of  his  glory: \nnot  for  that  these  did  not  appear,  but  because  the \nflesh  did  not  suffer  them  to  see  the  glory  of  God, \nthrough  the  rage  and  madness  with  which  they \nwere  raving  after  their  own  glory.  Here  then,  you \nhave  the  chieftain  spirit  (rf/suovixov),  that  prin- \ncipal part  of  man,  striving  after  things  honour- \nable— in  other  words,  exhibiting  itself  as  the  rob- \nber of  God's  glory,  and  the  affectant  of  his \nMajesty — in  the  case  of  those  men  most  of  all, \nwho  are  the  most  honourable  and  the  most  illus- \ntrious for  their  consummate  virtues.

Now,  sc.xliv. \n\nif  it  be  far  from  the  kingdom  and  Spirit  of  God,  \n\nit  must  necessarily  follow  that  it  is  under  the \nkingdom  and  spirit  of  Satan — there  being  no \nmiddle  kingdom  between  the  kingdom  of  God \nand  the  kingdom  of  Satan  ;  which  are  perpetually \nfiffhtins:  ao-ainst  each  other.  These  considerations \nprove  that  the  most  consummate  virtues  amongst \nthe  heathens — the  best  sayings  of  their  philoso- \nphers, and  the  most  eminent  actions  of  their \ncitizens — however  they  may  be  spoken  well,  and \nmay  appear  honourable  in  the  sight  of  the  world \n— are  truly  but  flesh  in  the  sight  of  God,  and \nservices  rendered  to  Satan's  kingdom ;  that  is, \nimpious  and  sacrilegious,  and  in  all  respects \nevil. \n\nBut  pray  let  us  for  a  moment  suppose  Dia-  Conse- \ntribe's  assertion  to   stand  good,  that  the  whole  ^hlt*  of \nconstitution  of  man  is  not  flesh  ;  that  is,  wicked  :  sumption \nbut  that  part  of  it,  which  we  call  spirit,  is  honest  respecting \nand  sound.     See  what  absurdity  follows  hence,  manwirich \nnot  in  the  sight  of  human  reason  it  is  true ;  but  is  not \nwith  reference  to  the  whole  religion  of  Christ,  '  es  ' \nand  to  the  principal  articles  of  the  faith.     For  if \nthe  most  excellent  part  in  man  be  not  ungodly, \nlost  and  damned,  but  only  the  flesh ;  that  is,  the \ngrosser  and  inferior  affections;    what  sort  of  a \nRedeemer  shall  we  make  out  Christ  to  be  ?    Shall \nwe  represent  the   worth   of  his    most   precious \nblood-shedding  to  be  so  small  that  it  only  redeemed \nthe  vilest  part  in  man;  whilst  the  most  excellent \npart  in  man  is  strong  of  itself,  and  hath  no  need \nof  Christ?     Henceforth  then,   we   must   preach \nChrist,  not  as  the  Redeemer  of  the  whole  man, \nbut  of  his  most  worthless  part — that  is,  the  flesh; \nwhilst  man  is  himself  his  own  redeemer  in  his \nbetter  part. \n\nChoose  which  of  the  two  you  please.  If  the \nbetter  part  of  man  is  sound,  it  does  not  stand  in \nneed  of  Christ  as  a  Redeemer.     If  it  does  not \n\n\n350  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  stand  in  need  of  Christ,  it  triumphs  over  Christ \nwith  a  glory  superior  to  his — as  curing  itself, \nwhich  is  the  better  part,  whereas  Christ  cures \nonly  the  more  worthless.  Then  again,  the  king- \ndom of  Satan  also  will  be  nothing ;  as  reigning  over \nthe  viler  part  of  man,  whilst  it  is  itself  rather \nruled  by  man,  as  to  his  better  part.  Thus  it  will \nbe  brought  to  pass  by  this  dogma  concerning  the \nprincipal  part  of  man,  that  man  is  exalted  above \nboth  Christ  and  the  devil ;  that  is,  he  will  be \nmade  God  of  Gods,  and  Lord  of  Lords. — What \nbecomes  then  of  that  approvable  opinion,  which \naffirmed  that  Freewill  can  will  nothing  good? \nHere,  on  the  contrary,  she  contends  that  this  same \nFreewill  is  the  principal  part,  and  the  sound  part, \nand  the  honest  part;  that  which  hath  no  need \neven  of  Christ,  but  can  do  more  than  God  him- \nself and  the  devil  can.  I  mention  this,  as.  in \nformer  instances/  my  Erasmus,  that  you  may  see \nagain,  how  dangerous  a  thing  it  is  to  attempt \nsacred  and  divine  things  without  the  Spirit  of \nGod,  under  the  rash  guidance  of  human  reason. — \nIf  then  Christ  be  the  Lamb  of  God,  who  taketh \naway  the  sin  of  the  world;  it  follows  that  the \nwhole  world  is  under  sin,  damnation  and  the \ndevil;  and  the  distinction  between  principal  parts, \nand  not  principal  parts,  avails  nothing.

In  its  most  correct  view,  it  is  the  sacrament  of  the  Resur- \nrection ;  of  our  having  died  and  risen  again  with  Christ — into \nwhom  we  have  been  baptized — in  a  figure ;  of  which,  our \nbeing  in  the  number  of  those,  for  whom  and  with  whom  he \nhas  died,  in  order  that  they  might  be  raised  up  again  from  the \ndead  with  him  and  for  his  sake — at  an  appointed  time — is  the \nreality.  By  baptism  therefore,  the  Lord's  people  are  sealed  to \nbe  in  the  state  of  those  who  have  risen  from  the  dead  5  who \nalready  have  that  which  is  to  be  had  in  this  life  of  the  resur- \nrection from  the  dead,  in  possessing,  acting  and  enjoying  a \nrisen  Spirit — and  who  have  the  pledge  of  God,  which  cannot \nlie,  that  they  shall  have  the  superabundant  residue  both  in \ntheir  person  (a  raised  body)  and  in  their  state  (partakers  of \nthe  glory  which  shall  be  revealed.)  In  whatever  form  the \nordinance  be  administered,  whether  by  immersion,  affusion,  or \naspersion,  it  is  in  effect  the  same  teaching  sign ;  the  laver  of \nregeneration  being  the  Lord's  blood,  and  its  application  to  our \nperson  denoting  our  union  with  him  in  his  death  and  resurrec- \ntion. It  is  this  signing-,  sealing  ordinance,  I  say,  to  God's \nelect,  and  to  none  else  :  who,  when  they  have  been  called  by \nthe  Spirit  (which  may  be  before  or  after — if  one  part  of  the \nsign  must  be  future,  why  may  not  both  :),  are  led  and  enabled \neither  to  wait  upon  the  Lord  in  the  receiving  of  it,  or  to  look \nback  to  it  as  a  benefit  already  received. — Hosts  of  objections \nwill  rise  up,  no  doubt,  against  this  testimony.  Why  then  are \ninfants  baptized  r  Why  is  baptism  administered  to  the  non- \nelect  ? — I  am  not  careful  to  answer  these  questions  of  the \nnatural  man.  Infant  baptism  however,  I  remark,  must  stand \nupon  its  own  grounds  of  vindication ;  and,  for  my  own  part,  I  am \ncontent  with  God's  having  commanded  every  male  Israelite  to \nbe  circumcised  on  the  eighth  day. — Administered  to  non- \nelect  !

The  meaning  of  the \nordinance  is  not  impaired  by  these  mysterious  arrangements  j \nand  it  is  just  so  much  of  shame,  grief  and  weakness  to  the \nspiritual  man,  if  he  do  not  use  and  enjoy  the  pregnant \nsign. — I  have  mixed  this  reference  to  baptism  with  the  subject \nof  regeneration,  not  only  because  so  mixed  by  the  Fathers \nand  by  the  Apostles,  but  because  I  cannot  doubt  that  the  Lord \nhad  a  reference  to  it  in  John  iii.  5.  (Except  a  man  be  begotten \nby  the  Spirit  out  of  water ;  i.  e.  begotten  by  the  Spirit  in  and \nthrough  that  water  which  is  the  sacramental  emblem  of  my \nblood;  he  can  have  no  part  or  lot  in  the  kingdom  of  God)  ; \nand  because  I  consider  it  as  so  illustrative  of  the  real  nature \nof  regeneration  :  which  I  cannot  allow  to  be  either  character \nor  state  only,  but  must  regard  as,  in  its  more  enlarged  sense, \ncomprehending  both.  How  simple  and  how  sweet  the  view \nthus  opened  to  us  of  the  Lord's  sacraments  !  Baptism,  the \nsacramental  introduction  of  the  Lord's  people  into  the  resur- \nrection state  5  and  the  communion  of  the  body  and  blood,  the \nsacrament  of  their  continual  life  therein. — The  phrase  (  rena- \ntus  per  fidem\"  then,  which  both  Erasmus  and  Luther  adopt, \nis  allowable  as  expressive  of  that  state  into  which  the  eternally \nforeknown  of  God  are  brought,  when,  having  already  been \nregenerated  in  Spirit,  they,  by  faith  and  calling  upon  God,  are \nregenerated  in  state.  In  this  state,  they  live  and  walk  by  and \nin  the  Spirit. — Then  what  has  this  state  of  theirs  to  do  with \nthe  question  of  Freewill  -,  or  rather,  with  all  that  has  just  been \nargued  about  man's  being  flesh — whatever  be  meant  by  that \nword  ?  He  that  hath  been  begotten,  or  born,  of  the  Spirit  is \nSpirit,  and  has  the  Spirit  dwelling  and  walking  in  him,,  and \nserveth  God  therein. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  353 \n\nyou  please  ;  it  is  your  look  out  what  you  believe,  sc.  xlv. \n\nwhen  you  believe   men    who   dictate   their   own  \n\nopinions  without  any  authority  from  the  word  of \nGod:  and  perhaps  it  is  not  a  matter  of  religions \nanxiety  which  torments  you  much,  what  any  man \nbelieves  ;  since  you  so  easily  give  credit  to  men, \nwithout  heeding  whether  what  they  say  be  certain \nor  uncertain  in  the  sight  of  God. — /  also  have  my \nquestion  to  propose  for  information:  when  did  I \never  teach  what  you  so  freely  and  so  publicly \nimpute  to  me?  Could  any  one  be  so  mad  as  to \nsay,  that  the  man  who  hath  been  born  of  the  Spi- \nrit is  nothing  but  flesh?  I  decidedly  separate \nflesh  and  Spirit  as  substances  at  variance  with \neach  other;  and  affirm,  in  unison  with  the  sacred \noracle,  that  the  man  who  hath  not  been  born  again \nby  faith  is  flesh :  I  affirm  further,  that  the  regenerate \nman  is  flesh,  only  so  far  as  pertaineth  to  that  re- \nmainder11 of  the  flesh  in  him,  which  fighteth  against \nthe  first-fruits  of  the  received  Spirit. — I  cannot \nthink  you  so  base  as  wilfully  to  have  feigned  this, \nby  way  of  exciting  ill-will  against  me  :  else,  what \ncould  you  have  imputed  to  me  of  a  more  atrocious \nnature  ?  But  either  you  know  nothing  of  my \nmatters,  or  you  seem  unequal  to  the  weight  of \nthe  subject;  by  which  you  are  so  pressed  and \nconfounded,  that  you  do  not  sufficiently  remem- \nber what  you  say  either  against  me,  or  for  your- \n\nu  Secundum  reliquias.~]  Luther  speaks  of  this  remainder,  as \nmany  other  divines  do,  in  a  manner  which  implies  that  the \nwork  of  the  Spirit  upon  the  substance  of  the  soul  in  regene- \nration is  incomplete  :  whereas  it  shall  receive  no  increase  or \nalteration  for  ever.  The  body  only  is  unrenewed,  and  shall \nremain  so  till  the  resurrection.  The  variety  is  in  the  ener- \ngizings  of  the  within-dwelling  Spirit :  which,  unto  God's \nglory  in  our  real  good,  are  neither  uniform  nor  perpetual ;  and \nso  give  occasion  to  the  unrenewed  part  of  our  frame,  and  to \nour  enemies  without,  to  gain  many  a  transient  victory  over \nus. — What  I  have  already  said  and  referred  to,  about  e  flesh' \nand  f  spirit,'  will  serve  to  shew  that  my  account  of  this \nremainder  would  differ  some  little  from  Luther's. — See  above. \nSect.  xlii.  notes  '  and  k.

I  do  not  know  how  this  inability  to  will \nany  thing  good,  is  compatible  with  some  seeds  of \nhonesty.

But  what  need \nwas  there  of  such  authoritativeness  in  the  man,  to \nenable  him  to  consider  the  sense  and  scope  of \nthe  Prophet  ?  ^  It  is  enough,  says  Mr.  Erasmus  ; \ntherefore  it  is  so/  Allow  the  adversaries  of  the \ntruth  this  lust  for  glossing,  and  what  will  they \nnot  gain  ?  Let  him  teach  us  this  gloss  then  from \nthe  context,  and  we  will  believe  him.  On  the \ncontrary,  I  shew  from  that  very  context,  that \nwhilst  the  Prophet  sees  himself  engaged  in  teach- \ning the  ungodly  with  so  much  importunity  to  no \npurpose,  he  at  the  same  time  perceives  that  his \nword  avails  nothing,  unless  God  teach  it  within  ; \nand  that  it  is  not  at  the  disposal  of  man  there- \n\nv  Luther  defends  his  interpretation  of  Isaiah  xl.  6,  7-  by \n1.

This  new \nevasion  is  invented,  it  is  true,  in  order  that \npersons  unpractised  and  unskilled  in  falsehood \nmay  fancy  they  have  received  a  satisfactory  ex- \nplanation of  the  text — the  same  sort  of  trick \nwhich  is  practised  in  the  attempt  to  evade  the \nnecessity  of  a  consequence.  They  clo  not  see \nthat  they  are  so  much  the  more  ensnared  and \nentrapped  by  these  evasions,  than  by  the  plain \nmeaning  of  the  words;  so  misled  are  they  by \nthese  new  terms  !  Why,  if  the  event  of  temporal \nconcerns  and  transactions,  over  which  man  is \nconstituted  lord  and  master  (Genesis  i.),  be  not \nunder  our  own  control;  how  shall  that  celestial \nsubstance,  the  grace  of  God,  which  is  dependent \nupon  the  will  of  God  alone,  be  under  our  control  ? \nCan  the  effort  of  Freewill  obtain  eternal  salvation, \nwhen  it  cannot  keep  the  printer's  dagger,  or \neven  a  hair  of  one's  head  in  its  place  ?

I  am  sur- \nprised too,  that  Diatribe,  who  has  so  persecuted \nthat  saying  of  WicklifPs  hitherto,  '  all  things \nhappen  by  necessity,'  should  now  of  her  own \naccord  concede,  that  events  are  necessary  to  us.a \n\n6  Besides,  if  you  force  it  never  so  much,  says \nshe,  that  it  may  bear  upon  the  subject  of  Free- \nwill, does  not  every  body  confess  that  no  one \ncan  maintain  an  upright  course  of  life  with- \nout the  grace  of  God  ?  Still  however,  we  strive \nin  the  mean  while  ourselves  also,  according  to \nour  ability;  inasmuch  as  we  pray  daily,  u  O  Lord \nmy  God,  direct  my  way  in  thy  sight.\"  He  who \nsues  for  help  does  not  lay  aside  endeavour/ \n\nDiatribe  thinks  it  does  not  signify  a  straw  what \nshe  answers ;  provided  she  be  not  silent,  but \nsay  something.  Having  done  so,  she  would  be \nthought  to  have  satisfied  everybody;  so  confident \nis  she  in  her  own  authority. — The  thing   to  be \n\n\nz  Creatls  eventibus.  divinis  eventibus.\"]  Luther  has  said  (see,  as \nat  note  x),  that  a  dominion  has  been  given  to  man  over  the  infe- \nrior creatures,  in  the  exercise  of  which  he  would  not  object  to \nits  being  said  that  he  has  Freewill.  There  are  creature-events \ntherefore,  and  God-events  ;  that  is,  events  which  are  convers- \nant with  creatures  only,  and  events  which  are  conversant  with \n€Jod  also  :  these,  in  which  he  has  to  deal  with  creatures,  are \nof  small  moment  with  respeet  to  those  in  which  he  has  to  deal \nwith  the  Creator.  Temporal  prosperity  is  of  the  former  ;  sal- \nvation is  of  the  latter. — I  deny  the  justness  of  the  distinction  -, \nand  must  allow,  that  we  have  rather  too  much  of  the  gla- \ndiator in  this  paragraph.  Luther's  defence  of  his  text  is  cor- \nrect j  but  to  give  his  adversary  another  thrust  when  he  is \nfallen,  he  goes  into  refinements  which  will  not  stand.

Their  necessity  inspires  us  with  that  fear \nof  God,  which  is  our  antidote  against  presumption \nand  security ;  whilst  their  uncertainty  begets  a \nconfidence,  which  fortifies  our  minds  against \ndespair. \n\nBut  she  returns  to  her  old  song,  c  that  in \nthe  book  of  Proverbs  many  things  are  said  in \nfavour  of  Freewill  -/  such  as  this,  c  Confess \nthy  works  unto  the  Lord/  Dost  thou  hear, \nsays  she?  thy  works. — That  is,  there  are  many \nimperative  and  conjunctive  verbs  in  that  book \nand  many  pronouns  in  the  second  person :  for \nby  such  supporters  Freewill  is  proved.  As \nfor  instance,  f  confess  ;'  therefore  thou  canst  con- \nfess :  '  thy  works;'  therefore  thou  doest  them. \nSo  that  saying,  \"I  am  thy  God,\"  you  will  under- \nstand to  mean,  ^thoumakest  me  thy  God/  \"Thy \nfaith  hath  made  thee  whole:\"  dost  thou  hear? \n\"  thy  faith.\"  Expound  thus,  '  thou  makest  thy- \nself to  have  faith/  And  now  you  have  proved \nFreewill. — I  am  not  mocking  here,  but  shewing \nthat  Diatribe  is  not  in  earnest,  when  pleading \nthis  cause. \n\nThat  saying  in  the  same  chapter,  u  The  Lord \nhath  made  all  things  for  himself;  even  the  wicked \nfor  the  day  of  evil,\"  she  absolutely  moulds  into  a  new \nshape  by  words  of  her  own ;  urging  in  excuse  for \nGod,  that  he  hath  not  made  any  creature  evil.d \n\nAs  if  I  spoke  of  creation,  and  not  rather  of  that \nconstant  operation  of  God  upon  things  created,  by \n\n\nProv.  xvi \n4. \n\n\nd  See  Part  iv.

By- \nGod's  inclining  of  the  heart  is  meant,  not  that \nsleepy  lazy  thing  which  Diatribe  pretends,  but  that \nmost  efficacious  operation  of  God,  which  the  man \ncannot  avoid  or  change;  and  by  which  he  neces- \nsarily has  such  a  will  as  God  hath  given  to  him, \nand  such  a  will  as  God  hurries  along  with  his  own \nmotion.     I  have  spoken  to  this  point  already.6 \n\nBesides,  since  Solomon  speaks  of  the  king's \nheart,  Dia tribe  thinks  that  this  text  is  improperly \ndrawn  to  express  a  general  sentiment ;  but  that  it \nmeans  what  Job  says  in  another  place,  \"  He \nmaketh  a  hypocrite  to  reign  for  the  sins  of  the \npeople.\"  Job  xxxiii.  30.  At  length  she  concedes \nthat  the  king  is  moved  by  God  to  evil,  but  in \nsome  such  way  as  this ;  e  God  suffering  the  king  to \nbe  driven  by  his  passions,  in  order  that  he  may \nchastise  his  people/ \n\nI  reply;  whether  God  permit  or  incline,  the \nvery  act  of  permitting  or  inclining  arises  from \nthe  will  and  operation  of  God  :  because  the  king's \nwill  cannot  escape  the  actuation  of  the  omni- \npotent God;  forasmuch  asf  every  man's   will  is \n\ne  See  above,  Sect.  xi.  note  h. \n\nf  Quia.]  I  should  have  liked  qud  instead  of  quia,  if  there  had \nbeen  any  authority  for  it. — For  the  principle  maintained,  see \nabove,  Sect.  xi.  and  note  h. \n\n\n360  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  hurried  on  by  him  to  will  and  to  do,  whether  it \nbe  good  or  evil.

For  if  the  king's \nheart  which  seems  to  be  especially  free  and  to \nhave  lordship  over  others,  cannot  however  will \notherwise  than  God  shall  have  inclined  it ;  how \nmuch  less  can  any  of  the  rest  of  men  do  so?  And \nthis  same  consequence   would   stand   good,    not \nonly  with  respect  to  the  king's  will,  but  also  with \nrespect  to  any  man's  will.     For  if  one  man,  how- \never private,  cannot  will  before  God g  except  as \nGod  inclines  him,  the  same  mast  be  said  of  all \nmen.     So  the  fact  that  Balaam  could  not  speak \nwhat  he  pleased,  is  an  evident  proof,   contained \nin  the  Scriptures,  that  man  is  not  the  free  chooser, \nor   doer,  of  his   own  law,h  or  work :  else  there \nwould  be  no  such  thing  as  examples  in  the  Scrip- \ntures.1 \nsect.

But  I  shall  look  sharp  after  this \nmagniloquous  and  heroic  Diatribe,  to  see  what \nforce  it  is  of  hers,  by  which  she  gets  the  better  of \nmy  Achilles  ;  when  she  has  not  yet  hit  a  single \ncommon  soldier — no  not  even  a  Thersites — -but  has \ndestroyed  herself  most  miserably  by  her  own \nweapons. \n\nSo  then,  she  lays  hold  of  this  little  word  what \nc  nothing/  and  slays  it  by  the  aid  of  many  words  'nothing' \nand  many  examples  ;  dragging  it  to  this  result  by \na  commodious  interpretation,  that  c  nothing  *  may \nbe  the  same  as  small  and  imperfect :  that  is,  she \nholds  forth  in  other  words  what  the  Sophists  have \nheretofore  taught  thus  on  this  passage — \"without \nme  ye  can  do  nothing  ;\"  that  is,  nothing  per- \nfectly. Such  is  the  power  of  her  rhetoric,  that \nshe  contrives  to  make  this  gloss,  which  has  now \nfor  a  long  time  been  stale  and  mouse-eaten, \nappear  like  something  new ;  and  insists  upon  it \nin  such  a  way,  that  you  might  think  she  has  been \nthe  first  to  bring  it  forwards,  that  it  never  was \nheard  of  before,  and  that  it  is  little  less  than  a \nmiracle  which  she  is  exhibiting  in  the  production \nof  it.  Meanwhile,  she  is  quite  careless  and \nthoughtless  about  the  text  itself,  and  its  fore  and \nafter  context ;  from  which  the  knowledge  of  it  is \nto  be  sought :  not  to  mention  that  her  aim  Js  to \n\n\nmeans. \n\n\n362  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  shew,  by  so  many  words  and  examples,  how  this \n—  word  '  nothing '  may  be  taken  here  for  '  some- \nthing small  and  imperfect;'  as  if,  forsooth,  we \nwere  disputing  about  what  might  be — when  the \nthing  to  be  proved  is,  whether  it  ought  to  be \ntaken  so.  The  whole  of  her  magnificent  inter- \npretation therefore  amounts  but  to  this,  if  to  any \nthing,  that  this  passage  of  John's  is  made  uncer- \ntain and  ambiguous:  and  what  wonder,  when  it \nis  Diatribe's  one  and  alone  object,  to  make  out \nthat  the  Scriptures  are  every  where  ambiguous, \nlest  she  should  be  compelled  to  use  them ; k  that \nthe  testimonies  of  the  Fathers  are  decisive,  that \nshe  may  have  liberty  to  abuse  them.

And  in  this  sense,  says  she, \nit  is  most  true  that  we  can  do  nothing  without \nChrist :  for  he  speaks  of  Gospel  fruit,  which  be- \nfals  none  but  those  who  are  abiding  in  the  Vine  ; \nthat  is,  Christ. \n\nHere,  she  confesses  herself  that  fruit  befals \nnone  but  those  who  abide  in  the  Vine ;  and  this \nshe  does,  in  that  self-same  commodious  interpret- \nation by  which  she  proves  that  c  nothing '  means \nthe  same  with  c  small  and  imperfect.'  Perhaps \nwe  ought  also  to  interpret  the  adverb  c  not '  com- \nmodiously,  so  as  to  signify  that  gospel  fruit  befals \nmen  out  of  Christ  in  some  measure,  or  in  a  small \nand  imperfect  degree ;  hereby  announcing  that \nungodly  men,  without  Christ,  with  the  devil  reign- \ning in  them  and  fighting  against  Christ,  may  yield \n\n\nk  Uti.  abuti.~\\  Ut.

We  knew \nthis  well  enough,  even  before  we  had  ever  heard \nthe  name  of  Erasmus.  But  the  question  is,  whe- \nther it  be  satisfactory  that  the  Scripture  should  be \npulled  to  pieces  by  a  little  word  ?  The  matter  in \ndispute  is,  whether  it  be  rightly  pulled  to  pieces \nthus,  and  whether  it  must  be  pulled  to  pieces  thus. \nLet  a  man  direct  his  view  to  this  point,  and  he \nwill  see  how  easy  it  is  to  pull  the  Scriptures  to  pieces, \nand  how  detestable  is  Luther's  positiveness.  But \nthe  truth  is,  he  will  see  that  it  is  not  a  parcel  of \nlittle  words,  nor  yet  all  the  gates  of  hell  that  can \ndo  any  thing  towards  accomplishing  this  object. \n\nLet  us  then  do  what  Diatribe  cannot  for  her  Luther \naffirmative,  and,  though  we  have  no  business  to  do  provef  the \nso,  let  us  prove  our  negative  ;  extorting  by  force \nof  argument  the  concession,  that  the  word \n'  nothing'  here  not  only  may,  but  must  be  taken  to \nsignify  not  <a  little,'  but  what  it  naturally \nexpresses.  This  I  will  do  by  arguments  additional \nto  that  invincible  one  which  has  already  given  me \nvictory;  namely,  that  words  ought  to  be  kept  to \n\nm  Uno  verbulo.~\\  Alluding  to  this  little  word  e  nothing,'  I \nsuppose.  All  Luther's  force,  he  would  say,  is  in  this  Achillean \nlance  ;  which  we  break  by  our  interpretation  of  the  word \n'  nothing.' \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\ntheir  natural  meaning,  unless  the  contrary  shall \n~~  have  been  demonstrated:\"  which  Diatribe  neither \n\nnatureTof e  nas  done,  nor  can  do  here. — First  then,  I  extort \nthe  case,  this  concession  from  the  very  nature  of  the  case. \nIt  has  been  proved  by  testimonies  of  Scripture, \nwhich  are  neither  ambiguous  nor  obscure,  that \nSatan  is  by  far  the  most  powerful  and  most  crafty \nprince  of  the  princes  of  this  world;0  as  I  have \nsaid :  under  whose  reign  the  human  will,  which \nis  now  no  longer  free,  and  its  own  master,  but  the \nslave  of  sin  and  Satan,  cannot  will  any  thing  but \nwhat  this  prince  of  hers  shall  be  pleased  to  let  her \nwill.  Nor  will  he  suffer  her  to  will  any  thing \ngood  :  albeit,  if  Satan  did  not  rule  her,  sin  itself \nwhose  servant  man  is,  would  be  a  sufficient  clog \nupon  her  to  prevent  her  willing  good.p \n\nSecondly,  the  very  sequel  of  the  discourse — \nwhich  Diatribe  in  her  valour  despises,q  although \nI  had  commented  upon  it  very  copiously  in  my \nassertions — extorts  the  same  concession.  For \nChrist  goes  on  thus  in  John  xv.  \"  If  a  man  abide \nnot  in  me,  he  is  cast  out  as  a  branch,  and  he \nwithereth,  and  they  gather  him  up,  and  cast  him \ninto  the  fire,  and  he  burnetii.\"  These  words,  I \nsay,  Diatribe  acting  the  part  of  a  most  profound \nrhetorician  has  passed  over ;  in  hopes  that  this \ntransition  would  be  incomprehensible  to  such \nunlettered  readers   as  the  Lutherans.     But  you \n\nn  See  above,  Sect.  iii. \n\n°  Longe  potentiss.  et  caUidiss.  mundi.~\\  There  is  a 'little  ambi- \nguity in  the  expression  j  but  he  clearly  means  to  compare  the \ndevil  with  other  earthly  Princes. \n\np  Luther  speaks  as  others  speak  ;  leaving  it  to  be  imagined, \nthat  sin  is  a  substance,  and  has  a  real  and  positive  existence. \n(See  above,  Sect.  xi.  note  h.)  The  more  correct  statement  is, \n'  the  human  soul  is  itself  a  substance  sinful  and  devilish  ;  and \nwould  remain  so — willing  according  to  its  nature — if  Satan  and \nhis  agency  were  withdrawn  from  it. \n\ni  Fortiter  contemnit.~]  The  taunt  is  obscure ;  but  I  under- \nstand it  to  insinuate,  that  Diatribe  has  a  good  deal  of  that \n'  better  part  of  valour,  which  is  discretion.' \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  367 \n\nperceive  that  Christ,  becoming  himself  the  inter-  sect.li. \n\npreter  of  his  own  simile  of  the  branch  and  the — \n\nvine  here,  most  expressly  declares  what  he  would \nhave  to  be  understood  by  the  word  c  Nothing  f, \nnamely,  that  a  man  out  of  Christ  is  cast  forth  and \nwithereth.  And  what  else  can  this  being  cast \nforth  and  withering  mean,  but  that  he  is  delivered \nover  to  the  dominion  of  the  devil,  and  is  continu- \nally made  worse  ?  But  to  grow  worse  and  worse \nis  not  to  have  power,  or  to  endeavour.  The \nwithering  branch  is  made  more  and  more  ready \nfor  the  burning,  the  more  it  withereth.  If  Christ \nhad  not  thus  opened  and  applied  this  simile, \nnobody  would  have  dared  to  open  and  apply  it \nso.  It  is  established  therefore,  that  the  word \nf  Nothing '  must  be  taken  literally  here,  according \nto  its  natural  import/ \n\nLet  us   now   look  also  into  the  examples   by  3.  By  re- \nwhich  she  proves  that  ' nothing\"  is  in  some  places  fating Dia- \ntaken  for  '  a  little  f  in  order  to  shew,  that  in  this  amplest\" \npart  of  her  argumentation  also  Diatribe  is  nothing, \nand  effects  nothing.     Yet,  if  she  had  even  proved \n\n\nr  I  should  rather  rest  the  conclusion  upon  the  scope  and \ntrain  of  the  parable,,  than  upon  the  interpretation  of  the  figures \nin  any  one  verse  :  a  good  general  rule  for  the  interpretation  of \nparables.  We  may  overstrain  parts  ;  but  we  cannot  be  wrong \nin  seizing  the  general  outline,  and  maintaining  the  broad  prin- \nciple which  is  illustrated  5  where  that  can  be  distinctly  ascer- \ntained.— Perhaps  I  should  not  interpret  this  parable  just  as \nLuther  does.  I  consider  it  as  a  representation  of  the  visible \nchurch  5  exhibiting  two  sorts  of  members,  fruitful  and  unfruit- \nful. The  fruitful  only  are  Christ's  true  ones  3  and  their  fruitful- \nness  is  dependent  altogether  upon  a  real,  continued  and  unob- \nstructed union  with  himself.  It  is  with  reference  to  their  con- \ntinuance in  him,  that  this  nothingness  is  spoken  of.  Should  they \nbe  cut  off  from  him — suppose  them  to  have  been  never  so  fruit- \nful— (thus  the  parable  speaks)  their  fruitfulness  would  cease — \nentirely  cease .  Both  the  end  and  the  way  require  that  the  nothing \nbe  an  absolute  nothing. — Luther  cannot  state  the  result  of  non- \nunion, or  dis-union,  more  awfully  than  I  would  do  ;  but  I \nshould  question  the  parable's  setting  this  out  with  the  minuteness \nwhich  he  assigns  to  it,  and  do  not  see  it  necessary  to  the  con- \nclusion he  is  sustaining.  It  is  quite  enough  that  the-  disunited \nbranch  is  a  cast-away  waiting  for  the  burning. \n\n\n368  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  something  here,  she  would  have  effected  nothing  ; \n\nsuch  a  perfect  nothing  is  she,  in  all  her  parts  and \n\nin  all  her  means.3  ^  It  is  a  common  saying  (she \navers)  that  a  man  does  nothing,  if  he  does  not \nobtain  what  he  seeks  after;  but  still,  the  man  who \nendeavours  frequently  makes  some  way  towards \nhis  object/ \n\nI  reply,  I  never  heard  that  this  is  a  common \nsaying ;  you  take  the  liberty  of  imagining  so. \nWords  (so  far  as  they  give  names  to  things1)  must \nbe  considered  according  to  the  subject  matter,  and \nwith  relation  to  the  intention  of  the  speaker.  Now \na  man  never  calls  that  '  nothing/  which  he  endea- \nvours when  in  action;  nor  does  he  speak  of  his \nendeavour  when  he  talks  about  '  nothing/  but  of \nthe  effect :  this  is  what  a  man  is  looking  at,  when \nhe  says  '  that  man  does  nothing,  or  effects  nothing/ \nthat  is,  e  he  has  not  reached  his  point,  he  has  not \nobtained.' — Besides,  if  your  instance  proves  any \nthing  (which  however  is  not  the  case),  it  makes \nmore  for  me  than  for  you.  For  this  is  the  very \npoint  I  am  maintaining,  and  wishing  to  get  proved; \nthat  Freewill  does  many  things,  which  are  but \nnothing  in  the  sight  of  God.u  What  is  the  use \nof  her  endeavouring,  if  she  does  not  gain  what \nshe  seeks  ? — So  that,  let  Diatribe  turn  which  way \nshe  will,  she  founders  and  confutes  herself,  as  is \nusually  the  case  with  advocates  pleading  a  bad \ncause. \n\nThus   again,    she   is  unhappy   in  her  instance \n\ns  Per  omnia  et  omnibus  modis.']  Per  omn.  the  several  parts \nof  her  argument.

Luther  replies,  this  is  said \nof  the  effect,  not  of  the  act:  but  if  it  be  said  of  the  act,  this \nproves  for  me  :  doing,  he  does  not ;  for  in  the  sight  of  God \nhis  work  is  nothing.  Coram  Deo,  in  a  former  instance  (see \nabove,  Sect.  xxxi.  note  a),  referred  to  God's  presence  as  an  agent  j \nhere  refers  to  it  as  a  spectator. \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  369 \n\nwhich   she  adduces   from  Paul,  \"Neither  is  he     sect. \nthat  planteth  any  thing,  nor  he  that  watereth,  but       LIL \nGod  that  giveth  the  increase.\"     What  is  of  very  ]       ... \nlittle  moment,    and    useless    of   itself,    he    calls \nc  nothing ;'  says  she. \n\nWho  is  this?

But  be  it,  that  it  illustrates  the  agency  of  the  free \nwill  under  the  ministry,  without  grace  :  this  agency  is  nothing \nin  the  sight  of  God,  though  not  an  absolute  nothing  in  itself.— \nThis  conclusion  however  is  drawn  from  a  double  misapplication \nof  the  text :  it  is  act,  instead  of  effect ;  and  it  is  act  of  the \nhearer,  not  of  the  speaker. \n\n2b \n\n\n370  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  IV.  maintain  the  same  tiling  with  respect  to  Freewill. \n\nSo  that  this  example  also  stands  up  for  me  against \n\nDiatribe  herself,  unless  it  be  that  Diatribe  is  even \njet  ignorant  what  our  ground  of  battle  is.x     We \nare  not  speaking  of  an  existence  of  nature ;  but \nof  an  existence  of  grace,  as  they  call  it.     We \nknow  that  Freewill  performs  certain  natural  acts ; \nthat  she  eats,  and  drinks,  and  begets  children,  and \nrules   the  house.     So  that  Diatribe   might  have \nforborne  to  mock  us  with  that  nonsensical  saying, \nwhich  is  like  the  ramble  of  a  delirium,  'that  a  man \ncannot  even  sin,  without  Christ/  if  we  insist  upon \nthis  word  6  nothing  f  whereas  even  Luther  admits \nthat   Freewill  has  a   power  of   committing    sin, \nthough  it  hath  no  other ! — The  wise  Diatribe,  you \nsee,  must  have  her  joke  even  upon  a  serious  sub- \nject.— What  we  affirm  is,  that  man  without  the \ngrace  of  God  still  remains  under  the  control  of \nthe  general  omnipotency  of  God,  who  performs, \nwho  moves,   who  carries    away  all  things  by  a \nnecessary  and  infallible  course ;  but  what  the  man \nso    carried  away   does,    is    \"nothing\" — that  is, \navaileth  nothing  before  God,  and  is  accounted \nnothing  but  sin.     Thus — with  regard  to  a  being \nof  grace — he  is  nothing  who  hath  not  charity. — \nWhy   then   does   Diatribe,    after   confessing   of \nher  own  accord  that  we  are  in  this  place  treating \nof  evangelical  fruit,  which  is  not  produced  without \nChrist,  here  in  an  instant  turn  aside  from  the \nquestion  at  issue,  begin  a  strange  song,  and  cavil \nabout    natural    operations    and    human    fruits  ? \nWhy— but  that  a  man  destitute  of  the  truth,  is \nnever  any  where  consistent  with  himself  ?y \nJohn  iii.

The  void  was  nothing,  till  the  infi- \nnity of  eternal  atoms  rushed  into  it  by  a  blind  and  rapid \nmovement,  and  thus  settled  into  a  world. — Aristotle's  c  infi- \nnite '  is  his  (  first  moveable '  eternally  put  into  motion  by  his \n*  first  Mover,'  and  made  to  be  what  it  is,  at  its  one  first  projection, \nby  Him.

For  wherefore  have  we  need  of  grace  ; \n\nk  Encomion.']  A  Greek  derivative ;  whence  our  English \nword  e  encomium  '  also  :  applied  peculiarly  to  the  laudatory \nsongs  which  were  sung  to  the  praise  of  the  conqueror  amidst \nthe  tumultuous  revels  of  his  Triumph. — See  Introd.p.  4. \n\n1  Feasts  in  honour  of  Bacchus ;  which  were  not  only  drunken \nbouts,  but  scenes  of  proud  display,  to  the  praise  of  the  glory  of \nman.  They  imitated  the  poetical  fictions  concerning  Bacchus  -, \nputting  on  fawn  skins,  crowning  themselves  with  garlands  and \npersQnating  men  distracted. \n\n\n378  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  iv.  and  wherefore  is  the  help  of  grace  conferred;  but \n\nbecause   Freewill   can   do   nothing,  and,  as  this \n\nvery  Diatribe  has  affirmed,  in  that  approvable \nopinion  of  hers,  cannot  will  good?  When  grace \ntherefore  is  extolled,  and  the  help  of  grace  is \nproclaimed,  the  impotenc}^  of  Freewill  is  in  the \nsame  instant  proclaimed.  This  is  that  sound  con- \nclusion, and  that  legitimate  consequence,  which \nnot  even  the  gates  of  hell  shall  overthrow. \nsect.  Here  I  make  an  end  of  maintaining  my  own  texts \nagainst  Diatribe's  confutation  of  them,  that  my \nbook  may  not  grow  to  an  immoderate  size  :  the \nrest  (if  there  be  any  worth  noticing)  shall  be  con- \nsidered in  the  assertion  of  my  own  sentiment. \nAs  to  what  Erasmus  repeats  in  his  Epilogue,  that,  if \nour  sentiment  stand,  there  are  never  so  many  pre- \ncepts, never  so  many  threatenings,  never  so  many \npromises  all  made  vain;  there  is  no  place  left  either \nfor  merit,  or  demerit,  for  reward,  or  for  punish- \nment— then  again,  that  it  is  difficult  to  defend  the \nmercy,  or  even  the  justice  of  God,  if  God  con- \ndemns those  who  sin  necessarily — and  other  dis- \nagreeable consequences,  which  have  so  moved  the \ngreatest  men  as  to  overthrow  them — \n\nI  have  given  an  answer  to  all  these  considera- \ntions already.  Nor  do  I  either  tolerate,  or  receive, \nthat  golden  mean  which  advises,  with  good  inten- \ntion, as  I  am  willing  to  suppose,  that  we  should \nconcede  a  very  small  degree  of  power  to  Freewill, \nin  order  that  the  inconsistency  of  Scripture,  and \nthe  forementioned  inconveniences,  may  the  more \neasily  be  removed.  The  truth  is,  this  golden  mean \nneither  assists  the  cause  which  it  is  meant  to \nserve,  nor  gets  us  any  forwarder  in  the  solution  of \ndifficulties.  Unless  you  yield  the  whole  and  every \nthing  to  Freewill,  as  the  Pelagians  do,  there  still \nremains  inconsistency  in  the  Scriptures,  merit  and \nreward  are  excluded,  the  mercy  and  justice  of  God \nare  abrogated,  and  all  those  inconveniences  which \nwe  aim  to  avoid  by  allowing  a  very  small  and \n\n\nTEXTS  AGAINST  FREEWILL  MAINTAINED.  379 \n\ninefficacious  power  to  Freewill  remain  in  force ;     s^ct. \nas  I  have  already  shewn.  We  must  therefore  come  * \n\nto  the  extremity  of  denying  Freewill  altoge- \nther, and  referring  every  thing  to  God  ;  and \nthen  we  shall  find  that  the  Scriptures  are  not \ninconsistent  with  themselves,  and  that  our  in- \nconveniences are  either  removed  or  rendered \ntolerable. \n\nThere  is  one  thing,  however,  which  I  depre- \ncate, my  Erasmus,  and  that  is,  your  persuading \nyourself  that  I  plead  this  cause  with  more  of  zeal \nthan  of  judgment.  I  cannot  endure  that  I  should  be \ncharged  with  such  hypocrisy  as  to  think  one  thing \nand  write  another  :  nor  is  it  true  what  you  write \nof  me,  that  I  have  been  carried  forwards  by  the \nheat  of  self-defence  to  the  point  of  now  for  the \nfirst  time  denying  Freewill  wholly,  whereas  I  had \nhitherto  ascribed  something  to  it.  You  will  not \nshew  this  something,  I  well  know,  in  any  of  my \npublications.  There  are  theses  and  questions  of \nmine  extant,  in  which  I  have  been  perpetually \nasserting,  up  to  this  very  hour,  that  Freewill  is  a \nnothing,  and  a  matter  of  mere  name;  such  was \nthe  term  which  I  then  used  about  it.  Overcome \nby  truth  ;  provoked  and  compelled  by  disputa- \ntion ;  thus  I  have  been  brought  to  think,  and  thus \nI  have  been  brought  to  write.  That  I  have  discussed \nthe  matter  with  a  considerable  degree  of  vehemence, \nif  it  be  a  crime,  is  a  crime  to  which  I  plead \nguilty  :  nay,  it  is  my  marvellous  joy,  that  this  tes- \ntimony should  be  borne  to  me  by  the  world,  in  the \ncause  of  God.  May  God  himself  confirm  this  tes- \ntimony in  the  last  day  !  So  shall  none  be  then  more \nblessed  than  Luther ;  who  is  so  greatly  extolled \nby  the  testimony  of  his  own  age  as  one  that  hath \nnot  pleaded  the  cause  of  truth  sluggishly  or  deceit- \nfully, but  with  a  high  degree,  it  may  be  with  an \nexcess  of  vehemence.  Then  shall  I  happily  escape \nthat  judgment  spoken  of  by  Jeremiah  :  Cursed  is \n\n\n380  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL; \n\npart  iv.  the  man  who  cloeth  the  work  of  the  Lord  negli- \n\ngently.™ \n\nNow  if  I  shall  also  seem  a  little  severe  upon \nyour  Diatribe,  you  must  pardon  me.  It  is  not \nfrom  ill-will  to  you  that  I  am  so  :  but  I  have  been \nstirred  up  to  it,  by  the  conviction  that  you  were \nmightily  depressing  this  cause,  which  is  the  cause \nof  Christ,  by  your  authority;  whilst  your  know- \nledge and  the  matter  you  put  forth11  are  not  such  as \nto  entitle  you  to  any  superior  consideration. — \nAnd  then,  who  has  such  a  command  of  temper \nevery  where,  as  not  in  some  places  to  grow  warm? \nYour  desire  of  moderation  has  made  you  almost \ncold  as  ice  in  this  treatise;  but  you  not  unfre- \nquently  contrive  to  hurl  fiery  and  exceeding \nbitter  darts,  so  as  to  seem  absolutely  virulent  to \nyour  reader,  except  he  regard  you  with  peculiar \nfavour  and  indulgence.  But  all  this  has  nothing  to \ndo  with  the  cause :  we  ought  to  forgive  these \nasperities  mutually,  seeing  we  are  but  men,  and \nnothing  different  from  humanity  is  found  in  us.° \n\nm  Negligenter.~\\  Our  version  says  deceitfully,  but  has  neg- \nligently in  the  margin. \n\nu  Re  ipsd.~\\  '  The  material  which  he  worked  up  :'  as  dis- \ntinguished not  only  from  his  name,  but  from  the  dress  of \nlanguage  which  he  put  upon  it. \n\n°  Nihil  humani  alienum.']  '  Homo  sum,  nihil  a  me  humani \nalienum  puto,'  has  furnished  Luther  with  a  sentiment  which \nrequires  a  little  correction.  As  a  called  child  of  God  he  had \nsurely  something  in  him  more  than  human. — He  only  means \nto  make  full  confession  of  his  humanity — and  that  another \nname  for  sin  of  all  kinds. \n\n\n381"

But \nI  shall  not  produce  them  all;  for  who  could  do \nthis  in  a  small  work,  when  the  whole  Scripture  is \non  my  side,  every  point  and  letter  of  it.  Nor \nis  there  any  need  to  do  so,  since  Freewill  has \nalready  been  vanquished  and  laid  prostrate  by \na  twofold  victory;  vanquished,  by  my  having \nproved  that  all  is  against  her,  which  she  thought \nwas  for  her ;  vanquished  again,  by  my  having \nshewn  that  all  those  proofs  which  she  had  a  mind \nto  confute  remain  still  invincible.  Besides,  even \nif  she  were  not  already  vanquished,  it  were \nenough  that  she  should  be  prostrated  by  one  or \ntwo  lances.  For  what  need  is  there,  when  an \nenemy  has  been  slain  by  some  single  weapon,  to \npierce  him  through  and  through  as  he  lies  dead, \nwith  many  more.  I  shall  therefore  be  short  now, \nif  the  subject  will  allow  me;  and  out  of  the  vast \nvariety  of  armies,  which  I  might  lead  forth  into \nthe  field,  I  shall  summon  two  general  officers \nonly,  with  a  select  portion  of  their  legions  :  these \nare  Paul  and  John  the  Evangelist. \n\nPaul,    writing    to    the    Romans,    thus    enters   sectii. \n\nupon  his  argument  in  behalf  of  the  grace  of  God  \n\nagainst  Freewill.     \"  The  wrath  of  God,  says  he,  f™^ \n\n\n382  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL \n\npart  v.  is  revealed  from  heaven  upon  all  ungodliness  and \nunrighteousness  of  men,  who  hold  the  truth  in \nSentence  unrighteousness.\"  Jn  these  words  you  hear  a \nupon  Free-  general  sentence  pronounced  upon  all  men,  that \nwllL  they  are  under  the  wrath  of  God.     What  is  this \n\nelse,  but  that  they  are  worthy  of  wrath  and  punish- \nment? He  assigns  as  the  cause  of  this  anger,  that \nthey  do  nothing  but  what  is  worthy  of  wrath  and \npunishment ;  that  all,  forsooth,  are  ungodly  and  un- \njust, and  hold  the  truth  in  unrighteousness.  Where \nnow  is  that  power  of  Freewill  which  endeavours \nafter  something  good  ?  Paul  represents  it  to  be \ndeserving  of  the  wrath  of  God,  and  passes  sen- \ntence upon  it  as  ungodly  and  unjust.  Nov/  that \nwhich  is  ungodly,  and  deserves  wrath,  endea- \nvours and  hath  power,  not  for  grace,  but  against \nit.a \n\nLuther  will  be  laughed  at  here  for  his  careless- \nness, as  not  having  examined  Paul's  text  suffi- \nciently; and  some  will  say,  that  Paul  does  not \nspeak  of  all  men,  nor  of  all  their  endeavours,  in \nthis  passage,  but  only  of  those  who  are  ungodly \nand  unjust:  of  those,  as  his  words  express  it, \nwho  detain  the  truth  in  unrighteousness;  and  so \nit  does  not  follow  that  all  are  of  this  character. \nUpon  which  I  remark,  that  with  Paul  it  is  the \nsame  thing  to  say,  c  upon  all  ungodliness  of  men,' \nas  to  say,  6  upon  the  ungodliness  of  all  men ;' \nfor  Paul  hebraizes  almost  every  where  :b  so  that \nhis  meaning  is,  '  all  men  are  ungodly  and  unjust, \nand  detain  the  truth  in  unrighteousness;  there- \nfore all  men  are  worthy  of  wrath.'  Besides,  it  is \nnot  the  relative  that  is  used  in  the  Greek  text — \n\na  Luther's  argument  is,  '  Paul  declares  that  wrath  is \nrevealed  upon  \"  all  men.\"  If  so,  it  is  revealed  upon  Free- \nwill.— His  labour  therefore  is  to  shew  that  this  text  means \nso  much. — That  it  does  mean  so  much  is  shewn,  1.  From  the \nvery  words.     2.  From  the  preceding  context. \n\nb  Ebralcatur .]  I  should  not  say  '  hebraizes'  here  \\  for  it  is \nGreek  as  well  as  Hebrew — perhaps  nearly  all  languages — thus \nto  speak  :  grammarians  call  it  Hyperbaton. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  383 \n\nof  those  who — but  the  article ;  as  thus,  c  The  SECT  n- \nwrath  of  God  is  revealed  upon  the  ungodliness \nand  injustice  of  men,  detaining  as  they  do  the \ntruth  in  unrighteousness/ — So  that  this  is  a  sort \nof  epithet  applied  to  all  men,  (  That  they  detain \nthe  truth  in  unrighteousness :'  just  as  it  is  an \nepithet  when  it  is  said,  e  Our  Father  which  art  in \nheaven;'  which  might  otherwise  be  expressed \nthus,  c  Our  heavenly  Father/  or  '  Our  Father  in \nthe  heavens/0  For  the  expression  is  used  to  dis- \ntinguish them  from  those  who  believe  and  are \ngodly. \n\nBut  let  these  suggestions  be  frivolous  and  vain, \nif  the  very  thread  of  Paul's  argument  do  not  con- \nstrain and  prove  them.  He  had  said  just  before, \n\"  The  Gospel  is  the  power  of  God,  unto  salvation, \nto  every  one  that  believeth ;  to  the  Jew  first  and \nalso  to  the  Greek.\"  The  words  here  used  are  not \nobscure  or  ambiguous  :  c  To  the  Jews  and  to  the \n\nc  An  epithet  -which  implies  the  reason  of  the  Lord's  con- \nduct 5  and  which  I  should  venture  to  render  by  c  for  that  they \ndetain,  &c.'  in  Latin  '  utpote  qui ;'  '  seeing  that  they  are  those \nwho,  &c.' — I  do  not  agree  with  Luther  in  the  distinction \nwhich  he  here  understands  the  Apostle  to  make  :  I  consider \nhim  to  be  speaking  strictly  of  all  men  ;  even  as  he  is  proceed- \ning to  shew  that  all  men  without  exception  are  in  their  nature \nstate  chargeable  with  holding  the  truth  in  unrighteousness. \nIt  is  the  nature  state  of  man,  the  state  of  man  without  the \nGospel,  of  which  the  Apostle  treats  ;  till  he  comes  to  the \ntwenty-first  verse  of  the  third  chapter.  The  true  connection \nis,  I  shall  be  glad  to  come  to  Rome  ;  for  I  am  not  ashamed  of \nthe  Gospel ;  for  that  Gospel  is  the  power  of  God  unto  salva- \ntion -,  that  salvation  which  all  men  want ;  which  all  men  want \nbecause  the  wrath  of  God  is  revealed  upon  all  men  for  their \nungodliness  ;  for  their  ungodliness  and  unrighteousness,  be- \ncause they  hold  e  the  truth'  in  unrighteousness  ;  they  hold \nthe  truth  in  unrighteousness  because  God  has  made  him- \nself manifest  to  them,  but  they  have  not  dealt  with  him \naccording  to  that  manifestation.  His  great  charge  therefore, \nwhich  he  goes  on  to  maintain  against  man  universally — both \nJew  and  Gentile — considered  as  yet  without  the  preached \nGospel — is,  that  they  hold  the  truth  in  unrighteousness. — \nThis  account  of  the  context  does  not  at  all  invalidate  Luther's \napplication  of  the  text.  All  he  wants  is  c<  all  men  :\"  and  this \nhe  clearly  has. \n\n\n384  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v,  Greeks— that  is,  to  all  men— the  Gospel  of  the \npower  of  God  is  necessary,  in  order  that  be- \nlievers may  be  saved  from  the  wrath  which  is \nrevealed/  When  he  declares  the  Jews — who  ex- \ncelled other  nations  in  righteousness,  in  the  law \nof  God,  and  in  the  power  of  Freewill — to  be, \nwithout  any  difference,  both  destitute  of  the \npower  of  God  and  in  need  of  it,  that  they  may \nbe  saved  from  the  revealed  wrath — making  that \npower  necessary  to  them — does  he  not  reckon \nthem  to  be  under  wrath,  pray  ?  What  men  will  you \nassume  to  be  unobnoxious  to  the  wrath  of  God, \nwhen  you  are  compelled  to  believe  that  the \ngreatest  men  in  the  world — the  Jews  and  the \nGreeks  for  instance— are  not  so  ?  Agam ;  whom \nwill  you  except  amidst  those  Jews  and  Greeks, \nwhen  Paul  embraces  them  all  without  any  dis- \ntinction under  one  name,  and  subjects  them  all  to \nthe  same  sentence?  Is  it  to  be  supposed,  that \nthere  were  no  individuals  in  these  two  most  emi- \nnent nations/  who  strove  after  honesty?6  Were \nthere  none  that  endeavoured,  to  the  uttermost  of \nFreewill  ?  Yet  Paul  does  not  heed  this  at  all ; \nhe  sends  all  under  wrath ;  he  pronounces  all  un- \ngodly and  unjust.  Must  we  not  suppose,  that \nthe  rest  of  the  Apostles  also  did,  by  a  like  sen- \ntence, cast  all  the  other  nations  also,  and  each \nindividual   of  them  in   his  lot,   as   one  mass  of \n\nd  Istis  duabus.\"]  I  should  rather  understand  the  Greeks  in \nthis  connection  to  be  the  representatives  of  the  Gentile  world, \nselected  as  the  most  favourable  or  enlightened  specimen  of  it  j \nJew  and  Greek,  like  Jew  and  Gentile,  comprehending  the \nwhole  human  race.  Luther  understands  Paul  to  express  that \nnation  in  its  individuality,  and  argues  by  induction  thence  to \nthe  rest  of  the  nations. — The  frequent  use  of  this  antithesis — \nJew  and  Greek — favours  my  view  :  but  Luther's  argument  is \nnot  affected  by  the  distinction.  His  refined  Greek  is  included \namongst  my  promiscuous  Gentiles. \n\ne  Qui  ad  honesta  niterentur.~\\  Referring  to  Erasmus's  noble \ndefence  of  the  heathens  and  their  philosophers,  as  such  great \nsticklers  and  striversfor  the  e honestum.'

He  represents  believers  as \nrighteous,  unbelievers  as  ungodly,   unrighteous, \nand  subject  to  wrath.     For  all  he  means  to  say \nis,  '  the  righteousness  of  God  is  revealed  in  the \nGospel,  that  it  is  of  faith :'  therefore  all  men  are \nungodly  and    unrighteous ;    seeing   it   would  be \nfoolish  in  God  to  reveal  righteousness  to  men, \nwhich  they  either  knew,  or  possessed  the  seeds  of \nalready.     But  seeing  that  God  is  no  fool,  and  jet \nhe   reveals   a  righteousness   of  salvation;    it   is \nmanifest   that  Freewill,   even  in  the  chiefest  of \nmen,  not  only  has  nothing  and  can  do  nothing, \nbut  does  not  even  know  what  is  just  in  the  sight \nof  God.    Unless  you  shall  choose  to  say,  that  the \nrighteousness  of  God  is  not  revealed   to  those \nchiefest  of  men,  but  only  to  the  baser  sort;  in \nopposition  to  PauPs  boast,  that  he  is  a  debtor  to \nthe  Jew  and  to  the  Greek,  to  the  wise  and  to  the \nunwise,  to  the  barbarian  and  to  the  Greek. f     So \nthen  Paul,  comprehending  all  men  without  ex- \nception in  one  mass  here,  concludes  that  all  of \nthem  are  ungodly,  unjust,  and  ignorant  of  righte- \nousness and  faith ;    so  far  are  they  from  being \n\nf  The  allusion  is  to  Romans  i.  14. — I  do  not  find  any  text  in \nwhich  he  speaks  of  himself  as  debtor  to  Jews  and  Greeks. \nLuther  seems  to  have  confounded  the  fourteenth  verse  with \nthe  sixteenth,  and  with  some  expressions  in  Rom.  ii.  1  Cor.  i. \nGalat.  iii.

Look  at   the  Jews, \ncontinually  taught  as  they  have  been  by  so  many \nmiracles,  by  so  many  Prophets ;  what  do  they \nthink  of  this  way  ?

And  yet  who  would  dare  to \nsay  that  there  hath  not  been  a  single  individual \nin  such  a  multitude  of  people,  who  hath  cultivated \nhis  free  will,  and  endeavoured  to  effect  something \nby  its  power  ?     How  comes  it  then,  that  all  men \ntry  after  something  different  from  this,  and  that \nthe  most  excellent  of  the  most  excellent  of  men \nhave  not  only  neglected  to  cultivate  this  method \nof  righteousness,  yea,   and  been  ignorant  of  it ; \nbut,  when  now  it  has  been  published  and  re- \nvealed, have  repelled  it  with  the  most  consum- \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  387 \n\nmate  hatred,  and  have  been  eager  to  destroy  it  ?  sect.  iv. \n\nSo  that  Paul,  in  1  Cor.  i.  declares  this  way  to  be  \n\nto  the  Jews  a  stumbling-block,  and  to  the  Gen- \ntiles foolishness. \n\nNow,  since  he  makes  mention  of  Gentiles  and \nJews  indiscriminately,  and  since  it  is  certain  that \nthe  Jews  and  the  Gentiles  are  the  chief  people \nunder  heaven ;  it  is  at  the  same  time  certain,  that \nFreewill  is  nothing  but  the  chiefest  enemy  of \nrighteousness  and  of  man's  salvation ;  because  it \ncannot  be,  but  that  some  amongst  these  Jews  and \nGentiles  have  acted  and  endeavoured  with  the \nuttermost  power  of  Freewill;  and  yet  with  this \nvery  Freewill  have  done  nothing  but  wage  war \nagainst  grace.  Go  now,  and  say  that  Freewill \nendeavours  after  good,  when  goodness  and  righte- \nousness itself  is  a  stumbling-block  and  foolishness \nto  her  !  Nor  can  you  say  that  this  saying  per- \ntains to  some,  but  not  to  all.  Paul  speaks  indis- \ncriminately of  all,  when  he  says,  \"  to  the  Gentiles \nfoolishness,  and  to  the  Jews  a  stumbling-block;\" \nexcepting  none  but  those  that  believe.  \"  To  us, \nsays  he ;  that  is,  to  the  called  and  sanctified ;  he \nis  the  power  and  wisdom  of  God.\"  He  does  not \nsay,  e  to  some  Gentiles,  to  some  Jews/  but  sim- \nply, c  to  the  Gentiles  and  to  the  Jews  who  are  not \nof  us' — making  a  division,  which  is  very  plain, \nbetween  the  believing  and  the  unbelieving,  and \nleaving  not  a  single  individual  in  the  midway \nbetween  the  two.  Now  we  are  talking  about \nGentiles  who  have  not  the  grace  of  God  :  Paul \nsays  that  the  righteousness  of  God  is  foolishness \nto  them,  and  they  abhor  it !  So  much  for  this \nlaudable  endeavour  of  Freewill  after  good.s \n\ns  Luther's  account  of  this  text  is,  1.  The  words  are  a  testis \nmony.  2.  This  testimony  is  confirmed  by  (1.)  the  preceding \ncontext  (2.)  fact  and  experience. — I  deem  him  mistaken  in \nhis  view,  both  of  the  text  and  context.  (See  above,  note  c.)  The \ntext  does  not  refer  to  '  the  truth'  as  preached  by  the  Gospel, \nneither  does  it  make  any  division  or  exception.     It  is  the \n\n2c2 \n\n\n388 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n\npart  v.

Luther  was  misled,  possibly,  by  the \nword  '  truth  ;'  \"  who  hold  the  truth  in  unrighteousness  ;\"  as  if \nit  must  necessarily  mean  the  Gospel.  What,  is  there  no  teacher \nof  truth  but  the  Gospel  ?  and  is  '  the  truth'  identical  with  the \n\n\nGospel \n\n\nThe  truth\"  is  either  '  the  substance  of  God,'  *  or \n\n\n'  the  doctrine  of  that  substance' — what  states  it  out ;  and  con- \nsequently, what  states  out  or  displays  any  part  of  this — so  far  as \nit  does  state  this  out — may  in  this  inferior  sense  (I  call  doctrine \nof  or  about  the  reality  inferior  to  the  reality  itself)  be \ncalled  '  the  truth.'  Now  some  of  the  invisible  things  of  God \nwere  thus  shewn,  or  stated  out,  in  creation  ;  and  are  shewn \nby  what  we  call  the  works  of  nature  (that  is,  works  of  God  in \ncreation  as  distinguished  from  those  of  super-creation  or  re- \ndemption.) So  that  those  who  had  not  the  Gospel  might  still \nbe  charged  with  holding  the  truth  in  unrighteousness  :  they \nhad  it,  and  did  not  act  it. — That  this  is  Paul's  reference  and \nmeaning  here,  appears  from  what  follows.  He  goes  on  to  say, \n(f  Because  that  which  may  be  known  of  God  is  manifest  in \nthem  j  for  God  hath  shewed  it  unto  them.  For  the  invisi- \nble things  of  him  from  the  creation  of  the  world  are  clearly \nseen,  being  understood  by  the  things  that  are  made,  even  his \neternal  power  and  Godhead  :  so  that  they  are  without  excuse.\" \nHe  then  sets  out  the  conduct  of  the  Gentiles  under  this  know- \nledge, having  thus  previously  shewn,  that  if  they  sinned,  it \nwas  without  excuse. — Luther  is  guilty  here  of  the  very  error \nwhich  he  charges  upon  Erasmus  in  Part.  iv.  Sect,  xxx.,  that  of \nassuming  parallelisms  without  proof :  because  Jew  and  Greek \nare  opposed  in  1  Cor.  i.,  and  also  here,  he  assumes  that  it \nmust  be  with  just  the  same  reference  and  scope  in  each  ; \nwhereas  it  is  there  the  rejecting  infidel,  here  the  un-evangelized \nneglecter  and  contemner  of  God,  that  is  the  subject  of  re- \nmark.— Still  the  testimony  against  Freewill  is  entire.  Even \nthe  conclusion  from  the  sixteenth  verse,  and  from  the  seven- \nteenth verse,  is  not  abated  :  \"  The  Gospel  is  the  power  of \nGod  unto  salvation  to  every  one  that  believeth  ;  to  the  Jew \nfirst,  and  also  to  the  Greek  3\"  therefore  both  Jew  and  Greek \nneedeth  salvation — therefore  they  neither  liave,  nor  know  it \nby  Freewill.  i(  Therein  is  the  righteousness  of  God  revealed \nfrom  faith  to  faith  5\"  therefore  righteousness  is  not  known \nwithout  it — is  not   known  by  Freewill  5  it  is  by  faith — and \n\n*  I  do  not  forget  that  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  is  hoth  personally  and  mysti- \ncally called  the  truth  ;  but  if  this  title  be  examined,  it  will  be  found  that \nHe  has  it,  in  both  these  regards,  sulordinately ;  --as  the  grand  Displayer, \nDeclarer,  Word,  and  Glory  of  God  the  Father — the  created  image  of  the \nUncreated  Reality. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  389 \n\nof  Lis  assertion,  when  he  says  that  the  more  wise  sect.  v. \n\nof  them  were  made  foolish,  and  their  heart  was \n\ndarkened  :  also  that  that  they  were  made  vain  by  ™™^stth0ef \ntheir  reasonings;  that  is,  by  their  wily  disput-  theGreeks, \nations.11  and  afteor-- \n\nWhat,  does  he  not  here  lay  his  hands  upon  aemnsX \nwhat  is  highest  and  most  excellent  amongst  the  Jewsindis- \nGreeks,  when  he  lays  hold  of  their  reasonings  ?  j™: \nThese  are  their  highest  and  best  thoughts  and \nopinions,  which    they   accounted   solid   wisdom. \nBut  this  wisdom,  which  he  elsewhere  calls  foolish \nin   them,1   he    here    calls    vain;   and    says,   that \nwith   much    endeavouring    it    got    from   bad   to \nworse  :  so  that  at  length  their  heart  was  darkened, \n\nthat  faith  is  not  of  Freewill,,  but  opposed  to  it. — But  what  says \nthe  text  itself  in  its  grammatical  sense  as  led  to  and  supported \nby  a  just  view  of  the  context  ?  '  The  wrath  of  God  is  revealed \nagainst  all  men  in  their  nature  state,  for  that  they  hold  the \ntruth  in  unrighteousness  :  they  manifest  themselves  to  be \nwhat  they  are — children  of  wrath  and  curse,  through  original \nsin  and  guilt — by  blinding  themselves  to  that  display  of  God \nwhich  is  made  by  the  visible,  and  otherwise  sensible,  things  of \nhis  hand.' \n\nh  Luther  does  not  quote  the  words  in  the  order  in  which  we \nhave  them  in  our  version,  and  in  which  they  stand  in  the  ori- \nginal text.  \"  Because  that,  when  they  knew  God,  they  glo- \nrified him  not  as  God,  neither  were  thankful :  but  became  vain \nin  their  imaginations,  and  their  foolish  heart  was  darkened. \nProfessing  themselves  to  be  wise,  they  became  fools,  and \nchanged  the  glory  of  the  uncorruptible  God,  &c.\" — I  doubt  the \npropriety  of  Luther's  distinction  here  between  the  wiser  of \nthem,  and  the  rest  of  the  nation.  He  appears  to  have  understood \nthe  words  '  (pdo-KOPTes  eJimc  aocpolS  as  expressing  those  who \nsaid  they  were  wise  amongst  them.  But  there  is  nothing  par- \ntitive in  the  form  here.  It  is  a  description  applied  to  the  persons \nof  whom  he  had  spoken  in  the  preceding  verse,  and  of  whom \nhe  continues  to  speak  in  the  following  verses.  The  whole \nnation,  which  Avas  a  refined  and  philosophical  nation,  boasted \nitself  of  its  wisdom.  The  philosophers  led  the  way  in  much \nof  the  idolatry  and  sin,  but  the  people  followed  them  j  and \nit  is  of  the  whole,  inclusively  but  not  exclusively  of  the  philo- \nsophers, that  the  Apostle  delivers  his  testimony.  Luther's \nargument,  however,  is  not  affected  by  this  distinction ;  he  only \nwants  to  have  it  secured  that  the  greatest  and  best  of  their \ncommunity  are  comprehended  in  the  censure. \n\n1  1  Cor.  hi,  18—20. \n\n\n390  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npautv.  and  they  worshipped  idols,  and  performed  the \nmonstrous  acts  which  he  records  in  the  follow- \ning verses. k  If  the  best  endeavours  and  per- \nformance, then,  in  the  best  of  the  Gentiles  be  evil \nand  wicked;  what  do  you  think  of  the  remaining \nmultitude?  being,  as  they  were,  even  a  worse  sort \nof  heathens.  For  neither  here  again  does  he \nmake  any  difference  between  the  better  sort; \nwhilst  without  any  respect  of  persons  he  con- \ndemns their  search  after  wisdom.  Now,  when \nthe  very  act  or  endeavour  is  condemned,  the \nendeavourers,  whosoever  they  be,  are  condemned \nalso,  although  they  may  have  done  what  they  did \nwith  the  uttermost  might  of  Freewill.  Their  very \nbest  effort,  I  say,  is  declared  to  be  faulty ;  how \nmuch  more  the  persons  employed  in  it ! \n\nPresently  he  in  like  manner  rejects  the  Jews \nalso  without  any  distinction,  as  being  Jews  in \nthe  letter  and  not  in  the  spirit.  u  Thou,  by \nthe  letter  and  circumcision,  dishonourest  God,\" \nsays  he.  And  again  ;  u  For  he  is  not  a  Jew  who \nis  a  Jew  openly,  but  who  is  a  Jew  secretly.\" — \nWhat  can  be  plainer  than  this  division?  The \noutside  Jew  is  a  transgressor  of  the  law.  But \nhow  many  Jews  were  there,  think  you,  who  had \nno  faith,  men  of  the  greatest  wisdom,  devotion \nand  honesty,  who  strove  after  justice  and  truth \nwith  the  greatest  earnestness  of  endeavour  ? \nJust  as  he  often  bears  them  record,  that  they  have \na  zeal  for  God,  that  they  follow  after  the  righte- \nousness of  the  law,  that  they  are  labouring  day \nand  night  to  obtain  salvation,  that  they  live \nblameless  ! 1   And  yet  they  are  transgressors  of  the \n\nk  Sequentia  monstra,  quce.']  The  form  is  ambiguous  ;  it  might \nexpress  that  their  horrific  abominations  were  the  natural  con- \nsequence of  their  idolatries  :  which  is  true,,  though  I  do  not \nconsider  him  as  affirming  it.  The  form  as  I  have  rendered  it, \nthough  not  grammatical,  is  common. \n\n1  Quod  sine  quereld  vivantJ]  Ambiguous — might  mean  with- \nout a  murmur — but  seems  clearly  to  refer  to  such  passages  as \nPhilipp.  iii.  6.

What  remains  then,  but  that  Freewill \nis  the  worst  when  it  is  best,  and  the  more  it \nendeavours  the  worse  it  is  made.  The  words \nare  clear,  the  division  is  one  which  admits  of \nno  doubt,  there  is  not  any  thing  which  can  be \ncontroverted. \n\nBut  let  us  hear  Paul  himself  in  the  character  Paul's  epi- \nof  his  own  interpreter.     Making  a  sort  of  epi-  losue. \nloguem  to   his    argument,  in   chap.  iii.  he  says,  h^meL!8 \n\"What  then?  do  we  excel  them?

They  did  not  really  fulfil  the  commandment \nany  more  than  they  entered  into  the  spirit  of  the  ritual.  The \nreal  Jew,  the  spiritual  Israelite,  was  enlightened  by  the  Holy \nGhost  to  see,  understand,  receive,  use  and  enjoy  Christ  in \nboth,  by  faith  •  having  faith  bestowed  upon  him,  by  an  exercise \nof  grace  which  was  distinct  from  and  beyond  his  covenant. \n(See  above,  Part  iii.  Sect,  xxviii.  note  v.)  But  the  others  were \ntransgressors  of  the  law,  not  because  they  had  not  faith :  ' '  For \nthe  law  is  not  of  faith  ;  but  the  man  that  doeth  them  shall  live \nin  them.\"  (Galat.  iii.  12.)  One  of  the  objects  proposed  by  the \nlaw  was  to  make  them  superabounding  transgressors  (Rom. \nv.  20.)  ;  and  they  were  constituted  such,  not  by  lack  of  faith \nin  Christ,  but  by  lack  of  spiritual  obedience  to  its  spiritual \nrequirements.  Luther  confounds  Law  and  Gospel  here  :  the \nspirit-faith,  of  Abraham  with  the  /eJfer-morality  of  Moses  !  It \nsuits  his  view  of  the  Apostle's  argument  5  but  that  view  is \nincorrect.  (See  above,  Sect.  ii.  note  c.)  The  Apostle  is  shew- \ning that  the  law-having  Jew  is  no  better  than  the  uncove- \nnanted  Gentile  :  iC  but  if  thou  be  a  breaker  of  the  law,  thy  cir- \ncumcision is  made  uncircumcision.\"  (Rom.  ii.  25.) \n\nm  Velut  epilogum  faeiens.~\\  Epil.

What  is  become  of  Freewill  now?     All  Jews \n\nand  Greeks,  says  he,  are  under  sin.     Are  there \n\nany  tropes,  or  knots  here  ?  What  can  a  qualified \ninterpretation,  in  which  the  whole  world  should \njoin,  avail  against  this  sentence  which  is  so  plain? \nHe  who  says  '  all'  excepts  none.  He  who  lays \nit  down  that  they  are  under  sin  ;  that  is,  servants \nof  sin,  leaves  nothing  good  in  them.  But  where  has \nhe  preferred  this  charge  that  all  the  Jews  and \nthe  G  entiles  are  under  sin  ?  Nowhere  else,  save \nwhere  I  have  shewn  that  he  does  so ;  that  is, \nwhen  he  says,  \"  The  wrath  of  God  is  revealed \nfrom  heaven  upon  all  ungodliness  and  unrighte- \nousness of  men.\"  In  the  words  which  follow  he \nproves  this  by  experience;  for  that  they,  being \ndispleasing  to  God,  were  subjected  to  so  many- \nvices,  being  convicted  as  it  were  by  the  fruits  of \ntheir  ungodliness,  that  they  will  and  do  nothing \nbut  evil.0  He  then  enters  into  judgment  with  the \nJews  separately,  charging  the  Jew  with  being  a \ntransgressor  of  the  letter;  and  this  he  in  like \nmanner  proves  by  their  fruits,  and  by  experience  : \n\"  Thou  preachest  that  man  should  not  steal,  and \nstealest.  Thou  abhorrest  idols,  and  committest \nsacrilege ;\"  excepting  none,  unless  they  be  in \nspirit  Jews.  Nor  have  you  any  outlet  of  escape \nhere,  by  saying,  '  Although  they  be  under  sin, \nstill  what  is  best  in  them,  as  reason  and  will,  has \nendeavour  towards  good:'  for,  if  good  endeavour \nbe  remaining  in  them,  his  assertion  that  they  are \nunder  sin  is  false.  For  when  he  specifies  Jews \nand  Gentiles,  he  by  that  mention  comprehends \nwhatsoever  is  in  Jews  and  Gentiles :  unless  you \nwould  invert  his  words,  and  suppose  him  to  have \n\nword  occurs.  Paul  enters  forthwith  into  proof  5  which  looks'as \nif  he  considered  what  had  preceded  as  little  more  than  laying  a \ncharge. — Some  MSS.  read  the  simple  verb  yTtaa.  which  Luther \nseems  to  have  followed. \n\n0  Velutfructibusimpietatisconvicti^]  Their  abandonment  of  God, \nunder  which  they  did  such  vile  things,  proved  what  they  were, \nwith  respect  to  God,  who  had  been  provoked  to  give  them  up. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  393 \n\nwritten,  '  The  flesh  of  all  Jews  and  Greeks'— that  sec.  vn. \n\nis,  their  grosser  affections — '  are  under  sin/    But  \n\nthe  wrath  of  God,  which  is  revealed  from  heaven \nupon  them,  will  condemn  their  whole  substance  ; \nexcept  they  be  justified  by  the  Spirit :  and  this \nwould  not  be  so  unless  their  whole  substance \nwere  under  sin. \n\nBut  let  us  see  how  Paul  proves  his  sentiment  Pauljusti- \nfrom  the  Scriptures ;  whether  the  words  are  more  fied  m  his \nto  the  point  as  we  read  them  in  Paul,  than  as  we  qu°  ai° \nread  them  in  their  own  places.    \"  As  it  is  written, \nsays  he  ;  for  there  is  none  righteous,  no  not  one  ; \nthere  is  none  that  understandeth  :  there  is  none \nthat  seeketh  after  God.

Then  will  I  also  willingly  yield \nand  recant,  and  myself  become  a  confessor  and \nassertor  of  Freewill.  It  is  clear  these  things  are \nsaid  of  ail  men;  for  the  Prophet  introduces  God \nlooking  forth  upon  all  men,  and  pronouncing  this \nsentence  upon  them.  Thus  he  speaks  in  Psalm \nxiv.  \"  The  Lord  looked  forth  from  heaven  upon \nthe  sons  of  men,  to  see  if  there  were  any  that \nunderstandeth  or  seeketh  after  God.  But  they \nare  all  gone  out  of  the  way,  &c.\"  And  Paul  pre- \nvents the  Jews  from  thinking  that  these  things  do \nnot  belong  to  them,  by  asserting  that  they  do  espe- \ncially belong  to  them.  \"  We  know,  says  he, \nthat  whatsoever  the  law  saith,  it  saith  unto  them \nthat  are  under  the  law.\"  He  meant  the  same, \nwhere  he  said ;  \"  To  the  Jew  first,  and  also  to  the \nGreek.\" p \n\np  That  I  deny :  here  he  speaks  of  Jews  only ;  there,  by \nthe  combination  of  the  two  names  he  comprehended  all  men. \n\n\n394  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.       You  hear  therefore,  that  all  the  sons  of  men, \n\nall  who  are  under  the  law — that  is,  Gentiles  as \n\nwell  as  Jews — are  in  the  judgment  of  God  such \nas  be  unjust,  do  not  understand,  do  not  seek  after \nGod — no,  not  even  one  of  them — but  all  go  out  of \nthe  way,  and  are  unprofitable.  I  suppose  now,  that \namongst  the  sons  of  men,  and  those  who  be  under \nthe  law,  are  numbered  those  also  who  are  the \nbest  and  most  honourable ;  those  who  by  the \npower  of  Freewill  endeavour  after  what  is  honour- \nable and  good,  and  those  whom  Diatribe  makes \nher  boast  of,  as  having  the  sense  and  the  seeds  of \nhonesty  implanted  in  them :  unless,  peradventure, \nshe  maintain  that  those  are  sons  of  angels  ! q \n\nThe  very  force  of  the  argument  consists  in  its  exclusiveness. \nThe  Jews  would  say,  those  Scriptures  do  not  belong  to  us,  but \nto  the  heathens.  Nay,  says  he,  they  are  addressed  to  you  : \n<e  Whatsoever  the  law  saith,  it  saith  to  them  that  are  under \nthe  law,  that  every  mouth  may  be  stopped,  and  all  the  world \nmay  become  guilty  before  God.\"  Do  not  excuse  y ourselves  ; \nit  is  meant  for  you  chiefly.  Why  should  that  be  spoken  to  you, \nwhich  belongs  to  others,  but  not  to  you?  Your  excuse  therefore \ncannot  be  admitted. — It  is  a  common  and  current  mistake \nthat  the  law  was  given  to  every  body  :  given  to  Adam  in  cre- \nation, and  through  him  to  the  whole  race.  But  this  is  apocry- \nphal, and  not  canonical  Scripture.  It  was  never  given  but  to \nthe  Jews,  that  is,  to  the  church ;  the  elect  and  covenanted \nnation  of  Israel :  which  was  for  its  hour  (a  space  of  fifteen \nhundred  years)  the  visible  church  (even  as  the  whole  com- \nmunity of  professed  Christians  is  that  church  now) ;  which \nwas  the  type  of  the  church  of  the  first-born — the  true  church — \nand  in  which  the  several  and  individual  members  of  that  same \nchurch — the  people  of  God  during  that  period  existent  in  the \nflesh — were  chiefly,  if  not  exclusively,  gathered  into  realized \nunion  with  Christ. — Here  at  least,  it  is  plain  that  the  Apostle \ndistinguishes  between  the  two  parts  of  mankind — Jews  and \nheathens — by  means  of  this  badge.  If  the  rest  of  mankind \nbe  supposed  to  be  dealt  with  according  to  this  law,  and  as \nthough  they  were  under  it ;  tins  must  be  by  a  tacit  reference \nto  it  in  the  divine  mind,  not  on  the  ground  of  any  positive  and \nexpress  enactment  which  had  given  it  to  them  :  in  which  they \nare  plainly  differenced  from  the  Jews,  who  are  here  the  subjects \nof  remark. \n\ni  My  objection  with  respect  to  the  law  does  not  affect  the \nuniversality  of  the  charge.  Paul  is  dealing  with  a  Jewish \nobjector  :  with  respect  to  the  guilt  of  the  heathens  no  question \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  395 \n\nHow  can  those  endeavour  after  good  then,  who  sec.vii. \nare  all  universally  ignorant  of  God,  and  neither \ncare  for,  nor  seek  after  him  ?  How  can  those \npossess  a  power  which  is  profitable  for  good,  who \nall  turn  away  from  good,  and  are  altogether  un- \nprofitable ?  Do  we  not  know  what  this  meaneth — \nto  be  ignorant  of  God,  not  to  understand,  not  to \nseek  after  God,  not  to  fear  God,  to  turn  aside \nout  of  the  way,  and  to  be  unprofitable  ?  Are  not \nthe  words  most  plain,  and  do  they  not  teach  that \nall  men  are  both  ignorant  of  God  and  despise \nGod ;  and  then,  as  the  next  step,  turn  aside  to- \nwards evil,  and  are  unprofitable  for  good  ?  We \nare  not  talking  now  about  ignorance  in  seeking \nfood,  or  about  contempt  of  money;  but  about \nignorance  and  contempt  of  religion  and  piety  :  an \nignorance  and  contempt  which,  beyond  all  question, \nare  not  seated  in  the  flesh,  and  in  the  inferior  and \ngrosser  affections,  but  in  those  highest  and  most \nexcellent  powers  of  man  in  which  justice,  piety, \nthe  knowledge  and  the  reverence  of  God  ought  to \nreign ;  that  is,  in  the  rational  faculty  and  in  the \nwill — and  so,  in  the  very  power  of  Freewill  itself; \nin  the  very  seed  of  honesty,  or  in  the  very  heart \nof  that  which  is  most  excellent  in  man. \n\nWhere  art  thou  now,  my  Diatribe,  who  before \npromisedst,  that  thou  woulclest  willingly  agree,  as \nconcerning  the  most  excellent  thing  in  man,  that \nit  is  flesh — that  is,  ungodly — if  it  should  be \nproved  by  Scripture.  Agree  to  this  now  there- \nfore, hearing  as  you  do,  that  the  most  excellent \nthing  in  all  men  is  not  only  impious,  but  ignorant \nof  God,  a  contemner  of  God,  turned  towards \nevil,  and  unprofitable  as  to  good.  For  what  is  it \nto  be  unjust,  but  that  the  will,  which  is  one  of  the \nmost  excellent  things  in  man,  is  unjust?  What \nis  it  to  have  no  understanding  of  God  and  of \n\nis  entertained  :  the  Scriptures  which  he  quotes  have  esta- \nblished the  guilt  of  the  Jews  also.  He  has  therefore  made  good \nhis  charge,  that  f  all  men'  hold  the  truth  in  unrighteousness. \n\n\n396  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  good,  but  that  the  understanding,  which  is  another \n\nof  the  most  excellent  things  in  man,  is  ignorant \n\nof  God  and  of  good ;  that  is,  blind  to  the  know- \nledge of  godliness  ?  What  is  it  to  be  gone  out \nof  the  way,  and  to  be  unprofitable,  but  for  men \nnot  to  have  any  power  in  any  part  of  them — and \nleast  of  all  in  those  parts  of  them  which  are  most \nexcellent — to  do  good,  but  only  to  do  evil  ? \nWhat  is  it  not  to  fear  God,  but  for  men  in  all \nparts  of  them — and  especially  in  those  better  parts \nof  yours — to  be  despisers  of  God  ?  Now  to  be  de- \nspisers  of  God  is  to  be  at  the  same  time  despisers \nof  all  the  things  of  God  ;  for  instance,  of  the  words, \nworks,  laws,  precepts,  and  will  of  God.  Now \nwhat  can  the  understanding  dictate  that  is  right, \nwhen  she  is  herself  blind  and  ignorant  ?  What \ncan  the  will  choose  that  is  good,  when  she  is  her- \nself evil  and  unprofitable  ?  Nay,  what  can  the  will \nfollow  after,  when  the  understanding  dictates \nnothing  to  her,  save  the  darkness  of  her  own \nblindness  and  ignorance  ?  If  the  understanding \nthen  be  in  a  state  of  error,  and  the  will  in  a  state \nof  averseness,  what  good  can  the  man  either  do \nor  attempt  ? \nsec. vni.      But  some  one   may  perhaps  venture  upon  a \n\nsophistical  distinction,  and  say,  that,  although  the \n\nThe  Pro-     wj|j  ^urn  aside  and  the  understanding  be   igno- \n\nphet  s  con-  ~  ~ \n\ndemnation  rant  in   action,  the  will   notwithstanding  is  able \n\nincludes      t0  endeavour,  and  the  understanding  to  get  know- \n\nweHasact.  ledge,  by  their  own  powers  respectively:  seeing \n\nwe  have  power  to  do  many  things  which  we  do \n\nnot  however  actually  perform,  whilst  our  question \n\nforsooth  is  about  power,  not  performance. \n\nI  reply ;  the  words  of  the  Prophet  include  both \nact  and  power;  and  it  is  the  same  thing  to  say \n6  Man  does  not  seek  after  God/  as  it  would  be  to \nsay  c  Man  cannot  seek  after  God :'  an  assertion \nwhich  may  be  collected  hence ;  i  If  there  were  a \npower  or  force  in  man  to  will  good — seeing  he  is \nnot  suffered  to  rest,  or  take  his  pastime,  through \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  397 \n\nthe  impulse  of  the  divine  omnipotency,  as  I  have  sec.viii. \n\nshewn  above\" — it  could  not  be,  but  that  this  power  \n\nwere  moved  towards  something,  or  at  least  in  some \none  thing,  and  were  displayed  by  some  sort  of  use. \nThis  however  is  not  the  case;  because  God  looketh \ndown  from  heaven,  and  seeth  not  even  one  who \nseeks  after  him,or  endeavours.  It  follows  therefore, \nthat  this  power  which  endeavours,  or  is  willing \nto  seek  after  God,  is  nowhere  to  be  found;  but \nrather  all  men  go  out  of  the  way.  Again ;  if \nPaul  be  not  understood  to  speak  of  want  of \npower  as  well  as  want  of  act,  his  argument  would \navail  nothing.  His  whole  bent  is  to  prove  grace \nnecessary  to  all  men.  Now  if  men  could  begin \nany  thing  of  themselves,  grace  would  not  be \nnecessary.  But  as  it  is — since  they  cannot — \ngrace  is  necessary  to  them.  So  then  Freewill,  you \nperceive,  is  quite  eradicated  by  this  passage,  and \nnothing  of  goodness  or  honesty  is  left  in  man; \nhe  being  declared  to  be  unrighteous,  ignorant  of \nGod,  a  despiser  of  God,  averse  from  him,  and \nunprofitable  in  his  sight.  The  Prophet  is  a  pretty \nstrong  antagonist,  therefore,  in  his  own  text  as \nwell  as  under  Paul's :  allegation  of  him. — Nor  is \nit  a  small  matter,  when  man  is  said  to  be  igno- \nrant of  God,  and  to  despise  Him :  these  are  the \nfountains  of  all  wickednesses,  the  sink  of  sin,  yea, \nthe  very  hell  of  evil.  What  evil  will  be  left  un- \ndone, where  there  is  ignorance  and  contempt  of \nGod  ?  In  a  word,  the  empire  which  Satan  has \nin  men  could  not  have  been  described  in  fewer  or \nfuller  words,  than  by  his  calling  them  ignorant \nand  despisers  of  God.  In  this  is  included  un- \nbelief; in  this,  disobedience ;  in  this,  sacrilege  ; \nin  this,  blasphemy  towards  God ;  in  this,  cruelty \nand  want  of  compassion  towards  our  neighbour; \nin  this,  the  love  of  self  pervading  all  things  both \ndivine  and  human. \n\nr  See  above,  Part  iv.

Because  by  the  deeds  of  the \nlaw  is  no  flesh  justified  before  him.\" \n\nHow  is  every  mouth  stopped,  pray,  if  there \nstill  remains  a  power  in  us,  by  which  we  can  do \nsomething  ?  For  a  person  may  say  to  G  od,  '  It \nis  not  an  absolute  nothing  which  is  here  :  here  is \nsomething  which  you  cannot  condemn ;  seeing  it  is \nwhat  you  have  your  own  self  given  me,  that  it  might \nbe  able  to  do  something.  This  at  least  shall  not \nbe  silent,  nor  shall  it  be  guilty  before  thee.  If \nthis  power  of  Freewill  be  whole,  and  can  do  some- \nthing, it  is  false  that  the  whole  world  is  guilty,  or \nunder  charge  of  guilt  before  God; t  since  this  power \nis  no  small  thing,  nor  is  it  in  a  small  part  of  the \nworld,  but  is  in  all  the  world,  a  most  excellent \npossession  held  by  all  in  common,  whose  mouth \nought  not  to  be  stopped.  On  the  other  hand,  if  its \nmouth  ought  to  be  stopped,  then  must  it,  together \nwith  the  whole  world,  be  criminal  and  guilty  be- \nfore God.  But  with  what  right  shall  it  be  called \nguilty,  except  it  be  unrighteous  and  ungodly; \nthat  is,  worthy  of  punishment  and  vengeance  ? \nLet  her  look  to  it,  pray,  by  what  explanation \nthis  power  of  man's  is  absolved  from  the  guilt \nwith  which  the  whole  word  is  charged  at  the  suit \n\ns  I  object,  as  before,  to  Luther's  interpretation  of  this  text : \nit  is  the  Jews  of  whom  he  is  speaking,  not  of  the  best  and \nmost  excellent  of  men  generally.  These  testimonies  are \nborne  to,  and  concerning  Jews,  that  they  also  may  have  their \nmouths  stopped.  Of  the  Gentile  mouths  being  stopped  there \ncould  be  no  question,  and  was  none  with  the  Jews ;  though \nthey  shifted  off  their  own  charges  from  themselves  to  others. \nBut  the  argument,  again,  is  not  affected  by  this  distinction  : \nthe  whole  world  is  declared  guilty,  which  is  all  he  wants. \n\n1  Deo  obnoxius  seu  reus.']  v7t6£iko<$  rui  6ew.

What  bigger  words,  what  mightier  words, \ncould  be  uttered  than  these ;  the  whole  world  is \nguilty,  all  the  sons  of  men  are  turned  aside  and \nunprofitable,  none  feareth  God,  none  is  righteous, \nnone  under standeth,  none  seeketh  after  God  ? \nYet  such  hath  been,  and  still  is,  the  hardness \nand  insensible  obstinacy  of  the  human  heart,  that \nwe  neither  hear  nor  perceive  these  thunders  and \nlightnings,  but  join  in  extolling  and  asserting \nFreewill  and  its  powers  against  all  these,  so  as \ntruly  to  fulfil  that  saying  of  Malachi  i.  u  They \nbuild,  I  will  throw  down?\"v \n\nu  Qua  interp.  reata  obstfictus.']  Interp.

By  infer- \nence, their  whole  substance  and  all  its  affections  must  be \nbad ;  but  this  is  not  asserted.  Just  so,  in  the  last  section  ; \n1  Man  seeketh  not  after  God'  is  the  same  as  saying  c  Man \ncannot  seek  after  God  3'  which  he  proves  by  argument  and \ninference. \n\n\n400  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npartv.       There  is  the  same  bigness   of  speech  in  that \n\nsaying  also;   \"  By  the  deeds  of  the  law  no  flesh \n\nis  justified  before  him.\"  It  is  a  big  saying,  \"  By \nthe  deeds  of  the  law;\"  just  as  is  that  also,  (  The \nwhole  world /  or  that  e  All  the  sons  of  men/ — \nIt  is  observable,  that  Paul  abstains  from  speaking \nof  persons,  and  mentions  the  things  they  are \nseeking  after;  meaning,  forsooth,  to  involve  all \npersons,  and  whatsoever  is  most  excellent  in \nthem.  For  had  he  said,  c  the  common  people \namongst  the  Jews/  or  '  the  Pharisees/  or  '  some \nof  the  wicked/  are  not  justified;  he  might  seem \nto  have  left  some  out,  as  not  altogether  unpro- \nfitable, through  the  power  of  Freewill  and  the \npropping-up  of  the  law.  But  when  he  condemns \nthe  very  deeds  of  the  law,  and  makes  them \nwicked  before  God,  it  becomes  manifest  that  he \ncondemns  all  who  excelled  in  zeal  for  the  law \nand  its  deeds  :  and  yet  those  only  who  were  the \nbest  and  most  excellent  had  a  zeal  for  the  law  and \nits  deeds ;  and  that  only  in  the  best  and  most \nexcellent  parts  of  their  frames,  even  their  under- \nstanding and  their  will. \n\nIf  then,  those  who  exercised  themselves  in  the \nlaw  and  its  deeds  with  the  greatest  zeal  and \nendeavour  of  the  understanding  and  of  the  will — \nthat  is,with  the  whole  power  of  Freewill — and  were \neven  assisted  by  the  lawT  itself,  as  a  sort  of  divine \nhelper,  which  instructed  and  encouraged  them  ;  if \nthese  persons,  I  say,  be  charged  with  ungodli- \nness, in  that  they  are  said  not  to  be  justified,  but \nare  declared  to  be  flesh  in  the  sight  of  God — \nwhat  remains,  pray,  in  the  whole  human  race, \nwhich  is  not  flesh  and  ungodliness  ?  We  see  all \nalike  condemned,  who  are  of  the  deeds  of  the  law. \nWhether  they  exercise  themselves  with  the  great- \nest zeal,  or  with  moderate  zeal,  or  with  no  zeal  at \nall,  it  matters  not :  all  could  yield  but  a  perform- \nance of  the  deeds  of  the  law;  and  the  deeds  of \nthe  law  do  not  justify.     If  they  do  not  justify, \n\n\nwhich  Paul \nspeaks. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  401 \n\nthey   prove   their  fulfillers    to    be    ungodly,  and  sect.  x. \nleave  them  so.     But  the  ungodly  are  guilty  per- \nsons,    and    deserving    of   God's    wrath. — -These \nthings  are  so  plain,  that  no  one  can  even  mutter \nought  againt  them.x \n\nBut  it  is  common  to  elude  Paul  here,  and  to  Evasion, \nget  out-fey  saying,  that  by  the  deeds  of  the  law  Gonial \nhe  means  the  ceremonial  ordinances,  which  have  law  of \nbecome  deadly  since  the  death  of  Christ. \n\nI  reply  ;  this  is  that  ignorant  mistake  of  Je- \nrome's, which,  in  spite  of  Augustine's  bold  resist- \nance, hath,  through  God's  departure  and  Satan's \nascendency,  flowed  abroad  into  the  world,  and \ncontinued  to  this  day :  by  which  it  hath  also  been \nbrought  to  pass,  that  Paul  could  not  possibly  be \nunderstood,  and  that  the  knowledge  of  Christ  has \nnecessarily  been  obscured.  Nay,  had  there  been \nno  error  besides  in  the  church,  this  one  was  suf- \nficiently pestilent  and  powerful  to  make  havoc  of \nthe  Gospel ;  by  which,  except  a  special  grace \nhath  interposed,  Jerome  has  earned  hell  rather \nthan  heaven — so  far  am  I  from  venturing  to \ncanonize  him,  or  to  call  him  a  saint.  It  is  not  true \nthen,  that  Paul  speaks  only  of  ceremonial  works  ; \nelse  how  wdll  his  argument  stand,  by  which  he \ncomes  to  the  conclusion,  that  all  are  unrighteous, \n\n\nx  Luther  misapprehends  the  condemnation  here  pronounced \nby  the  Apostle.  It  is  not  that  the  works  of  the  law  are  evil  • \nor  that  the  works  of  men,  so  far  as  they  be  a  fulfilment  of  it, \nare  evil ;  but  that  they  do  not  really  perform  these  works.  If \nthey  really  performed  these  works,  such  testimonies  as  those \nabove  would  not  have  been  borne  against  them.  The  fact  that \nsuch  testimonies  have  been  borne  (which  he  has  shewn  to  be \ndesigned  especially  for  them)  proves  that  they  are  not  keepers \nof  the  law  but  breakers  of  it ;  and  as  breakers,  not  as  keepers, \nare  condemned  by  it. — Luther  is  again  in  error  about  the  word. \n•  flesh  ;'  it  is  not  sinful  affection  here,  any  more  than  in \nthe  former  instances  :  it  is  a  name  for  the  human  species  ; \n\"  no  flesh\"  is  l  no  human  being.'  The  argument  however  is \nnot  shaken.  If  the  deeds  of  the  law  be  never  so  good,  but  man \nand  Freewill  instead  of  attaining  to  them  are  condemned  by \nthem  ;  what  is  man,  and  what  is  Freewill  ? \n\n2  D \n\n\n402  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.   and  have  need  of  grace  ?     A  man  might  say,  I \n\ngrant  we  are  not  justified  by  ceremonial  deeds; \n\nstill  a  man  might  be  justified  by  the  moral \ndeeds  of  the  decalogue.  So  that  you  have  not \nproved  grace  necessary  to  us  by  your  reasoning. \nBesides,  what  would  be  the  use  of  that  grace, \nwhich  has  only  freed  us  from  the  ceremonial  ordi- \nnances ?  Those  are  the  easiest  of  all,  and  may  at \nleast  be  extorted  from  us  by  fear  or  self-love. \n\nAgain,  it  is  a  mistake  to  say  that  the  cere- \nmonial ordinances  have  become  deadly  and  un- \nlawful since  the  death  of  Christ.  Paul  has  never \nsaid  this.  He  says,  that  they  do  not  justify ;  and \nthat  they  do  not  profit  a  man  before  God,  so  as \nto  free  him  from  the  charge  of  ungodliness.  It \nis  perfectly  consistent  with  this,  that  a  man  may \ndo  them,  and  do  nothing  unlawful  in  doing  so. \nJust  as  eating  and  drinking  are  works  which  do \nnot  justify,  and  do  not  commend  us  to  God;  but \na  man  does  not  therefore  commit  an  unlawful  act \nin  eating  and  drinking. \n\nThey  err  also,  inasmuch  as  the  ceremonial \nworks  were  enjoined  and  exacted  by  the  old  law \nequally  with  the  decalogue;  so  that  the  latter \nhad  neither  less  nor  more  authority  than  the \nformer:  and  Paul  speaks  first  to  the  Jews;  as \nhe  says  in  Romans  i.y — Let  no  one  doubt  therefore, \nthat  Ci  by  the  deeds  of  the  law\"  is  meant  c  all \nthe  works  of  the  whole  law:'  for  they  must  not \nbe  even  called  works  of  the  law,  if  the  law  hath \nbeen  abolished,  and  is  deadly :  an  abrogated  law \nis  now  no  longer  a  law,  as  Paul  knew  very  well ; \nand  therefore  he  does  not  speak  of  an  abrogated \n\ny  I  say,  'to  the  Jews  only;*  (see  above,  Sect-  ii.  note  c, \nand  Sect.  vii.  note  P)  though  Luther  will  have  it,  to  both  : \nclearly,  however,  both  had  it  not  in  the  same  form;  and  the  Jew \nhad  the  ceremonial,  which  the  Gentile  confessedly  had  not. \nIt  was  necessary  to  Luther's  argument  therefore,  that  he  should \nmark  the  distinction. — He  goes  on,  (  Nor  had  this  been  abro- \ngated.' \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  403 \n\nlaw,  when  he  makes  mention  of  the  deeds  of  the  sect.  x. \n\nlaw,   but   of  a  law  which  is  still  in  force,   and \n\nregnant.     Else,  how  easy  would  it  have  been  for \n\nhim  to  say,   '  The  law  itself  is  now  abrogated!\" \n\nwhich  would  have  been  plain  and  clear. — But  let \n\nus  adduce  Paul  himself,  his  own  best  interpreter, \n\nwho  says  in  Galatians  iii.  \"  As  many  as  are  of \n\nthe  works  of  the  law  are  under  the  curse :  for  it \n\nis  written,  Cursed  is  every  one  who  shall  not  have \n\ncontinued  in  all  things  which  are  written  in  the \n\nbook  of  the  law,  to  do  them.\"     You  observe  that \n\nPaul  here,  where  he  is  pleading  just  the  same  cause \n\nas  to  the  Romans,  and  in  the  same  words,  speaks \n\nof  all  the  laws  which  are  written  in  the  book  of  the \n\nlaw,  as  often  as  he  mentions  the  works  of  the  law. \n\nWhat  is  still  more  wonderful,  he  absolutely \ncites  Moses  when  pronouncing  a  curse  upon  those \nwho  continue  ?iot  in  the  law,  whereas  he  himself \npronounces  those  cursed  who  are  of  the  deeds  of \nthe  law,  adducing  an  opposite  passage  to  confirm \nhis  opposing  sentiment;  inasmuch  as  the  former \n(Moses)  is  negative,  the  latter  (Paul)  is  affirma- \ntive.— But  he  does  so,  because  the  matter  stands \nthus  before  God  :  those  who  are  most  zealous  of \nthe  deeds  of  the  law  do  least  of  all  fulfil  the \nlaw  ;  for  that  they  lack  the  Spirit,  who  is  the  ful- \nfiller  of  the  law  :  which  they  may  attempt,  it  is \ntrue,  to  fulfil  through  their  own  powers,  but  can \neffect  nothing.  Thus  each  saying  is  true  :  accord- \ning to  Moses  they  be  accursed  who  do  not  con- \ntinue ;  according  to  Paul  they  be  accursed  who \nare  of  the  deeds  of  the  law :  for  each  of  these \nwriters  requires  the  Spirit  in  his  performer. \nWithout  this  Spirit,  the  deeds  of  the  law,  how \nmuch  soever  be  done,  do  not  justify,  as  Paul \nsays  :  and  for  the  same  reason,  they  do  not  con- \ntinue in  all  the  things  which  are  written,  as  Moses \nsays.* \n\nz  The  cavil  is,  Paul  speaks  of  ceremonial  works  exclusively  ; \nLuther's  answer  is,   1.  Paul's  argument  would  be  defective. \n\n2  d  2 \n\n\n404  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npartv.       In  fine,  Paul  abundantly  confirms  what  I  am \n\nhere  advancing,  by  his  own  division  of  persons. \n\nSECT.  XL  °       J                                                     r \n\n2.  Grace  would  be  a  mere  trifle.     3.  These  works  have  not \n\nPaul's  become  deathly.     4.  They  were  a  part  of  the  law  requirements \n\nmeaning  as  much  as  the  decalogue,  and  have  never  been  abrogated. \n\nls>  '  w°1-ks  5#  When  treating  the  same  subject  in  Galatians  iii.   he  ex- \n\no  t  le  law,  press]y  says,  '  All  things  which  are  written  in  the  book  of  the \n\ndone  in  f       ,  J       r    '                      ° \n\nthe  flesh,      law^'  ,     ,  , \n\ncondemn.'  ^ne  true  anc*  snort  answer  to  this  cavil  is,  the  whole  law \nceremonial  and  moral  is  one  institution,  and  Paul  makes  no \nexceptions  or  distinctions.  Luther  goes  wide,  and  says  many \nexceptionable  things.  What  he  says  about  f  not  abrogated,' \nis  ambiguous,  inconclusive,  and  unnecessary.  Does  he  mean  that \nthe  law  in  both  its  parts  is  still  standing,  just  as  it  was  ?  Was \nit  the  Apostle's  place  here  to  say  '  not  abrogated,'  if  he  con- \nsidered it  so  ?  as  he  does  explicitly  in  Romans  vi.  vii.  2  Cor.  iii. \nEphes.  ii.  Colos.  ii.  Galat.  iv.  1  Tim.  i.  Is  it  true,  that  what \nhas  been  the  law  shall  not  be  spoken  of  under  the  name  of  the \nlaw,  except  it  be  still  in  force  and  reigning  ?  Did  the  Jews,  to \nwhom  I  say  only,  he  says  firstly  (see  last  note),  this  argument \nis  addressed,  require  any  assertion  of  its  authority  ? — What  he \nsays  to  reconcile  the  apparent  discrepancy  between  Paul  and \nMoses,  which  forms  the  basis  of  his  interpretation  and  position \nhere,  he  says  under  a  misapprehension  of  both  Paul's  and \nMoses's  meaning,  and  says  unwisely  and  untruly.  (Compare \nDeut  xxvii.  1 — 26,  with  Galat.  iii.  10.)  Paul  has  it  not  for  his \nobject  to  condemn  as  many  as  are  doers  of  the  law,  but  \"  as  many \nas  are  of  the  works  of  the  law;\"  that  is,  ' all  those  who  are \nlooking  for  justification,  in  whole  or  in  part,  from  their  obedi- \nence to  the  law.'  What  inconsistency  is  there  between  this \ninterdict  of  Paul's,  and  Moses's  curse,  denounced  upon  every \none  that  continueth  not  in  all  things,  &c.  ? — Paul  neither  takes \naway  this  curse,  nor  condemns  the  fulfiller  :  he  condemns  the \nattempt  to  fulfil,  not  because  it  succeeds,  but  because  it  fails, \nand  must  ever  fail. — '  They  both  require  the  Spirit  in  their \nperformer :  Moses's  cursed  continues  not,  because  he  has \nnot  the  Spirit ;  Paul's  cursed  is  not  justified,  because  he  does \nthe  works  without  the  Spirit.'  Now  there  is  no  consideration \nabout  either  -power  or  motive,  in  either.  Moses  in  effect  says, \n*  fulfil  j'  without  inquiring  or  teaching  how:  and  Paul  says, \n'  aiming  to  be  justified  by  the  law  curses,  because  man  cannot \nfulfil  it,  and  there  is  a  curse  upon  him  who  doth  not.'  But \nso  far  is  the  Spirit  from  being  the  law  fulfiller  (legis  consum- \nmator),  as  Luther  entitles  him;  that  he  who  hath  the  Spirit, \nafter  justification,  does  not  \"  continue  in  all  things,\"  and  would \nbe  condemned  still,  if  that  were  required  of  him  ;  nor  is  it  in \nany  wise  his  aim  to  do  so.  His  aim  is  to  do  the  whole  will  of \nGod,  in  that  relation  into  which  he  has  now  manifestly  and  con- \nsciously been  brought  by  Him  in  Christ,  as  God  shall  be  pleased \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  405 \n\nHe  divides  men  who  are  the  doers  of  the  law  into  SECT.xr. \ntwro  parties :  the  one  he  makes  spiritual  doers, \nthe  other  carnal  doers  ;  leaving  none  between  the \ntwo.  For  thus  he  speaks,  \"  By  the  deeds  of \nthe  law  shall  no  flesh  be  justified.\"  What \ndoes  this  mean,  but  that  they  work  at  the  law \nwithout  the  Spirit,  seeing  they  are  flesh;  that  is, \nungodly  and  ignorant  of  God  :  whom  those  works \nprofit  nothing?  Thus,  in  Gal.  iii.  using  the  same \ndivision,  he  says,  u  Received  ye  the  Spirit  from \nthe  deeds  of  the  law,  or  from  the  hearing  of  faith  ?\" \nAnd  again,  Rom.  iii.  u  Now  the  righteousness  of \nGod  without  the  law  is  manifested.\"  And  again, \n\"  We  judge  that  a  man  is  justified  by  faith  with- \nout the  deeds  of  the  law.\"  From  all  which,  as  put \ntogether,  it  becomes  plain  and  clear,  that  the \nSpirit  is  opposed  by  Paul  to  the  works  of  the \nlaw — just  as  it  is  to  all  other  things  which  are  not \nspiritual,  and  to  all  the  powers  and  pretences  of \nthe  flesh — so  as  to  make  it  certain,  that  this  is \nthe  sentiment  of  Paul,  agreeing  with  Christ  in \nJohn  iii.  that  all  which  is  not  of  the  Spirit  (be  it \nnever  so  specious,  so  holy  and  so  excellent)  is \nflesh  ;  and  therefore,  that  even  the  most  beautiful \n\nto  make  known  that  will  to  him,  and  to  enable  him,  by  his \nSpirit  which  dwelleth  and  walketh  in  him  :  a  rule,  if  rule  it \ncan  be  called,  far  more  extensive  and  copious  than  the  law,  and \nof  a  totally  different  character  ;  the  law  of  an  eternally  saved \nand  glorified  sinner,  walking  in  Christ  with  God — his  Father, \nhis  Friend,  his  Portion,  his  exceeding  Joy. — What  he  says \nhere,  and  in  other  places,  about  the  justification  of  the  Spirit,  is \nfallacious.  His  language  implies  that,  if  the  obedience  of  those \nwho  are  \"  of  the  works  of  the  law  \"  were  yielded  in  the  Spirit, \nit  would  justify ;  and  that  it  was  for  lack  of  this  gift,  that \nMoses's  worshippers  did  not  escape  their  curse,  by  \"continuing \nin  all  things.\"  Now,  though  it  be  true  that  the  Spirit  justifies \nthe  Lord's  called  people  (1  Cor.  vi.  11.),  as  it  did  \"  God  mani- \nfest in  the  flesh\"  (1  Tim.  iii.  16.),  by  proving  whose,  and  who, \nand  what  they  are  ;  this  is  perfectly  distinct  from  any  act  of \nobedience  which  removes  curse,  or  earns  acceptance. — All \nhe  wants  from  ;  Galatians,  however,  he  has  :  f  Paul,  treating \nthe  same  subject  there,  expressly  comprehends  the  whole \nlaw.' \n\n\n406  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.    works  of  the  divine  law  are  of  this  character,  by \n\nwhatsoever  powers  they  may  happen  to  have  been \n\nwrung  out.  For  the  Spirit  of  Christ  is  necessary  ; \nwithout  which  they  are  all  deserving  only  of \ndamnation.  Let  it  be  a  settled  point  then,  that \nPaul  means  by  the  deeds  of  the  law  not  those \nwhich  are  ceremonial  only,  but  all  the  works  of \nthe  whole  law.  It  will  at  the  same  time  be  settled, \nthat  whatsoever  be  done  without  the  Spirit,  in \ndoing  the  deeds  of  the  law,  is  condemned.  But \nthis  power  of  Freewill — the  most  excellent  thing \nforsooth  in  man — seeing  it  is  of  Freewill  properly \nso  called  that  we  are  now  treating,  is  without  the \nSpirit.  Whereas,  to  be  of  the  works  of  the  law \nis  such  a  thing,  that  nothing  better  can  be  said  of \na  man.  He  does  not  say,  you  observe,  'as  many \nas  are  of  sins  and  of  transgression  against  the \nlaw;'  but  \"  as  many  as  are  of  the  deeds  of  the  law;\" \nthat  is,  the  best  of  men — men  zealous  for  the  law — \nwho,  besides  the  power  of  Freewill,  have  even \nbeen  assisted  by  the  law ;  that  is,  instructed  and \nexercised  therein.* \n\na  I  object  to  Luther's  interpretations  and  conclusions  in  this \nsection.  He  infers  a  division  of  law  workers  from  the  words  no \njlesh;  by  which  Paul  expresses  not  division,  but  universality.  No \nflesh  (see  above,  Part  iv.  Sect,  xxxvii.  note  k)  is  no  human  being. \nThe  argument  drawn  from  this  supposed  division  therefore — \nthat  it  is  the  deeds  of  the  law  done  without  the  Spirit,  which \nfail  to  justify,  and  do  absolutely  condemn — falls  to  the  ground. \nIn  the  several  passages  which  he  quotes,  the  opposition  is \nnot  between  the  Spirit  and  the  deeds  of  the  law,  but  between \nthe  Law  and  the  Gospel.  (Gal.  iii.  Rom.  iii.)  Nor  do  I  allow \nthe  parallel  between  this  text  and  John  iii.  6.  any  further  than \nthat  the  word  '  flesh  '  is  used  in  the  same  sense  in  both  ;  but \nthat,  not  Luther's  sense.  I  must  object  to  the  assertion,  that \nit  is  the  absence  of  the  Spirit  which  makes  the  deeds  of  the \nlaw  damnable  ;  which  would  not  be  damnable,  if  He  were  pre- \nsent in  them  :  as  if  any  works  of  man  in  the  flesh,  performed \nwith  or  without  the  Spirit,  '  could  endure  the  severity  of  God's \njudgment !' — All  I  can  allow  to  Luther,  therefore,  in  this  sec- \ntion is,  c  By  the  deeds  of  the  law  shall  no  flesh  be  justified \nin  his  sight;'  therefore  Freewill,  even  with  the  help  of \nthe  law,  is  still  condemned ;  for  with  that  help  she  cannot \njustify.     Then  what  is  she  without  it  ? — And  is  not  this  enough  ? \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  407 \n\nIf  then  Freewill  assisted  by  the  law,  and  occu-     sect. \npied  in  the  law  with  all  its  might,  profits  nothing,      XIL \nand  does  not  justify,  bat  is  left  in  ungodliness  and \nflesh;   what  are  we  to  think  that  it  can  do  alone,  does  is  to \nand  without  the  law?  shew  sin. \n\n\"  By  the  law,  says  he,  is  the  knowledge  of \nsin/'  He  shews  here,  how  much,  and  how  far,  the \nlaw  profits  a  man ;  in  other  words,  that  Freewill \nis  so  blind,  when  left  to  herself,  as  not  even  to \nknow  sin,  but  to  stand  in  need  of  the  law  for  a \nteacher.  Now  what  can  he  endeavour  towards \nthe  taking  away  of  sin,  who  does  not  know  what \nsin  is  ?  This  is  what  he  can  do  ;  he  can  take  sin \nfor  no  sin,  and  what  is  not  sin  for  sin ;  as  expe- \nrience abundantly  shews.  How  does  the  world \npersecute  the  righteousness  of  God  which  is \npreached  in  the  Gospel,  vilifying  it  as  heresy, \nerror,  and  all  other  the  worst  possible  names,  by \nthe  instrumentality  of  those  very  persons,  whom \nshe  accounts  the  best  of  men,  and  the  most  zealous \nfor  righteousness  and  godliness.  Meanwhile, \nshe  makes  a  boast  and  brag  of  her  own  works  and \nactions,  which  are  in  reality  sin  and  error,  as \nthough  they  were  righteousness  and  wisdom. \nPaul  cloth  therefore  stop  the  mouth  of  Freewill \nwith  this  word  of  his,  by  teaching  that  sin  is \nshewn  her  by  the  law;  she  being  herself  one  who \ndoes  not  know  what  is    sin :  so  far  is  he  from \n\nLuther  misapprehends  the  scope  of  the  Apostle's  argument. \nHe  is  not  reasoning  and  declaring  about  man  as  with,,  and  as \nwithout,  the  Spirit  :  but  having  shewn  what  man  is,  both  Jew \nand  Gentile,  from  Scripture  ;  he  is  arguing,  how  impossible \nit  is  that  he  should  be  justified  by  the  law.  The  argument  is \nagainst  justification  by  the  law,  as  preparatory  to  his  opening  of \njustification  by  the  Gospel ;  not  against  man's  natural  impo- \ntency  and  imbecility,  whilst  without  the  Spirit. — Luther  makes \n'  not  justified'  to  mean  the  same  as  '  damned.'  It  implies  damn- \nation, certainly-  but  Luther's  expressions  and  argument  inti- \nmate, that  damnation  is  brought  and  incurred  by  doing  these \ndeeds  without  the  Spirit ;  whereas,  in  fact,  that  damnation  had \nalready  been  incurred,  before  the  law  came  ;  and  was  only  con- \ntinued and  manifested  thereby,  instead  of  being  removed. \n\n\n408  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.    granting   to   her    any    power   of  striving    after \ngood. \n\nAnd  here  that  question  of  Diatribe's,  so  often \nrepeated  throughout  her  whole  treatise,  '  Tf  we \ncan  do  nothing,  what  is  the  use  of  so  many  laws, \nso  many  precepts,  so  many  threatenings,  so  many \npromises/  is  answered.  Paul  here  replies,  \"  By \nthe  law  is  the  knowledge  of  sin.\"  He  gives  a  far \ndifferent  answer  to  this  question,  from  what  man, \nor  Freewill,  thinks  for.  Freewill  is  not  proved, \nsays  he,  by  the  law;  she  does  not  work  together \nwith  it  unto  righteousness:  for  righteousness  is \nnot  by  the  law,  but  the  knowlege  of  sin.  This  is \nthe  benefit,  this  the  effect,  this  the  office  of  the \nlaw,  to  be  a  light  to  the  ignorant  and  blind  :  and \nsuch  a  light,  as  shews  disease,  sin,  wickedness, \ndeath,  hell,  the  wrath  of  God,  to  be  ours;  but \ndoes  not  help,  or  release  us  from  them.  She  is \ncontented  with  having  shewn  us  what  our  state  is. \nUpon  this,  the  man  knowing  his  disease  of  sin,  is \nsad,  is  afflicted,  yea  despairs.  The  law  does  not \nhelp  him  )  much  less  can  he  help  himself.  Another \nlight  is  necessary  to  shew  him  his  remedy.  This \nis  the  word  of  the  Gospel,  displaying  Christ  as  the \ndeliverer  from  all  these.  It  is  not  Reason  or  Free- \nwill which  makes  Him  known:  nay,  how  should \nshe  make  him  known,  when  she  herself  is  very \ndarkness,  needing  the  light  of  the  law  to  shew  her \nthat  self-disease,  which  she  sees  not  by  her  own \nlight,  but  imagines  to  be  soundness.15 \n\nb  How  clearly  do  these  latter  words  of  Paul  confirm  the  view \ngiven  in  the  former  note  as  to  his  meaning  and  design  !  '  The \nlaw  cannot  justify,  for  it  exposes  this  state  of  man  which  I  have \nbeen  charging  upon  him  ;  it  just  manifests  what  he  is.'  He \ndoes  not  say  makes  sin,  or  makes  him  a  sinner;  but  is,  or  leads \nto,  knowledge  and  acknowledgment  of  sin.  What  connection \nWould  this  clause  have  with  the  preceding  sentence,  if  the \no'biect  were  to  shew,  that  man's  law  deeds  done  without  the \nSpirit  do  not  justify,  implying  that  with  the  Spirit  they  do  ? — \nBut  how  strong  is  the  argument,  when  correctly  opened, \nagainst  Freewill  !  She  does  not  even  know,  what  is  sinful  and \nwhat  is  not j  nor  how  vile  she  is,  through  her  propensity  to  it. — \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  409 \n\nIn  Galatians  too,  he  treats  the  same  question     sect. \nin  just  the  same  way,  when  he  says,  what  then  is \n\n\nthe  law  ?  and  answers  this  question,  not  as  Dia-  Confirme(i \ntribe  would,  by  saying  that  it  proves  there  is  such  by  Gal.  m. \na  thing  as  Freewill,  but  by  saying,  \"  It  was  *9,  ando0 \nordained  for  the  sake  of  transgressions,  until  the \nseed  should  come,  to  which  he  had  made  the  pro- \nmise.\" For  the  sake  of  transgressions,  he  says : \nnot  to  restrain  them,  as  Jerome  dreams  (since \nPaul  maintains,  that  it  was  promised  to  the  Seed \nwhich  should  come,  that  He  should  take  away  and \nshould  restrain  sin,  by  the  free  gift  of  righteous- \nness) ;  but  to  increase  transgressions,  as  he  writes \nin  Rom.  v.  \"  The  law  stole  in,  that  sin  might \nabound.\"0     Not  that  there  were  no  sins,  or  that \n\nLuther  reads  the  word  \"  justified\"  in  the  present  tense,  for  which \nI  do  not  find  any  authority  :  the  future  defines  the  sense  both  of \nSion  and  of  €7ri^vivais  ;  that  it  is  therefore,  not  because,  and \n* increased  or  perfected  knowledge,'  not  e  acknowledgment.' \nThe  law  not  only  shews  what  is  sin  to  a  greater  extent,  but \nalso  its  power  over  us,  and  its  malignity,  or  \"  exceeding  sinful- \nness :\"  it  exacerbates  and  excites  by  forbidding  and  requiring \n(see  Rom.  vii.  7 — 12.)  ;  and  what  must  that  soul,  or  Freewill \nbe,  which  is  provoked  to  evil  by  such  a  cause  ? \n\nc  Luther  does  not  see  quite  the  whole  of  this  great  text, \nthough  he  sees  much  of  it.  To  understand  it,  we  must  connect \nwhat  has  gone  before  with  it ;  beginning  with  verse  12. \n\"  Wherefore,  as  by  one  man  sin  entered  into  the  world,  and \ndeath  by  sin  :  even  so  death  passed  upon  all  men  through  him \nin  whom  all  sinned.  For  until  the  law  sin  was  in  the  world  ; \nbut  sin  is  not  imputed  when  there  is  no-  law.\" — Man — the \nwhole  race — sinned  in  and  with  the  first  man  ;  each  indivi- \ndual, distinctly  and  personally,  having  been  created  with, \nand  being  inseparable  from  him,  when  he  personally  com- \nmitted the  one  transgression. — Though  sins  were  committed \nafterwards  by  the  several  individuals  of  the  race,  as  brought \nout,  one  after  another,  into  manifest  existence ;  these  were \nnot  imputed,  but  they  were  dealt  with  on  the  ground  of  the \nfirst  transgression,  in  which  they  were  distinctly,  individually \nand  personally,  parties  3  by  means  of  their  union  and  unity \nwith  Adam. — The  law  afterwards  '«'  stole  in,\"  that  the  offence \nmight  be  multiplied;  or,  as  in  Galatians,  because  of  offences  ;*  that \n\n*Witli  whatever  little  variety  this  test  maybe  read  and  understood — whe- \nther added  because  of,  or  put  into  the  hand  of  a  Mediator  because  of — it  must \nimply,  if  it  do  not  express,  the  same  broad  truth,  that  the  law  had  no  other \neffect  and  design  than  to  multiply  transgressions. — Again,  the  application  of \n\n\n410  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\nPART  V.    sins  did  not  abound,  without  the  law,  but  inas- \n\nmuch   as  transgressions  were   not  known  to  be \n\ntransgressions,  or  such  great  offences,  but  the \ngreater  part,  and  the  greatest  of  them,  were \naccounted  righteousnesses.  Now  if  sin  be  not \nknown,  there  is  no  room  for  remedy,  and  no  hope, \nbecause  they  would  not  bear  the  hand  of  the \nphysician;  as  being  whole  in  their  own  eyes,  and \nhaving  no  need  of  a  physician.  The  law  there- \nfore is  necessary  in  order  to  make  sin  known  ; \nthat,  by  knowing  the  baseness  and  vastness  of  his \nsin,  the  proud  man,  who  seemeth  whole  in  his  own \neyes,  may  be  humbled,  and  may  sigh  and  pant \nafter  the  grace  which  is  set  before  him  in  Christ. \nSee  what  a  simple  sentence  is  here !  \"  By  the \nlaw  is  the  knowledge  of  sin/'  Yet  this  sentence \nof  itself  is  quite  powerful  enough  to  confound  and \noverturn  Freewill.  For  if  it  be  true,  that  she \nknows  not  of  herself  what  sin  and  wickedness  is, \nas  Paul  says  both  here,  and  in  Rom.  vii.  (\"I  had \nnot  known  lust  to  be  sin,  except  the  law  had  said, \nThou  shalt  not  covet\")  how  shall  she  ever  know \n\nis,  that  there  might  be  more  than  one  offence ;  that  many  offences \nmight  be  added  to  the  first.  It  is  not,  therefore,  merely  the \ncommunication  of  the  knowledge  of  sin,  that  was  sought  and \nconveyed  by  that  institution,  but  multiplication  of  transgres- \nsion ;  that,  with  regard  to  the  Lord's  people,  who  are  the \ndisplayers  of  God,  specially  as  that  God  which  is  love — love  to \nthe  uttermost — love  in  the  way  of  grace  and  mercy — the  God \nof  all  grace  might  be  shewn  as  what  He  is,  in  the  much  more \nabounding  of  grace,  where  sin  hath  abounded. — Sin  has  never \nbeen  imputed  by  God  to  man,  any  more  than  by  man  to  himself, \nwithout  express  and  absolute  enactment.  The  command,  or \nprohibition,  in  the  garden  was  of  this  sort  ;  and  there  hath  been \nnone  given  since,  save  the  law — which  was  confined  to  one \nfamily,  the  seed  of  Abraham,  for  a  while  the  visible  church — \nand  a  second,  declaredly  an  universal  one,  \"  Repent  ye  and \nbelieve  the  Gospel.\"  On  the  former  of  these  universal  com- \nmands 1  death  was  suspended ;  on  the  latter,  life.  He  that \nbelieveth — which  implies  repentance — shall  be  saved  ;  he  that \nbelieveth  not — which  implies  impenitence — shall  perish. \n\nRom.  vii.  7.  is  equally  just  when  that  text  is  understood  in  its  fulness — the \nprovocation  which  the  law  gives  to  sin— as  in  its  inferior  and  more  common \ninterpretation,  of  mere  teaching. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  411 \n\nwhat  is  righteousness  and  goodness  ?  If  she  does  sect. \nnot  know  what  righteouness  is,  how  shall  she  ever \nstrive  after  it  ?  We  know  not  sin — in  which  we \nhave  been  born,  in  which  we  live  and  move  and \nhave  our  being  ;  say  rather,  which  lives  and \nmoves  and  reigns  in  us — how  then  should  we \nknow  righteousness  which  reigns  without  us,  in \nthe  heavens  !  What  a  mere  nothing,  and  less  than \nnothing,  do  these  words  make  of  that  wretched \nthing  called  Freewill  !d \n\nThese  things  being  so,  Paul  makes  proclama-  Rom.  Hi. \ntion  with  full  confidence  and  authority,   saying,  2,~~ ?5- \n\"  But  now  the  righteousness  of  God  without  the  manythun- \nlaw  is  manifested,  being  witnessed  by  the  law  and  derboits \nthe  Prophets ;   the  righteousness  of  God,  I  say,  Freewill, \nby  faith  in  Jesus  Christ,   unto  all   and  upon  all \nthem  that  believe  in  him.     For  there  is  no  dis- \ntinction :  for  all  have  sinned  and  come  short  of \nthe   glory  of  God;  being  justified  freely  by  his \ngrace,  through  the  redemption  which  is  in  Christ \nJesus;  whom  God  hath  set  forth  as  a  propitiation \nby  faith  in  his  blood,  &c.\" \n\nHere  Paul  utters  nothing  but  thunderbolts  First  ihun- \nagainst  Freewill.  First,  the  righteousness  of  God  derbolt- \nwithout  the  law,  says  he,  is  manifested :  he  sepa- \nrates the  righteousness  of  God  from  the  righteous- \nness of  the  law;  because  the  righteousness  of  faith \ncomes  by  grace,  without  the  law.  What  he  says, \n\"  without  the  law,\"  can  mean  nothing  else,  than \nthat  Christian  righteousness  is  perfectly  inde- \npendent of  the  works  of  the  law ;  so  as  that  the \n\nd  The  wliole  force  of  the  argument  from  this  clause,  ff  By  the \nlaw,  &c.\"  is,  '  if  the  law,  which  does  so  little,  be  necessary, \nwhat  is  Freewill  by  itself?'  Luther,  however,  did  not  thoroughly \napprehend  the  nature  and  design  of  that  interposed  covenant \nand  dispensation  ;  its  twofold  relation  to  Israel,  as  the  elect \nnation,  and  as  the  visible  church — its  universal  typicality — its \nstrict  temporariness — and  its  precise  adaptedness  to  teach  sin  ; \nthat  is,  to  teach  those  who  have  made  themselves  sinners \nbefore  they  are  born  into  the  world,  and  as  such  are  under \nthe  wrath  of  God,  how  just  that  wrath  is. \n\n\n412  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  works  of  the  law  are  of  no  worth  or  power  for  the \nobtaining  of  it.  As  he  says  soon  after,  \"  We \ndetermine  that  a  man  is  justified  by  faith  without \nthe  works  of  the  law:\"  and  as  he  has  said  already, \n\"  By  the  deeds  of  the  law  no  flesh  is  justified \nbefore  him.\"  From  all  which  it  is  most  plain, \nthat  the  endeavour  or  desire  of  Freewill  is  abso- \nlutely nothing:  for,  if  the  righteousness  of  God \nconsists  without  the  law  and  without  the  works  of \nthe  law,  how  shall  it  not  much  more  consist  with- \nout Freewill  ?  Since  it  is  the  highest  endeavour \nof  Freewill  to  be  exercised  about  amoral  righteous- \nness, or  the  works  of  the  law  ;  by  which  its  blind- \nness and  impotency  is  aided.  This  word  'without' \nclears  away  works  morally  good,  clears  away \nmoral  righteousness,  clears  away  preparations  for \ngrace  :  in  short,  invent  what  you  may  as  a  perform- \nance which  Freewill  is  equal  to,  Paul  will  persist \nin  saying,  '  the  righteousness  of  God  has  nothing \nto  do  with  this/ \n\nNow,  although  I  should  grant  that  Freewill \nmight  by  its  own  endeavour  make  advances  some \nwhither ;  that  is,  to  good  works,  or  the  righteous- \nness of  the  civil  law  or  the  moral  law ;  still  it \nadvances  no  way  at  all  towards  the  righteousness \nof  God,  nor  does  God  account  its  endeavours \nworthy  of  any  regard  towards  obtaining  his  righte- \nousness, when  he  says  that  his  righteousness \navaileth  without  the  law.  If  then  Freewill  maketh \nno  advances  towards  the  righteousness  of  God, \nwhat  would  it  be  profited  by  advancing  through  its \nown  performances  and  endeavours  (were  this  pos- \nsible) even  to  the  holiness  of  angels? — These \nsurely  are  no  obscure  or  ambiguous  words ;  here \nis  no  place  left  for  any  tropes.  Paul  manifestly \ndistinguishes  two  sorts  of  righteousness;  ascrib- \ning the  one  to  the  law,  the  other  to  grace:  affirm- \ning, that  the  latter  is  freely  given  without  the \nformer  and  its  works;  but  that  the  former  does \nnot  justify  or  avail  any  thing,  without  the  latter. — \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  413 \n\nLet  me  be  made  to  see  then,  how  Freewill  can     sect. \nsubsist  and  be  defended  amidst  these  objections. \n\n\nThe  second  thunderbolt   is,   that  he  says  the  second \nrighteousness   of  God  is   manifested,  and   is   in  thunder- \nforce,  unto  all  and  upon  all  who  believe  in  Christ;  bolt' \nand  that  there  is  no  difference. \n\nAgain  he  in  the  clearest  terms  divides  the  whole \nhuman  race  into  two  parts,  and  gives  the  righte- \nousness of  God  to  believers,  whilst  he  takes  it \naway  from  unbelievers.  Is  any  one  so  mad  then, \nas  to  doubt  that  the  power  or  endeavour  of  Free- \nwill is  something  different  from  faith  in  Christ  ? \nNow  Paul  denies  that  any  thing,  which  subsists \nwithout  the  limits  of  this  faith,  is  righteous  before \nGod;  and,  if  not  righteous  before  God,  it  must  be \nsin.  For  with  God  there  is  nothing  left  in  the \nmidway  between  righteousness  and  sin,  as  a \nsort  of  neutral  substance,  which  is  neither  righte- \nousness, nor  sin.  Else,  Paul's  whole  argument \nwould  fail,  which  proceeds  upon  this  division  of \nthings;  namely,  that  whatsoever  is  done  and  carried \non  amongst  men,  is  either  righteousness  or  sin  : \nrighteousness,  if  it  be  done  in  faith ;  sin,  if  done \nwithout  it.  With  men  indeed  there  are  actions, \nit  is  true,  of  a  middle  and  neutral  character,  in \nwhich  they  neither  owe  nor  yield  any  thing  to  each \nother  mutually ;  bat  the  ungodly  man  sins  against \nGod,  whether  he  eat  or  drink,  or  whatsoever \nhe  do,  because  he  is  perpetually  using  God's \ncreatures  wickedly  and  ungratefully,  without \ngiving  glory  to  God  from  his  heart  at  any \nmoment.6 \n\ne  The  believer  alone  is  righteous  before  God.  It  is  not  pre- \ntended by  those,  with  whom  Luther  reasons,,  that  Freewill  makes \nany  man  a  believer  :  it  is  a  power  and  exercise  distinct  from, \nand  prior  to  faith.  If  the  faithful  man,  then,  alone  is  just,  what \nis  the  Freewill  man — and  of  what  character  is  his  act  r — It  is \nscarcely  necessary  to  notice  here,  that  Luther  speaks  of  God's \nmanifested  righteous  ones.  Those  who  have  been  justified  from \neverlasting,  in  the  covenant  transactions  between  the  divine \npersons,  referred  to  the  Father  and  to  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ \n\n\n414 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

If \nhe  does  not  sin,  why  does  Paul  not  except,  but \ninvolve  him  amongst  the  rest,  without  any  dis- \ntinction ?  Assuredly,  he  who  says  all  have  sinned \nexcepts  none  in  any  place,  at  any  time,  for  any \nperformance,  for  any  endeavour.  If  you  except  a \nman  for  any  endeavour  or  work,  you  make  Paul  a \nliar;  because  this  Freewill  worker,  or  endeavourc-r, \nis  also  numbered  amongst  the  all,  and  in  the  all,  and \nPaul  ought  to  have  given  him  reverence,  and  not \nto  have  numbered  him  so  freely,  and  so  generally, \namongst  the  sinners. \n\nSo  again,  it  is  no  light  thunderbolt,  his  saying \nthat  they  are  devoid  of  the  glory  of  God.- — The \nglory  of  God  may  be  understood  with  a  difference \nhere,  actively  and  passively.  Paul  contrives  this \nby  his  use  of  the  Hebrew  idioms,  in  which  he  is \nfrequent.  Actively,  the  glory  of  God  is  that  with \nwhich  God  glories  in  us ;  passively,  that  with \nwhich  we  glory  in  him.  I  think  it  should  be \nunderstood  passively  here:  just  as  the  faith  of \nChrist,  in  Latin,  expresses  the  faith  which  Christ \nhas ;  but  by  the  Hebrews  the  faith  of  Christ  is \nunderstood  to  mean  the  faith  which  we  have \ntowards  Christ.     So  the  righteousness  of  God,  in \n\n(theFather's  will  appointing  to  receive  them  as  just,  through  the \nmerits  of  the  most  precious  death  and  passion  of  his  dear  Son) \nare  manifested  to  be  such,  by  the  blessed  Spirit's  acting  upon \nand  within  them  in  due  season,  and  thereby  enabling,  yea  con- \nstraining them  to  believe.  Now  therefore  they  have  conformed \nwith  that  edict  of  God,  described  above  (Sect.  xiii.  note  c), \nwrhich  says,  \"  Repent  ye  and  believe  the  Gospel  :\"  nor  is  it \nuntil  this  manifestation  has  thus  been  made,  that  any  of  their \npersonal  actings  become  the  acts  of  the  righteous  ;  or  can  in \nin  any  sort,  consequently,  be  accounted  as  righteous  acts.  The \nacts  of  Freewill  therefore,  being  performed  before  the  man  has \nentered  into  this  state,  are  acts  of  sin. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  415 \n\nLatin,  means  the  righteousness  which  God  pos-  sect. \nsesses :  but  by  the  Hebrews  is  understood  to \nmean  the  righteousness  which  we  have  from  God, \nand  before  God.  Thus  I  understand  the  glory  of \nGod,  not  Latin-wise  but  Hebrew-wise,  as  denoting \nthe  glory  which  we  have  iu  God,  and  before  God, \nand  which  may  be  called  glory  in  God.  He,  then, \nglories  in  God,  who  knows  of  a  surety,  that  God \nhas  a  favour  towards  him,  and  counts  him  worthy \nof  a  kind  regard,  so  that  what  he  does  is  pleasing \nin  his  sight,  or  what  displeases  is  freely  forgiven \nand  borne  with. \n\nIf  then  the  endeavours  of  Freewill  be  not  sin, \nbut  goodness,  in  the  sight  of  God,  assuredly  she \nmay  boast,  and  with  confidence  in  that  glory  may \nsay,  c  this  pleases  God/  i  God  looks  with  an  eye \nof  favour  upon  this/  '  God  ascribes  a  worthiness \nto  this  and  accepts  it,  or  at  least  bears  with  and \nforgives  it/  For  this  is  the  sort  of  glory  which \nthe  faithful  have  in  God ;  which  they  who  have \nnot,  are  rather  confounded  before  him.  But  Paul \ndenies  this  to  all  men  here,  affirming  that  they  are \nabsolutely  devoid  of  this  glory  :  which  experience \nalso  proves.  Ask  all  the  party  of  Freewill  endea- \nvourers  without  exception,  and,  if  you  can  shew  me \none,  who  seriously  from  his  heart  can  say  of  any \none  desire  and  endeavour  of  his,  'I  know  this  is \nwell  pleasing  to  God/  I  will  acknowledge  myself \nconquered,  and  will  yield  the  palm  to  you.  But  I \nknow  that  no  such  man  will  be  found.  Now,  if \nthis  glory  be  wanting,  so  that  conscience  dares  not \ncertainly  to  know  or  to  be  confident,  that  this  parti- \ncular act  is  pleasing  to  God,  we  may  be  sure  that  it \ndoes  not  please  God.  Because,  as  the  man  believes, \nso  it  is  with  him :  for  he  does  not  believe  that  he \ncertainly  pleases  God — which,  however,  is  neces- \nsary; since  this  is  the  very  crime  of  unbelief!,  to \ndoubt  of  the  favour  of  God  :  who  would  have  us \nbelieve  with  the  most  assured  faith,  that  he  favour- \neth  us.  Thus  we  prove  by  the  very  testimony  of \ntheir  own  conscience,  that,  since  Freewill  is  desti- \n\n\n416  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  tute  of  the  glory  of  God.  she  is  perpetually  sub- \n\njecting  herself  to  the  charge  of  unbelief,  together \n\nwith  all  her  powers,  desires  and  endeavours.1 \nFifth  bolt.  But  what  will  the  defenders  of  Freewill  say  at \nlast  to  that  which  follows;  \"  being  justified  freely \nby  his  grace  ?\"  What  is  this  \"  freely  ?\"  What \nis  this  \"  by  his  grace  ?\"  How  do  endeavour  and \nmerit  square  with  a  gratuitous  and  freely  given \nrighteousness?  Perhaps  they  will  say  here,  that \nthey  ascribe  the  least  tiling  possible  to  Freewill ; \nby  no  means  a  merit  of  condignity.  But  these \nare  empty  words ;  for  the  very  aim  of  Freewill \nis  to  make  room  for  merit.  This  has  been  Dia- \ntribe's perpetual  complaint  and  expostulation — \n'  If  there  be  not  freedom  in  the  will,  what  place \nis  there  for  merit  ?  If  there  be  not  place  for  merit, \nwhat  place  for  reward  ?  To  what  shall  it  be  im- \nputed, if  a  man  is  justified  without  merit  V \n\nPaul  replies  here,  that  there  is  absolutely  no \nsuch  thing  as  merit,  but  that  all  men  are  justified \nfreely,  as  many  as  are  justified;  and  that  this  is  not \nimputed  to  any  thing  but  the  grace  of  God  :  but \nwith  the  gift  of  righteousness  is  bestowed  at  the \nsame  time  the  kingdom,  and  eternal  life.  Where \nis  now  the  endeavour,  the  desire,  the  pains,  and \nthe  merit  of  Freewill?  What  is  the  use  of  these \nthings?  You  cannot  complain  of  obscurity  and \nambiguity;  the  matter  and  the  words  are  most \nclear  and  most  simple.  For  what  if  they  do  attri- \nbute the  least  thing  possible  to  Freewill ;  still  they \nteach  us  that  we   can   obtain  righteousness  and \n\nf  It  will  be  seen  presently,  that  I  consider  Luther  wrong  in \nthe  account  which  he  here  gives  of  \"  the  glory  of  God  j  but  he \njs  excessive  and  erroneous,  even  upon  his  own  representation  of \nhis  thunderbolt.  Freewill,  he  says,  is  evil  because  destitute  of \n{  the  glory  of  God  3'  by  which  he  understands  e  assurance  that \nwe  please  God.'  She  is  in  fact  guilty  of  unbelief,  in  not  having \nit.  This  is  outrageous  :  because  faith  is  not  '  I  believe  God \nhas  a  favour  to  me  ,'  but  '  I  believe  in  God  :'  neither  is  it  true \nthat  God  has  a  favour  to  every  body.  What  are  Luther's  repro- \nbates?  Then,  if  every  body  is  to  believe  this,  many  are  to \nbelieve  a  lie. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  417 \n\ngrace  by  this  very  little  thing.     For  they  do  not  sec.xvi. \nresolve  that  question  c  Why  does  God  justify  this \nman  and  leave  the  other  in  his  sins/  otherwise \nthan  by  setting  up  Freewill ;  that  is  to  say,  that \nthe  one  man  has  endeavoured,  and  the  other  has \nnot :  and  that  God  respects  the  one  of  these  cha- \nracters for  his  endeavour,  and  despises  the  other, \nthat  he  may  not  be  unjust,  as  he  would  be  if  he  acted \notherwi se.   Yea  altho ugh  they  pretend  both  in  their \nwritings  and  in  their  speakings,  that  they  do  not \nobtain  grace  by  merit  of  condignity,  and  do  not \ncall  it  merit  of  condignity,  still  they  mock  us  with \na  word,  and  do  not  less  hold  fast  the  thing.     For \nwhat  excuse  is  it,  that  they  do  not  call  it  merit  of \ncondignity,  when  they  still  ascribe  to  it  every  thing \nwhich  belongs  to  merit  of  condignity  ?    for  in- \nstance, that  he  who  endeavours  finds  favour  with \nGod ;    he   who    does   not  endeavour  finds  none. \nIs  not  this  plainly  merit  of  worth  ?     Do  they  not \nmake  God  a  respecter  of  works,  of  merits,  and  of \npersons  ?     For  instance ;  that  the  one  has  himself \nto  blame  for  lacking  grace,  because  he  hath  not \nendeavoured ;  the  other,  because  he  hath  endea- \nvoured, gets  grace  ;  who  wTould  not  have  had  ity  if \nhe  had  not  endeavoured.     If  this  be  not  merit  of \nworth,  I  should  be  glad  to  know  what  can  be \ncalled  merit  of  worth.     You  might  trifle  in  this \nmanner  with  all  sorts  of  words,  and  say,  it  is  not \nindeed  really  merit  of  condignity^  but  it   does \nwhat  merit  of  condignity  usually  does.    The  thorn \nis  not  a  bad  tree,  it  only  does  what  a  bad  tree \ndoes.     The   fig-tree  is  not  a  sound  tree,  but  it \ndoes  what   a  good  tree  usually  does.     Diatribe \nforsooth  is  not  an  abandoned  woman,  but   only \nsays  and  does  what  abandoned  women  are  wont \nto*do.g \n\n£  Luther's  bolts  are  five  ;  1.  The  righteousness  of  God  is \nhere  declared  to  he  perfectly  distinct  from  the  righteousness \nof  the  law.  1.  Whatsoever  is  not  of  faith  is  sin.  3.  All  have \nsinned.     4.  All  have  come  short  of  the  glory  of  God.     5.  The \n\n2e \n\n\n418  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.       These  defenders  of  Freewill  have  met  with  the \n\n■  misfortune  described   in   that   old   saying.    '  He \n\nsc  xvii.  J     &? \n\njustified  are  all  justified  freely. — I  should  rather  consider  this \n\nSophists       magnificent  and  comprehensive  passage  as  one  vast  bolt ;  the \n\nrt,0Ip  fhan  very  emission   of  which  lays  Freewill   prostrate,    because    it \n\n.e    e  a\"      declares  what  her  state  was,  to  give  occasion  to  such  emission. \n<-ricins. \n\nThis  vast  bolt,  however,  may  be  considered  as  expanding  itself \n\ninto  several  smaller  bolts,  each  of  which  contuses  Freewill. — \nLuther  breaks  the  shock  of  this  bolt,  in  some  measure,  by  not \nexactly  discerning  the  order  of  the  Apostle's  argument.  He  con- \nsiders Paul  as  speaking  of  the  preached  Gospel,  in  its  reception \nand  effects,  from  chap.  i.  16 ;  whereas  from  i.  18.  to  iii.  20.  he  is \nsetting  out  the  condemnation  of  all  men,  first  of  the  Greek, \nand  secondly  of  the  Jew,  as  without  the  Gospel :  and  then, \nhaving  previously  shewn  that  there  is  nothing  but  condemna- \ntion without  it,  both  without  and  with  the  law,  he  proceeds  to \nopen  the  Gospel  as  the  revelation  of  the  counsel  and  perform- \nances of  God's  free  favour,  with  which  Freewill  neither  has, \nnor  can  have,  any  thing  to  do ;  and  which  her  necessities  have \nrendered  necessary,  if  every  individual  of  mankind — already \nshewn  to  be  in  a  damned  state — were  not  to  be  continued  in \nthat  damned  state  for  ever  and  ever. — Some  of  his  bolts  also \nI  consider  Luther  as  interpreting  erroneously ;  whilst  each, \ntruly  interpreted,  is  a  bolt  indeed  ! \n\n\"  But  now  the  righteousness  of  God  without  the  law  is \nmanifested,  being  witnessed  by  the  law  and  the  Prophets.\" \nThe  righteousness  of  God  is  that  righteousness  which  God \nfreely  bestows  ;  which,  on  many  accounts,  might  specially  be \ncalled  his  ;  but  which  is  specially  so  called,  in  opposition  to \nman's  own  righteousness — a  law  righteousness — the  result  of \na  man's  own  personal  obedience.  \"  Not  having  mine  own \nrighteousness  which  is  of  the  law,  but  that  which  is  through \nthe  faith  of  Christ,  the  righteousness  which  is  of  God  by \nfaith.\"  (Phil.  iii.  9.) — Luther  speaks  much  of  distinctness  and \nopposition,  but  he  did  not  discern  the  extent  of  this  ;  and  was \nfor  bringing  the  law  in  again,  after  having  cast  it  out.  But \nthe  words  x^P19  v^lH  banish  all  connection  with  the  law  for \never ;  just  as  x^P19  XPLa~*  (Ephes.  ii.  12.)  and  x^P^  ^f1*  (John \nxv.  5.)  declare  entire  severance  from  Christ :  indeed  what  is \nseverance,  except  it  be  perfect  ? — \"  Even  the  righteousness  of \nGod,  which  is  b}r  faith  of  Jesus  Christ,  unto  all  and  upon  all \nthem  that  believe.\" — I  say,  by  the  faith  of  Jesus  Christ,  mean- \ning the  Gospel,  as  strictly  opposed  to  the  Law,  and  so  pre- \nserving a  distinctness  from  that  which  follows,  \"  them  that \nbelieve\" — the  distinguishing  character  of  those  to  whom  the \nGospel  is  made  the  power  of  God  unto  salvation  :  it  is  unto \nthese — preached  especially  for  their  benefit — they  are  as  it  were \nits  point  of  rest  -,  and  upon  these — they  are  efficaciously,  con- \nsciously, and  manifestatively  invested  with  it,  even   as  they \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  419 \n\nfalls  into  Scylla  by  wishing  to  avoid  Charybdis/  SC.  xvii. \nThrough  a  desire   of  dissenting  from  the  Pela-  \n\nhave  covenantly,  secretly,  and  to  the  eye  of  God  and  his  Christ, \npossessed  it  from  all  eternity.  \"  Inherit  the  kingdom  prepared \nfor  you  from  the  foundation  of  the  world  ;\"'  \"  According  to  his \nown  purpose  and  grace  which  was  given  us  in  Christ  Jesus  before \nthe  world  began/' — (Matt.  xxv.  34.  2  Tim.  i.  9.) — !C  For  there \nis  no  difference  :  for  all  have  sinned,,  and  come  short  of  the \nglory  of  God.\"  The  Jew  and  the  Greek  are  invested  with \nthis  righteousness  alike,  through  the  instrumentality  of  this \npreached  Gospel  :  He  is  hereby  shewn  and  declared  to  be  the \nGod  of  the  Gentile  as  well  as  of  the  Jew,  and  to  be  no  respecter \nof  persons  ;  even  as  all — that  is,  both  Jew  and  Gentile  alike — \nhare  manifested  themselves  to  be  sinners,  and  nothing  but \nsinners  (for  those  who  had  the  law  transgressed  it,  as  well  as \nthose  who  had  it  not),  so  proving  that  there  was  no  possibility  of \nacceptance  with  God — that  is,  of  being  made  righteous — in  any \nother  way.  I  consider  the  sin  here  spoken  of  to  be  the  sin \ncommitted  by  every  individual  man  whilst  living  and  acting \nin  this  world,  which  rendered  it  impossible  that  he  should \nobtain  the  glory  of  God  en  a  law  ground,  even  if  his  original \nsin  and  guilt  were  remitted  :  which  it  was  the  special  design \nof  the  law  covenant  and  dispensation  to  make  manifest.  The \nword  fjuapTov  denotes  a  time  prior  to  this  manifestation  of \nGod's  righteousness  :  it  is  not  are  sinning,  or  have  sinned,  but \nhave  in  time  past  been  sinning — as  the  Apostle  has  shewn  dis- \ntinctly of  both  these  parties,  which  together  constitute  the \nwhole  human  race — and  are  now  therefore  \"  left  behind  in  the \nrace\"  by  the  glory  of  God.  This  is  the  proper  import  of  the \nword  va-eplv-at :  which  applies  specially  to  the  Jews  who  had \nthe  covenant  of  eternal  life — that  is,  i:  of  the  glory  of  God\" — \nproposed  to  them,  on  the  ground  of  their  own  personal  obe- \ndience ■  which  could  not  be  so  properly  said  of  the  Gentiles, \nwhilst  their  conduct  had  been  such  as  to  make  it  manifest  that \nthey  could  have  no  claim  under  such  a  covenant  if  they  had \nbeen  allowed  to  be  candidates  and  competitors  for  its  prize. — \nI  do  not  accord  with  Luther  in  his  idea  of  this  glory  :  it  is  the \nsame  thing  which  is  spoken  of,  Horn.  v.  2.  (\"  rejoice  in  hope \nof  the  glory  of  God\"),  and  in  1  Peter  v.  1.  (\"  a  partaker  of \nthe  glory  which  shall  be  revealed.\")  It  is  that  manifested \nexcellency  which  God  has  provided  for  his  people  :  and  which \nis  with  the  greatest  fitness  called  His  glory — the  glory  of \nGod — because  the  state  into  which  He  will  in  due  time  intro- \nduce his  human  people  will  be  one  of  His  most  glorious  mam- \nfesters  :  they  will  in  their  measure,  both  individually  and  col- \nlectively, when  thus  brought  into,  and  displayed  in,  the  com- \npleteness of  their  union  with  the  Image  of  the  Invisible  One, \nshew  Him  forth  as  He  is.  By  this  glory — which,  if  it  be  to \nbe  received  upon  a  law  ground,  requires  spotless  perfection \n\n~2e2 \n\n\n420  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npartv.  gians,  they  began  with  denying  merit  of  condig- \nnity,  and,  by  the  very  ground  on\" which  they  deny, \n\nin  him  who  wins  it — they  had  all  been  outstripped  and  over- \ncome, so  as  to  have  no  part  in  it. — \"  Being  justified  freely  by \nhis  grace  through  the  redemption  which  is  in  Christ  Jesus.\" \nThese  words  open  the  nature  of  God's  righteousness,  as  well  as \nthe  origin  and  ground  of  its  bestowal.  Justified  is  from  the  same \nroot  with  righteousness,  and  expresses  properly  '  making  the \nunjust  just :'  it  is  God's  method  of  absolving  a  sinner  from  his \noffences  by  taking  them  clean  away  ;  the  origin  of  this  removal \nis  free  favour,  and  the  way  of  it  is  Christ's  blood-shedding.  It  is \na  cleansing  which  we  receive  without  money  and  without \nprice,  from,  and  unto  the  display  of,  that  portion  of  God \nwhich  we  distinguish  by  the  name  of  grace  ;  but  it  is  a  cleans- \ning which  he  has  rendered  himself  just  in  freely  bestowing — \nthat  is,  which  he  freely  bestows  in  perfect  consistency  with \nhis  justice — through  the  price  which  Christ  paid,  by  joining \nhimself  to  them  in  their  damned  state,  living  with  them  as \nThe  Righteous  One  in  and  under  their  curse,  and  at  length \ndying  with  them,  and  for  them,  a  death  of  shame,  agony,  and \ncomplicated  torments.  The  expression  is  peculiar,  \"  The \nredemption  which  is  in  Christ  Jesus  ;\"  marking  the  peculiar \nand  elect  objects  of  this  redemption :  it  is  a  deliverance, \nthrough  payment  of  a  valuable  consideration,  had  and  received \nby  means  of  union  with  Christ  Jesus — sought  and  obtained, \ntherefore,  for  those  only,  to  whom  the  Father  (as  both  Covenant \nand  Scripture  speak)  hath  vouchsafed  this  most  precious  of  all \ngifts,  which  implies  and  conveys  all  the  rest — union  with,  being \nin,  Christ.  <(  According  as  he  hath  chosen  us  in  Him' — that  is,  to \nbe  in  Him;  that  we  should  be  in  Him — \"before  the  foundation \nof  the  world.\" — Hereby,  as  it  is  afterwards  declared,  God  is \nshewn  to  be  righteous,  though  the  justifier  of  sinners ;  who \nare  manifested  to  have  had  this  covenant  union,  of  His  free \ngift,  from  everlasting,  and  therefore  to  have  been  of  the  num- \nber of  those,  for  the  sake  of  whom  He  did  so  come,  live,  and \ndie — by  having  faith  given  to  them  in  clue  season,  through  the \nregeneration  and  within  agency  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  and  so \ndifferencing  themselves  from  others,  to  whom,  according  to \nthe  will  of  God,  the  free  grace  proclamation  is  made,  and  the \nsecond  universal  commandment  (which  the  more  private  and \npeculiar  one  of  the  law  had  established  to  be  the  only  prac- \nticable method  of  salvation  and  glory) — Repent  ye  and  believe \nthe  Gospel — hath  been  in  common  with  them  delivered,  whilst \nit  is  by  them  exclusively  obeyed. \n\nThus  doth  this  ordnance  text  of  Luther's  fire  a  sort  of  volley \nagainst  Freewill,  of  which  every  shot  is  death.  e  Righteous- \nness of  God' — c  without  the  law ' — e  the  faith  of  Jesus  Christ' — • \nall  them  that  believe ' — '  no  difference ' — '  all  have  sinned ' — '  all \ncome  short  of  glory' — ( justified  freely'— '  by  His  grace' — \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  421 \n\ndo  more  strongly  affirm  it;  denying  with  word  SC. xvn. \nand  pen  what  in  reality  and  in  heart  they  affirm, \nand  making  themselves  twofold  worse  than  the \nPelagians.  First,  inasmuch  as  the  Pelagians  sim- \nply, candidly,  and  ingenuously  confess  and  assert \nmerit  of  condignity,  calling  a  boat  a  boat,  a  fig- \ntree  a  fig-tree;  and  teaching  what  they  think.  But \nour  friends,11  though  they  think  and  teach  the  same \nthing  as  these,  beguile  us  meanwhile  with  lying \nwords,  and  with  a  false  shew  of  dissenting  from  the \nPelagians,  when  in  reality  they  do  nothing  less  than \nthis ;  so  that,  if  you  look  at  the  character  we  per- \nsonate, you  see  in  us  the  most  determined  ene- \nmies of  the  Pelagians  ;  if  you  look  at  our  real \nmind,  we  are  double  Pelagians.  Secondly,  inas- \nmuch as,  by  this  assumption,  we  estimate  and \npurchase  the  grace  of  God  at  a  far  lower  rate \nthan  the  Pelagians.  They  assert,  that  it  is  not \nsome  small  thing  which  is  in  us,  whereby  we  ob- \ntain grace,  but  many  great,  whole,  full,  and  per- \nfect endeavours  and  performances.  Our  friends, \non  the  contrary,  account  it  to  be  a  very  small \nthing,  and  next  to  nothing,  by  which  we  earn \ngrace. \n\nIf  we  must  be  in  error  therefore,  those  persons \nerr  more  honestly  and  with  less  pride,  who  affirm \nthat  the  grace  of  God  is  purchased  at  a  great \nprice,  reckoning  it  to  be  dear  and  precious ;  than \nthose  who  teach  that  it  is  bought  for  a  little,  and \nfor  a  very  little,  accounting  it  mean  and  con- \ntemptible.    But  Paul  beats  them  both  together \n\n*■  through  the  redemption' — '  a  propitiation  by  blood' — e  that \nhe  might  be  just' — '  the  justifier  of  him  that  believeth: '  here \nare  no  less  than  thirteen  bolts,  thirteen  death-blows  for  Free- \nwill, whilst  the  very  existence  of  the  Gospel  declares  the  Free- \nwill state  of  those  to  whom  it  is  sent. \n\nh  Nostri  verb.']  Friends,  inasmuch  as  they  profess  to  be  anta- \ngonists of  the  Pelagians  together  with  us. — What  follows — '  si \nhypocrisin  spectes' — c  hac  hypocrisi' — is  by  a  figure  taken \nfrom  the  histrionic  art  j  that  peculiar  species  of  simulation,  of \nwhich  the  stage-player  is  guilty,  when  he  puts  on  his  mask, \nand  personates  a  character  in  the  drama. \n\n\n422  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.    into  one  mass  by  a  single  word,  when  he  says \n\n'  that  \"  all  are  justified  freely  ;\"  and  again,  \"  that \n\nthey  are  justified  without  the  law  ;\"  \"  without  the \ndeeds  of  the  law.\"  In  asserting  a  free  justifica- \ntion as  the  justifier  of  all  men,  he  leaves  none  to \nwork,  or  merit,  or  prepare  themselves,  and  leaves \nno  work  that  can  be  called  congruous  or  de- \nserving, but  breaks  in  pieces,  by  one  stroke  of \nthis  thunderbolt,  both  the  Pelagians  with  their \nentire  merit,  and  the  Sophists  with  their  little  modi- \ncum of  merit.  Free  justification  does  not  allow \nyou  to  set  up  workers  of  any  sort ;  inasmuch  as \ni  free  gift/  and  f  prepare  yourself  by  some  work/ \nare  manifest  opposites.  Again;  justification  by \ngrace  allows  not  of  any  personal  worthiness :  as \nhe  says  afterwards  also,  in  chap.  xi.  u  If  by  grace, \nthen  is  it  no  more  of  works ;  otherwise  grace  is \nno  more  grace ;\"  just  as  also  in  chap.  iv.  he \nsays,  \"  Now  to  him  that  worketh  is  the  reward \nreckoned,  not  of  grace,  but  of  debt.\"  So  that \nmy  friend  Paul  stands  up  as  the  invincible  de- \nstroyer of  Freewill,  laying  two  whole  armies  flat \non  their  faces,  with  a  single  word.  For  if  we  be \njustified  without  works,  all  works  are  condemned, \nboth  small  and  great;  he  excepts  none,  but  ful- \nminates equally  against  all. \nsc.xviii.

As  if,  forsooth,  the  man  who  denies \nthat  we  are  supplied  with  the  greater  things,  and \nthe  all  things  which  are  necessary  to  justifica- \ntion, doth  not  much  more  deny,  that  we  are  supplied \nwith  the  little  things  and  the  few — when  he  is \nmaintaining  all  the  while,  that  we  are  justified \nonly  by  his  grace,  without  works  of  any  kind, \nand  even  without  the  law  itself;  in  which  all \nworks,  both  great  and  small,  both  works  of  con- \ngruity,  and  works  of  condignity,  are  compre- \nhended?— Go  now  and  boast  of  the  authority  of \nthe  ancients,  and  trust  to  their  sayings;  all  of \nwhom  to  a  man,  as  you  perceive,  have  overlooked \nPaul,  that  most  clear  and  explicit  doctor !  Nay, \nthey  have,  as  it  were,  designedly  got  out  of  the \nway  of  this  day-star,  or  rather  of  this  sun ; \nbeing  engrossed,  forsooth,  with  the  carnal  imagin- \nation, that  it  seemed  absurd  there  should  be  no \nplace  left  for  merits. \n\nLet  me  adduce  the  example  of  Abraham,  which  Paul's  rita- \nPaul  subsequently  adduces.     u  If  Abraham,  says  example  of \n\nchapter,  as  also  in  chapters  x.  xi.

For  what  saith  the  Scripture  ? \n\nMarched1     Abraham  believed  God,   and  it  was  counted  to \n\nand  ap-       him  for  righteousness.\" \n\nphed.  Here  again,  observe  Paul's  division;  he  dis- \n\ntinctly mentions  two  righteousnesses  of  Abraham : \none  of  works,  which  is  moral  and  civil,  but  by \nwhich  he  denies  that  he  was  justified  before  God, \nthough  just  before  men  by  it.  Moreover,  he  has \nglory  with  men,  although  even  this  man  also \ncomes  short  of  the  glory  of  God,  by  this  righte- \nousness. Nor  can  any  one  say,  that  the  works1 \nof  the  ceremonial  law  are  here  condemned  ;  since \nAbraham  lived  so  many  years  before  the  law. \nPaul  speaks  simply  of  the  works  of  Abraham; \nand  those,  none  other  than  his  best.  It  would  be \nridiculous  to  reason  whether  a  man  be  justified  by \nbad  works.  If  then  Abraham  be  not  just  by  any \nworks  of  his,  but,  except  he  be  clothed  with \nanother  righteousness,  that  of  pure  faith,  be  left, \nboth  as  to  his  person  and  as  to  all  his  works, \nunder  the  charge  of  ungodliness ;  it  is  plain,  that \nno  man  makes  any  advances  towards  righteous- \nness, by  his  own  works:  and  further,  that  no \nworks,  no  desires,  no  endeavours  of  Freewill  are \nof  any  avail  before  Gocl;  but  are  all  accounted \nungodly,  unjust  and  wicked.  If  the  man  be  not \njust,  his  works  and  desires  are  not  just;  if  not \njust,  they  are  damnable,  and  worthy  of  wrath. \nThe  other  righteousness  is  that  of  faith,  which  doth \nnot  stand  in  any  works,  but  in  God's  favour  and \nmanner  of  accounting  of  us,  through  grace.  And \nsee  how  Paul  dwells  upon  that  word  e  accounting \n\n1  Gloriam  apud  homines.  Facat  gloria  Dei.~]  Here  again,  Lu- \nther has  the  mistake  already  noticed  (see  notes  §  h),  respecting \nthe  glory  of  God.  It  is  quite  in  another  sense  that  all  are  said \nto  come  short,  and  Abraham  not  to  boast.  He  had  no  cause \nof  boasting  before  God,  because  he  was  not  justified  to  God  by \nhis  works  ;  else  he  would  have  had  :  as  he  might  boast  him- \nself before  men,  because  he  was  shewing  himself  to  be  one \njustified  to  God,  by  his  works  done  after  justification. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  425 \n\nof  us  ';*  how  lie  urges,  repeats,  and  beats  it  into     sect. \nus.  XIX- \n\n\"  To  him  who  worketh,  says  he,  is  the  reward  \" \nreckoned  not  of  grace  but  of  debt.  But  to  him  that \nworketh  not,  but  believeth  on  him  who  justifieth \nthe  ungodly,  his  faith  is  counted  for  righteous- \nness ;  according  to  the  purpose  of  the  grace  of \nGod.\"  Then  he  adduces  David  speaking  in  like \nmanner  of  the  reckoning  of  grace ; m  and  saying, \n\"  Blessed  is  the  man  to  whom  the  Lord  hath  not \nimputed  sin,  &c.\" \n\nNearly  ten  times  in  that  same  chapter  he  re- \npeats the  word  '  imputation/  To  be  short;  Paul \ncompares  the  worker  and  the  non-worker :  leav- \ning none  between  these  two.  He  denies  that \nrighteousness  is  imputed  to  the  worker:  to  the \nnon-worker  he  asserts  that  righteousness  is  im- \nputed, if  he  but  believe.  It  is  not  possible  for \nFreewill  to  escape  or  slip  away  here  with  her \nendeavour,  or  pains :  for  she  must  be  numbered \neither  with  the  worker,  or  the  non-worker.  If \nwith  the  worker,  you  hear  in  this  place  that  no \nrighteousness  is  imputed  to  her;  if  with  the  non- \nworker,  who  however  believes  in  God,  righteous- \nness is  imputed  to  her.  But  then  she  will  not  be \nFreewill ;  she  will  be  the  new  creature — the  soul \nrenewed  by  faith. n  Now,  if  righteousness  be  not \nimputed  to  him  that  worketh,  it  is  plain  that  his \nworks  are  nothing  but  sins,  wicked  \"and  ungodly \nacts  in  the  sight  of  God. \n\nNor  is  it  possible  for  any  Sophist  to  turn  saucy, \nand   say,   '  though  the  man  be  wicked,  yet  his \n\nm  Reputatione  gratia.']  (  The  account  which  grace  takes  of \ncharacter:' — rep.  is  most  correctly  englished  by  '  reckon ,' \nbut  Luther  uses  it  throughout  the  whole  of  this  passage  inter- \nchangeably with  '  imputo.' \n\nn  Renovata  creatura  per  fidem^]  As  if  the  Lord's  people  were \nrenewed  by  faith  !  whence  conies  their  faith  then  ?  So  he \nhad  said  above,  acquiescing  in  Erasmus's  term,  '  renatus  per \nfidem  ;'  which  I  there  called  ambiguous,  but  we  now  see  to \nhave  been  meant  wrongly. — See  above.

Sect.  xlv. \nnote  t. \n\n\n426 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n\npart  v.   work  may  not  be  wicked/  For  Paul  lays  hold,  not \n\non  the  person  of  the  man  simply,  but  on  the  man \n\nat  work,  for  this  very  purpose,  that  he  may  de- \nclare in  the  most  explicit  terms,  how  that  the  very \nworks  and  endeavours  of  the  man  are  condemned, \nwhatsoever  those  may  be,  and  under  whatsoever \nname  or  species  they  may  be  classed.  Moreover, \nit  is  of  good  works  that  he  treats,  because  it  is  of \njustification  and  merit  that  he  is  discoursing — \nand  when  he  speaks  of  a  man  that  worketh,  he \nspeaks  universally  of  all  working  men,  and  of  all \ntheir  works  ;  but  especially  of  good  and  honest \nworks  :  else  his  division  into  worker  and  non- \nworker  would  not  stand. \n\nI  here  omit  those  most  powerful  arguments \nwhich  are  drawn  from  the  purpose  of  grace,  from \npromise,  from  the  power  of  the  law,  from  original \nsin,  and  from  the  election  of  God  ;  of  which  there \nis  not  one,  but  what  alone,  and  by  itself,  utterly \ntakes  away  Freewill.  For  if  grace  comes  from \nthe  purpose  or  predestination  of  God,  it  comes \nby  necessity,  not  by  our  pains  or  endeavour;  as \nI  have  already  shewn.  So,  if  God  promised \ngrace  before  the  law,  as  Paul  argues  both  here \nand  in  Galatians ;  then  it  does  not  come  from  our \nworks,  or  from  the  law ;  else  the  promise  will  be \nnothing.  So,  faith  also  will  be  nothing  (yet  it  is \nsaid  that  Abraham  was  justified  by  it  before  the \nlaw),  if  works  have  any  efficacy.  So,  whereas  the \nlaw  is  the  strength  of  sin,  only  manifesting,  and  not \ntaking  away,  sin ;  it  makes  the  conscience  guilty \nbefore  God,  and  threatens  wrath :  this  is  what  is \nmeant  by  that  saying,  \"  The  law  worketh  wrath.\" \nHow  then  could  it  be,  that  righteousness  is  ob- \ntained by  the  law  ?  And,  if  we  are  not  profited \nby  the  law,  how  can  we  be  profited  by  Freewill \nwhen  acting  without  it.0 \n\n\nSEC.  xx. \n\nLuther \nomits \nmuch \nwhich  he \nmight  in- \nsist upon. \n\n\n0  '  No  Freewill*  follows  from  God's  \"  purpose  and  grace  :\" \n\"  Whom  he  did  foreknow,  them  he  did  predestinate ;  whom \nhe  did  predestinate,  them  he  also  called.\"     The  calling  is  of \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  427 \n\nAgain ;  seeing,  we  are  all  under  sin  and  damn-  SEC»  xx« \n\nation  through  the  one  offence    of  the  one   man  \n\nAdam,  how  can  we  attempt  any  thing  which  is \nnot  sin,  and  which  is  not  damnable  ?  For  when \nhe  says  all,  he  excepts  no  one  ;  neither  the  power \nof  Freewill,  nor  any  workman ;  whether  he  work \nor  work  not,  endeavour  or  endeavour  not,  he  will \nnecessarily  be  comprehended  amongst  the  all, \nwith  the  others.  Nor  could  we  have  sinned, \nand  been  condemned,  by  that  single  sin  of \nAdam's,  unless  it  were  our  sin.  For  who  could \nbe  condemned  for  another  man's  sin,  especially \nin  the  sight  of  God?  But  that  sin  is  not  made \nours  by  imitation,  or  by  some  subsequent  act  of \nours  ;  since  this  could  not  be  that  one  sin  of \nAdam,  as  being  that  which  we,  and  not  he,  hath \ndone  :  it  becomes  ours,  by  birth.  But  this  is  not \nthe  place  for  discussing  that  question.  However, \noriginal  sin  suffers  not  that  Freewill  do  any  thing \nelse,  save  sin  and  be  damned.p \n\npredestination  therefore,  not  of  Freewill  j  \"  according  to  the \neternal  purpose  which  he  purposed  in  Christ  Jesus  our  Lord.\" \n— f  No  Freewill'  follows  from  God's  promise,  which  was  ante- \ncedent to  the  law,  and  therefore  cannot  be  dependent  upon  our \nworks ;  which  are  by  the  law  :  indeed,  in  its  very  nature,  as \nPaul  argues,  promise  is  opposed  to  work. — '  No  Freewill'  fol- \nlows from  faith  (\"  the  just  shall  live  by  faith  5\"  \"  they  which \nbe  of  faith  are  blessed  with  faithful  Abraham\")  ;  of  which  the \nlaw — that  is,  works — is  not.  (Galat.  iii.  11,12.) — c  No  Free- \nwill '  follows  from  the  law  :  for  even  the  knv  worketh  wrath — \nand  yet  she  is  a  help ;  Freewill  does  not  even  know  what  sin \nis,  without  her. \n\np  Luther  has  his  eye,  all  the  way,  upon  Romans  v.  12 — 19. \nHis  account  is,  Adam's  sin  is  ours  '  nascendo — by  our  being \nborn  of  him,  as  we  are  ;  bom  of  him  who  did  it:  making  us \nvoluntary  agents  in  being  born,  and  God  the  propagator  of  sin, \nin  causing  that  we  should  be  born  from  him — or,  as  he  has \ndescribed  it,  making  us  out  of  him.  (See  above,  Part  iv. \nSect,  x.j  and,  for  objections  to  his  statement,  note  z  there- \nupon.) However,  Luther's  conclusion  is  right,  though  he \narrives  less  correctly  at  it  :  the  truth  is,  we  are  born  having \npreviously  sinned,  guilty,  \"\"  children  of  wrath  ;\"  how  then  can \nwe  do  any  thing  good  ?  Luther — how  near  is  he  to  the  truth, \nyet  does  not  reach  it  !  Observe,  he  will  not  have  it  e  sin  after \nbirth/  and  he  will  have  it  e  our  own  and  not  Adam's  only  :'  but \n\n\n428  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  These  arguments,  then,  I  omit,  because  they  are \n'  most  manifest,  and  most  powerful:  besides,  I  have \nsaid  something  about  them  already.  Now,  if  I \nhad  a  mind  to  recite  all  that  Paul  only  has  said \nto  the  subversion  of  Freewill,  I  could  not  do  this \nbetter,  than  by  discussing  the  whole  of  Paul's \nwritings  in  the  form  of  a  perpetual  commentary, \nand  shewing  that  this  so  vaunted  power  of  Free- \nwill is  confuted  in  almost  every  single  word  of \nhis  :  just  as  I  have  done  in  these  third  and  fourth \nchapters.  My  special  object  in  thus  exhibiting \nthese  chapters  has  been ;  first,  to  shew  the  stupid \ndrowsiness  with  which  we  have  all  nodded  over \nhis  writings — reading  them,  clear  as  they  are,  in \nsuch  a  way  as  not  to  have  the  least  idea  that  they \ncontain  the  strongest  possible  arguments  against \nFreewill — secondly,  to  shew  the  folly  of  that \nconfidence  which  leans  on  the  authority  and \nwritings  of  the  old  doctors — and  thirdly,  that  I \nmight  leave  it  as  matter  of  thought,  what  these \nmost  manifest  arguments  are  capable  of  eifecting, \nif  handled  with  diligence  and  judgment. \nsec. xxi.      For  my  own  part  I  am  greatly  astonished,  that, \n\nwhereas  Paul  so  often  uses  those  universal  terms \n\nLuther's      <  A11 ,    <  jjone/  <  Not/  <  Nowhere/  <  Without/ \n\nown  view  _  *    ■  .  y  y  n  i \n\nof  Paul.  as  for  instance,  \"  1  hey  are  all  gone  out  ot  the \nway,\"  \"  There  is  none  righteous,\"  \"  There  is \nnone  that  doeth  good,  no  not  one,\"  \"  All  have \nbeen  made  sinners,  and  damned,  by  the  offence  of \none.\"  \"  We  are  justified  by  faith  without  the  law, \nwithout  works;\"  (so  that,  if  a  man  had  a  mind  to \nspeak  otherwise,  he  could  not  however  speak  more \nclearly,  or  more  explicitly) ;  it  is  a  matter  of  sur- \nprise to  me,  I  say,  how  it  hath  come  to  pass,  that, \n\nhe  has  not  *  that  distinct  individuality  of  subsistence  given  to  us \nin  the  creation  of  the  Man,  which  makes  us  truly  one  with  him \nin  his  deed;'  neither  has  he  ( the  power  and  order  before \ngiven  ;'  neither  has  he  '  God's  veracity  to  be  shewn  in  inflict- \ning the  curse.'

But, \nin  fact,  he  uses  such  expressions  perpetually — \nand  not  only  so,  but  uses  both  affirmatives  and \nnegatives  together ;  so  handling  his  sentiment  in \na  way  of  contrast  and  distribution — by  which  he \narrays  the  several  parts  against  each  other,  on \nboth  sides — that  not  only  the  nature  of  the  words, \nand  the  sentence  itself,  but  the  subsequent,  pre- \nceding, and  immediate  context  also,  together  with \nthe  scope  and  very  body  of  the  whole  discussion, \nunite  in  establishing  one  common  conclusion,  that \nPaul  means,  '  without  faith  in  Christ  there  is \nnothing  but  sin  and  damnation. q     It  was  in  this \n\ni  The  words  above  cited  are  a  sufficient  illustration  of \nLuther's  meaning  in  the  several  terms — (  words/  (  sentence/ \n'  contrast/  f  division/  '  context/  '  scope/  c  discussion  at  large/ \n(  mind  of  the  writer.' — Extra  f idem  Christl,  I  translate  accord- \ning to  Luther's  meanings  not  according  to  my  own  view  of  the \nApostle's  argument.

I  think  I  have  done  so :  even  though  they \nshould  not  yield  to  my  sentiment,  as  vanquished ; \nor  hold  their  peace.  It  is  not  within  the  compass \nof  my  power  to  bring  them  to  this  :  this  is  the  gift \nof  God's  Spirit. \n\nBut,  before  we  hear  the  Evangelist  John,  let  us \nadd  PauPs  finish  to  his  argument  on  this  subject, \nas  contained  in  that  Epistle  •  prepared,  where  this \nshall  not  satisfy,  to  set  the  whole  of  Paul's \nwritings  in  array  against  Freewill,  by  a  perpetual \ncommentary.  In  Romans  viii.  after r  dividing  the \nwhole  human  race  into  two  parts,  flesh  and \nSpirit,  as  Christ  also  does  in  John  iii.  he  speaks \nthus  :  (  They  that  are  after  the  flesh  do  mind \nthe  things  of  the  flesh ;  but  they  that  are \nafter  the  Spirit  do  mind  the  things  of  the  Spirit/ \n\nsave  -,  the  Gospel  only  can.' — But  then,  that  this  Gospel  may \nsave,  e  it  must  be  believed  with  the  heart  {  '  Christ  must  be \nbelieved  in  and  into!  Under  the  right  interpretation  of  these \npassages  then,  two  steps  are  wanting  to  Luther's  conclusion, \n(  Paul  condemns  Freewill.'  Paul  says  only,  (  Without  the  faith \nof  Christ  there  is  nothing  but  sin  and  damnation.'  But  that \nfaith  must  be  received,  or  obeyed,  before  it  can  save ;  and  that \nreception  or  obedience  is  e  not  of  the  nature  power  of  Freewill, \nbut  of  the  supernature  power  of  God's  Spirit.' — There  are  texts, \nmore  than  enough,  to  prove  both  these  points  ;  I  would  rather \nsay,  Scripture  is  explicit  enough  in  her  witness  to  both  these \npoints — (\"Taking  vengeance  on  those  that  know  not  God,  and \nthose  that  obey  not  the  Gospel  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.\" — \n<e  No  man  can  come  unto  me,  except  the  Father,  which  hath \nsent  me,  draw  him:\")  so  that  there  can  be  no  question  what \nis  truth  in  this  matter  ;  though  Luther  does  not  come  at  his \nconclusion  legitimately,  through  misuse  of  his  premises. \n\nr  Ubi  genus.']  Referring  to  the  preceding  verses,  \"  Them \nwhich  are  in  Christ  Jesus  j  who  walk  not  after  the  flesh,  but \nafter  the  Spirit.\" — As  to  what  follows,  it  has  been  seen  already \n(Part  iv.  Sect.  xlii.  notes  '  k)  that  I  do  not  admit  the  parallel. \nPaul  clearly  divides  men  into  two  classes ;  but  the  Lord,  in \nJohn  iii.  is  shewing  the  necessity  of  a  new  and  spiritual \nbirth.  The  opposition  is  not  between  those  who  have,  and \nthose  who  have  not,  this  birth ;  but  between  nature  power  of \nprocreation,  and  Spirit  power  of  procreation  ;  Adam  produces \nhis  like,  and  the  Holy  Ghost  produces  His  like. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  431 \n\nThat  Paul,  here,  calls  all  carnal  who  are  not  spi-  sc.xxii. \nritual,  is  plain  both  from  the  division  and  oppo- \nsition  between  flesh  and  Spirit,  and  also  from \nPaul's  own  words  which  follow.  \"Ye  are  not \nin  the  flesh,  but  in  the  Spirit,  if  but  the  Spirit  of \nChrist  dwell  in  you.  Now  if  any  man  have  not \nthe  Spirit  of  Christ,  he  is  none  of  his.\"  For  what \nelse  does  he  mean  here,  by  the  words  '  Ye  are  not \nin  the  flesh,  but  in  the  Spirit/  than  that  those  who \nhave  not  the  Spirit  are  necessarily  in  the  flesh? \nBut  he  who  is  not  Christ's — whose  is  he  else,  than \nthe  devil's  ?  It  stands  good  therefore,  that  those \nwho  have  not  the  Spirit  are  in  the  flesh,  and  under \nSatan. \n\nLet  us  now  see^  what  he  thinks  of  the  endea- \nvour and  power  of  Freewill  in  the  carnal. \n\"  They  that  are  in  the  flesh  cannot  please  God.\" \nAnd  again ;  \"  The  mind  of  the  flesh  is  death :\" \nand  again,  \"  The  mind  of  the  flesh  is  enmity \nagainst  God.\"  Again,  \"It  is  not  subject  to  the \nlaw  of  God,  neither  indeed  can  be.\"5  Let  the \nadvocate  for  Freewill  answer  me  here,  how  that \nwhich  is  death,  which  is  displeasing  to  God,  which \nis  enmity  against  God,  which  is  disobedient  to \nGod,  and  which  cannot  obey  him ;  can  endeavour \nafter  good  !

He  had  been \ntempted  to  think  that  he  must  still  obey  the  law  ,•   and,  having \nbeen  put  upon  trying  to  do  this,  had  acquired  a  deep  know- \nledge of  his  own  state  :  which  is  also  that  of  every  called  child \nof  God.    He  discovered,  that  he  had  a  law  in  his  members  (his \nbody)  which  warred  against  the  law  of  his  mind,  and  brought \nhim  into  captivity  to  the  law  of  sin  which  was  in  his  mem- \nbers.    He  sighed  for  deliverance  from  that  body — fitly  called \na  dead  body — whose  law  made  him    so  wretched.     He  was \nassured  that  he  should  one  day  possess  it,  through  the  gift  of \nGod  in  Christ  Jesus.     At  present,  however,  his  state  was  that \nof  a  person  serving  two  laws,  in  the  two  distinct  parts  of  his \nframe.     But  still,  even  now,  he  was  not  condemned.     Why  ? \nbecause  he  was  a  man  in  Christ.*     Why,   as  a  man  in  Christ, \nhad  he  no  condemnation  ?    Because  the  Holy  Ghost,  as  had  by \nhim  in  Christ,  had  delivered  him  from  the  thraldom  and  bond- \nage of  that  law  which  still  reigned  in  his  members.     Why \nhad  he  the  Holy  Ghost  in  Christ  Jesus  ?     Because  God,  by \nsending  his  own  Son  in  flesh  of  sin,  had  condemned  sin  in \nthe  flesh  j  that  is,  had  executed  sentence  of  death  upon  this \nsinful  flesh,  and  could  now,  in  consideration  of  that  sentence \nso  borne,  raise  up  both  Him  and  that  people   for  whom  and \nwith  whom  he  had  borne  that  sentence,  into  a  new  state  of \nbeing,  in  which  they  should  be  the  subjects  of  spiritual  influ- \nences in  both   parts    of  their   frame :    in  whom   even    here, \nwhilst  tabernacling  in  their  flesh  of  sin,  the  foretaste  and  first- \nfruits  of  this  grace  is  shewn  in  their  being  renewed,  and  dwelt \nin,  by  the  Holy  Ghost,  f     Thus,  they  have  that  done  for  them \nwhich  the  law   could   not  do,  because  it  was  weak  through \nour   flesh's    being  what  it  is  ;  they  are  enabled  to  fulfil  the \nrighteousness  of  the  law — or  rather  to  yield  to  God  a  service \n\n*  I  perfectly  approve  Griesbach's  improved  reading,  which  casts  \"  Who \nwalk  not  after  the  flesh,  but  after  the  Spirit,\"  as  read  in  chap.  viii.  1. \ninto  the  interior  margin.  It  breaks  the  connection  of  the  argument;  and \nmay  very  naturally  he  supposed  to  have  been  interpolated  from  verse  4. \n\n•f  I  have  here  stated  the  reality,  which  is  more  commonly  set  forth  by  the \nHoly  Ghost  in  figure ;  the  dying,  quickening,  rising,  and  now  sitting  of  the \nLord's  elect  in  and  with  Him.  (See  Rom.  vi.  Ephes.  i.  ii.  Coloss.  ii.  iii.) \nGod's  eternal,  covenanted  design  of  raising  them  up,  in  Christ,  from  that \ndeath  into  which  they  were  contemplated  as  having  brought  themselves  by \ntheir  fall  in  and  withAdam,  is  the  basis  and  element  of  this  reality. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE;  433 \n\nsorts  of  affection,  one  of  which  is  called  the  flesh  by  SC.  xxu. \nhim  ;  another, the  soul ;  another,  the  spirit ;  and  of  ' \n\nwhich  is  far  more  righteous,  because  more  adapted  to  that  full \nmanifestation  which  He  has  now  made  of  himself,  than  a  law \nobedience  would,  or  could  be. — Hereafter,  as  he  proceeds  to \nshew  most  triumphantly,  in  the  progress  of  this  chapter,  the \nother  part  of  their  frame  will  also  have  its  triumph  :  the  body \nwhich  has  death  in  it,  and  has  yet  assuredly  to  die,  shall  be \nquickened  by  the  same  Spirit  which  hath  already  quickened \nand  dwelt  in  their  souls,  and  shall  live.    This,  which  had  been \nglanced  at  in  chap.  vii.  25.  and  is  so  distinctly  affirmed  in \nrv.  11.  21.  23.  of  this  chapter,  receives  its  seal  and  crown  in \n1  Cor.  xv.  where  the  paean  is  sung,  and  the  victory  ascribed  to \nits  giver  and  communicator.     \"  But  thanks  be  to  God  which \ngiveth  us  the  victory,  through  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.\" — I  have \nfound  it  impossible  to  render  a  consistent  account  of  these  two \nchapters  (to  which  the  precedent  sixth  may  be  added),  verse  by- \nverse,  and  clause  by  clause,  on  any  other  principle  than  this  -, \nwhich  makes  f  flesh'  the  substance  of  the  body,  and  e  spirit'  the \nrenewed  mind.  (See  Part  iv.  Sect,  xxxvii.  xli.  xlii.  and  much  that \nhas  elsewhere  gone  before.)    There  is  much  emphasis  in  verse  1 . \nHowbeit*  (that  is,  although  with  the  flesh  they  serve  the  law \nof  sin)  there  is  now  (opposed  to  I  thank  God,  chap.  vii.  25.  for \nwhat  shall  be)  no  condemnation   (all  these  out-breakings  and \nmanifestations  of  evil  are  forgiven,  and  not  allowed  abidingly \nto  mar  the  peace  of  their  souls — for  \"  Who  shall  lay  any  thing, \n&c.  &c.\"  viii.  33 — 39.)  to  them  which  are  in  Christ  Jesus.f    (It \nis  of  the  Lord's  called  that  he  here  bears  this  testismony,  as \nappears  from  the  context :  a  testimony,  which  is  in  the  Lord's \ntime  realized  to  all  his  elect,  and  for  the  same  reason — God \nhas  condemned  their  sin  which  is  in  their  flesh — \"  Who  is  he \nthat  condemneth  ?

(\"  Andronicus  and \nJunia. .  .  .who  also  were  in  Christ  before  me.\"  \"  I  knew  a  man  in  Christ, \n&c\")  A  third  state  maybe  distinguished  as  that  of  sacramental  union  (see \nPart  iv.  Sect.  xlv.  note  t),  which  is  distinct  and  separable  from  the  other  two  ?. \nbearing  analogy  to  that  entrance  which  the  Lord  had  into  his  kingdom,  by \nhis  baptism. — The  blessedness  here  described  belongs  to  his  called,  but  it  i& \nthe  ordained,  earned  and  waiting  portion  of  all  his  elect ;  who,  as  they  are \none  by  one  brought  by  the  Holy  Ghost  into  the  knowledge  of  this  grace, \nregard  themselves  as  those  who  have  virtually  died  in  and  with  Christ,  and \nwho  therefore  are  dead,  and  have  their  life  hid  with  Christ  in  God.  Hence \nthey  live  and  walk  after  that  part  of  their  frame  which  lives — into  which \nlife  has  already  been  introduced ;  not  according  to  that  which  is  virtually \ndead. \n\n2  p \n\n\n434  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  V.  which  the  soul  is  the  middle  one — what  may  be \n\nturned  towards  either  side,  the  flesh  or  the  spirit. \n\nBut  these  are  his  own  dreams ;  he  only  tells,  he \ndoes  not  prove  them.  Paul  here  calls  whatsoever  has \nnot  the  Spirit  flesh,  as  I  have  already  shewn.\"   So \n\nhabitual  deliverance  is  not  incompatible  with  an  occasional \nravished  subjection — such  as  he  has  described  in  chap.  vii.  The \nlaw  of  sin  and  death  is  clearly  the  law  of  evil  which  is  in  the  mem- \nbers, or  flesh,  or  body.  The  impossibility  of  the  law — the  law \ngave  no  power,  and  therefore  could  not  possibly  get  itself  to \nbe  obeyed  by  a  creature  whose  substance  is  such  as  fallen \nman's.  Likeness  of  flesh  of  sin  does  not  deny  reality  any  more \nthan  in  Philip,  ii.  7-  Condemned  etc.  not  only  passed  the  sen- \ntence but  inflicted  the  judgment.*  Righteousness  of  the \nlaw  is  not  what  is  commonly  meant  by  it,  '  the  act,  or \nground,  of  justification  5'  but  '  the  enactment' — e  the  matter  of \nthe  statute' — Biicaiw^a,  not  hacaioGvvn.  Wlio  ivalk — denoting \nhabitual  conduct,  aim  and  principle. — Their  conformity  with \nthe  law  is  circuitous,  not  direct  j  incidental,  not  deliberate \nand  designed.  They  \"walk  in  the  Spirit\"  (Gal.  v.  16.) ;  that \nis,  '  in  or  after  their  renewed  mind :'  just  as  it  is  said  here, \nWho  walk  not  after  the  flesh,  but  after  the  Spirit. — I  cannot \nforbear  remarking  what  a  close  parallel  that  whole  chapter \n(Gal.  v.)  is  to  this  seventh  and  eighth  of  Romans,  and  how  truly \nthe  whole  rule  or  law  of  the  Lord's  called  ones  (\"  Ye  have \nbeen  called  unto  liberty\")  is  set  out  in  the  four  words  which  I \nhave  recited  above.  For  what  is,  not  only  the  whole  law,  but \neven  the  whole  volume  of  Scripture  to  us,  save  so  far  as  it  is \napprehended  and  received  by  our  renewed  mind,  through  the \ninspiration  of  the  Holy  Ghost  ? \n\nu  I  cannot  agree  with  Luther  here.  Origen  is  more  nearly \nright  than  he,  if  by  soul  may  be  understood  ' the  will  with  its \naffections  'f  and  the  distinction  is  surely  recognised  in  Scrip- \nture, when  Paul  prays  for  the  Thessalonians  \"  that  their  whole \nspirit  and  soul  and  body  may  be  preserved  blameless  unto  the \ncoming  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.\"  (1  Thess.  v.  23.)  According \nto  Luther,  '  those  that  are  after  the  flesh,'  and  ( the  flesh,'  are \nthe  same  substance ;  whereas,  in  truth,  the  distinction  of  cha- \nracter is  made  by  these  constituent  parts  of  their  frame,  accord- \ning to  which  they  walk  (that  is,  habitually  act)  severally. \nThe  natural  man  (^xt/c^s)  liyes  a^er  ms  flesh,  and  is  carnal : \n\n*  Compare  1  Peter  iv.  1 — 6.  also  iii.  18 — 22.  «  Christ's  flesh  condemned, \nand  made  to  suffer  or  die,'  is  not  only  the  burden  of  Scripture,  but  the \nessence  of  the  reality  of  the  foundation  of  God's  new  creation  transactions \nin  Him :  even  as  the  knowledge  of  this  body  of  ours,  what  it  was  in  its \nformation,  what  it  was  in  and  became  by  the  Fall,  what  it  is  to  the  unregene- \nrate,  and  specially  what  it  is  to  the  regenerated  sons  and  daughters  of \nAdam,  is  one  of  the  great  keys  to  the  mystery  of  man,  and  to  christian \nexperience, \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  435 \n\nthat  those  highest  virtues  of  the  best  of  men  are  sc- XXIL \n*  in  the  flesh ;'  that  is,  are  dead,  enemies  to  God,  ' \nnot  subject  to  the  law  of  God,  nor  capable  of \nbeing  subjected  to  it,  and  displeasing  to  God. \nFor  Paul  does  not  only  say  that  they  are \nnot  subjected,  but  that  neither  can  they  be  sub- \njected. So  Christ  also  in  Matthew  vii.  \"  A  cor- \nrupt tree  cannot  bring  forth  good  fruit.\"  And \nin  Matthew  xii.  \"  How  can  ye,  being  evil,  speak \ngood  things?\"  You  see  here,  that  we  not  only \nspeak  evil,  but  even  cannot  speak  good.  And  he \nwho  in  another  place  says,  that  we,  being  evil, \nknow  how  to  give  good  gifts  to  our  children,  still \ndenies  that  we  do  good  even  in  the  very  act  of \ngiving  good  things ;  inasmuch  as  the  creature  of \nGod  (which  we  give)  is  good;  but  neither  are \nwe  ourselves  good,  nor  do  we  give  our  good \nthings  well :  and  when  so  saying,  he  speaks  to  all ; \nyea,  even  to  his  disciples.  So  that  these  twin \nsentiments  of  Paul  stand  good :  \"  The  just  lives \nby  faith  ;>'  and  \"  Whatsoever  is  not  of  faith  is \nsin:\"  of  which  the  latter  flows  from  the  former. \nFor  if  there  is  nothing  but  faith  by  which  we  can \nbe  justified;  it  is  evident,  that  those  who  have  not \n\nthe  spiritual  man  {7rvevf.ia7iKo<s) — lie  who  has  a  7ri>evfia — that  is, \ne  an  Holy-Ghost-renewed  spirit' — lives  after  his  renewed  spirit, \nand  is  spiritual.  Thus  the  spirit  and  the  man,  and  the  flesh \nand  the  man,  are  distinct  substances  severally  5  though  the \none  includes  the  other. — Still,  Luther's  conclusion  is  not \naffected.  He  who  does  not  live  after  the  spirit,  but  after  the \nflesh,  does  only  evil ;  because  that  flesh,  after  which  he  lives \nis  only  evil ;  '  defecated'  evil :  and,  except  and  until  a  man  be \nrenewed  in  the  spirit  of  his  mind,  and  thus  be  made  spiritual, \nhe  neither  does,  nor  can  do  any  thing  good.  Nay  further,  if \nhe  be  thus  renewed,  and  when  he  hath  been  thus  renewed,  it \nis  only  so  far  as  his  renewred  spirit  be  impelled  and  sustained \nby  the  Holy  Ghost,  that  he  either  resisteth  evil,  or  worketh \ngood.  There  are  seasons,  wrhen,  for  the  fuller  manifestation \nof  God  unto  his  real  good,  the  Holy  Ghost,  who  never  leaves \nhis  temple,  is  but  as  the  friend  who  sitteth  by,  neither  speak- \ning, nor  putting  out  a  finger  to  help.  So  far  as  he  is  left  to \nthe  endeavour  and  power  of  Freewill,  therefore,  all  that  is  here \nsaid  by  Paul  about  not  pleasing  God,  &c.  belongs  to  him. \n\n2f2 \n\n\n436  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  faith  are  not  yet  justified.    Now  those  who  are  not \n\njustified  are  still  sinners;  and  sinners  are  corrupt \n\ntrees,  which  can  do  nothing  but  sin,  and  bear  cor- \nrupt fruit.  So  then,  Freewill  is  nothing  but  the \nservant  of  sin,  death  and  Satan :  which  neither \ndoeth,  nor  is  able  to  do  or  to  attempt,  any  thing \nbut  evil.v \nsc.xxm.

The  flesh — \nmeaning,  as  I  maintain,  the  natural,  unrenewed  substance  of \nman,  with  all  that  is  in  it  (and  the  unrenewed  man  has \nnothing  else) — is  enmity  against  God. — He  confirms  this  say- \ning by  two  of  Christ's,  which  say  we  can  do  nothing  else  j  not \nmerely  that  we  do  evil,  but  that  we  can  do  nothing  else,  from \nour  very  composition ;  being  like  e  corrupt  trees,'  \"being  evil.\" \nAnd  in  another  place:  '  Ye  \"being  evil,\"  do  evil,  even  whilst \nye  are  giving  good  gifts.' — Then,  by  insinuation  and  impli- \ncation, he  proves  the  same  from  Paul's  twin  sayings.  If  the \njust  man  lives  by  faith,  he  that  hath  not  faith  is  not  just; \nand,  if  not  just,  he  is  a  sinner. — If  whatsoever  be  not  of \nfaith  is  sin,  whatever  is  done  by  mere  Freewill  is  sin  ;  be- \ncause Freewill  has  nothing  to  do  with  faith,  but  is  by  the  suppo- \nsition perfectly  distinct  from  it :  neither  has  faith  any  thing  to  do \nwith  Freewill,  but  has  another  origin.  Whatsoever  it  doth  there- \nfore, not  being  of  faith,  is  sin.  So  that  Freewill  is  only  sin. — \nI  object  to  the  application  of  these  two  texts  in  this  connec- \ntion. It  is  the  eternal  state  of  the  already  justified  person,  which \nis  proclaimed  by  tf  shall  live.\"  (See  Habak.  ii.  4.  Galat.  hi.  11. \nHeb.  x.3S.)  Faith  then  is  the  acceptable  principle;  without  which \n(it  is  implied)  there  shall  be  no  acceptance  to  any  man.  Freewill \nhas  no  faith ;  therefore  does  nothing  acceptable. — But  still \nthe  fair  application  is,  shall  not  live;  not  does  only  sin. — \n'.'  Whatsoever  is  not  of  faith,  &c.\"  if  Luther  interprets  rightly y \nproves  his  point ;  because  Freewill,  not  acting  in  and  by  faith, \ncan  do  nothing,  therefore,  but  what  is  sin. — But  that  text  means, \nr-if  a  man  is  not  satisfied  as  to  the  rectitude  of  his  own  act,  but \ndoubts  about  it,'  it  is  sin. — This  text  therefore  does  not  fairly \napply ;  because  Freewill  may  have  no  doubts — yet  still  is \ndamned,  whether  she  doubt  or  not.  On  the  other  hand,  a \nperson  may  sin  in  some  particular  act,  by  acting  without \nfaith,  yet  not  be  a  condemned  person  :  it  is  of  such  that  Paul \nspeaks. — Thus,  although  the  principles  which  Luther  would \nestablish  from  these  two  texts  be  true  -f  these  texts,  rightly \nunderstood,  do  not  prove  them. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  437 \n\nwho  inquired  not  after  me.\"  He  says  these  things  sc.xxiii. \nabout  the  Gentiles ;  because  it  hath  been  given  to  \"\"\"; \nthem  to  know  and  hear  of  Christ,  when  they  could  Gentiles\"\" \nnot  even  think  of  him  before,  much  less  seek  after  called. \nhim,  or  prepare  themselves  for  him,  by  the  power \nof  Freewill.  It  is  abundantly  plain  from  this \nexample,  that  grace  comes  so  truly  gratuitously, \nthat  not  even  a  thought  about  it,  much  less  any \nthing  of  endeavour  or  pains  precedes  its  approach. \nThus  Paul  also,  when  he  was  Saul,  what  did  he \nby  that  most  exalted  degree  of  Freewill  which  he \npossessed  ?  Assuredly,  he  was  revolving  the  best \nand  most  honest  things  in  his  mind,  if  mere  rea- \nson be  inquired  of.  But  see  what  endeavour  it  is \nof  his,  by  which  he  finds  grace  :  he  is  not  seeking \nit;  nay,  it  is  even  by  raving  like  a  madman \nagainst  it,  that  he  receives  his  portion.  On  the \nother  hand,  speaking  of  the  Jews  in  the  ninth  chap- \nter, he  says  that  the  Gentiles  which  did  not  follow \nafter  righteousness  have  attained  to  righteousness, \neven  the  righteousness  which  is  of  faith ;  but  that \nIsrael  which  followed  after  the  law  of  righteous- \nness hath  not  attained  to  the  law  of  righteous- \nness. What  can  any  advocate  for  Freewill \nmutter  against  these  sayings?  The  Gentiles, \nwhen  filled  to  the  full  with  impiety  and  all  sorts \nof  vices,  receive  righteousness  freely  from  a  pity- \ning God.  The  Jews,  seeking  after  righteous- \nness with  the  greatest  pains  and  endeavours,  are \ndisappointed.  Is  not  this  just  to  say,  that  the \nendeavour  of  Freewill  is  vain,  whilst  endeavour- \ning after  the  best  things;  and  that  she  herself \nrather  makes  bad  worse,  stumbles  and  runs  back- \nwards No  one  can  say  that  they  have  not  tried \nhard,  with  the  utmost  power  of  Freewill.  Paul \nhimself  bears  them  this  testimony  in  his  tenth \nchapter,  \"  That  they  have  a  zeal  for  God,  but  not \n\nx  Sublapsum  referri.']  <  Omnia  rursus \n\nIn  pejus  mere,  ac  retro  sublapsa  referri.' \n\nVirg.

In  the  Gentiles  none \nof  those  excellencies  which  we  ascribe  to  Freewill \nare  present,  but  still  the  righteousness  of  God \nfollows.  What  is  this,  but  to  have  it  confirmed, \nas  well  by  the  most  manifest  example  of  both \nnations,  as  by  the  clearest  testimony  of  Paul  at \nthe  same  time,  that  (  grace  is  bestowed  freely \nupon  the  undeserving,  nay  upon  the  unworthiest \nof  human  beings ;  whilst  it  is  not  obtained  by \nany  pains,  endeavours,  or  performances,  great  or \nsmall,  even  of  the  best  and  most  respectable  of \nmen,  though  seeking  and  following  after  righte- \nousness with  a  burning  zeal/  * \n\nsc.xxiv.       Let  us  also  come  to  John,  who  is  of  himself  an \nabundant  and  able  devastator  of  Freewill.    In  the \n\ndevourer.  vei7  beginning  of  his  Gospel,  he  ascribes  such  a \nblindness  to  Freewill,  as  that  she  is  not  able  to \nsee  the  light  of  truth — so  far  is  she  from  having \npower  to  endeavour  after  it.  For  thus  speaks  he, \nCi  The  light  shineth  in  darkness,  but  the  darkness \ncomprehendeth  it  not.\"  And  presently :  u  He \nwas  in  the  world,  and  the  world  knew  him  not.  He \ncame  unto  his  own,  and  his  own  received  him  not.\" \nWhat  does  he  mean,  think  you,  by  the  world  ? \nWill  you  except  any  man  from  the  number \nincluded  under  this  name,  except  he  be  created \nanew  by  the  Holy  Ghost  ?  Indeed,  it  is  a  pecu- \nliar use2  which  this  Apostle  makes  of  the  word \n\ny  For  some  considerations  which  seem  desirable,,  to  mitigate \nthe  harshness  of  this  statement,  see  above,  Part  iv.

Paul  has  it  also,  Ephes.  ii.  1*2.  Coloss.  i.  6.  It  may \nbe  doubted  too,  whether  he  ever  speaks  of  the  world  uni- \nversally ;  that  is,  of  a  strict  c  all  men,'  {  all  mankind  / \nthough  his  contrast  is  varied.    Sometimes  it  is  the  world  at \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  439 \n\n'  world/  expressing  the  whole  race  of  man,  with-  sc.xxiv. \n\nout  exception,  by  it.     Whatever  he  says  about  mmm \n\nthe  worlds  therefore,  is  meant  concerning  Freewill, \nas  that  which  is  the  most  excellent  thing  in  man. \nNow  it  is  said  by  this  Apostle,  i  that  the  world \nknew  not  the  true  light.  The  world  hateth  Christ \nand  his  people.  The  world  knoweth  not,  neither \nseeth  the  Holy  Ghost.  The  whole  world  lieth  in \nwickedness ;  or  in  the  wicked  one.  All  that  is  in \nthe  world  is  the  lust  of  the  flesh,  the  lust  of  the \neyes,  and  the  pride  of  life.— Love  not  the  world/ \nAgain ;  \"  Ye  are  of  the  world,  saith  he.  The \nworld  cannot  hate  you;  but  me  it  hateth,  because \nI  testify  of  it  that  its  deeds  are  evil/*  All  these \nand  many  like  sayings,  then,  are  so  many  procla- \nmations about  Freewill ;  that  is,  about  the  prin- \ncipal constituent  part,  which  reigneth  in  the \nworld,  under  the  empire  of  Satan.  For  even  this \nJohn  speaks  of  the  world  in  a  way  of  opposition ; \nmeaning  by  it,  whatsoever  of  the  world  is  not \ntranslated  into  the  Spirit ; a  as  Christ  says  to  his \n\nlarge,  opposed  to  the  Jews  j  sometimes  the  multitude  of  the \nunregenerate,  opposed  to  the  called  people  of  God,  as  Luther \nafterwards  distinguishes  (\"  Nam  et  ipse  Johannes,  #c.\")  :  which \nis  a  more  correct  distinction  than  Christ's  people,  and  the \nseed  of  the  wicked  one.  For,  until  called  by  the  effectual \nworking  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  the  children  of  the  kingdom  are \noften  found  to  be  as  fierce  opponents  of  the  truth,  and  of  its \nchildren,  as  the  devil's  seed.  What  was  Paul  ? — Luther  does \nnot  notice  the  former  of  these  oppositions,  but  it  is  a  necessary \none  to  mark.  Clearly,  it  obtains  in  the  words  under  consi- \nderation. \"  He  was  in  the  world  (that  is,  in  the  material \nworld — on  the  earth)  and  the  world  knew  him  not :  he  came  unto \nhis  own,  &c.\"  The  contrast  here  is  between  the  world  at \nlarge,  and  his  peculiarly  connected  ones,  the  Jews.  And  so, \nin  John  iii.  <(  God  so  loved  the  world,  &c.\"  It  is  all  kindreds \nand  tongues,  and  languages,  &<\\  contrasted  with  the  natural \nseed  of  Abraham.  The  clear  sense  here  assists  in  establishing \nthis  use  of  the  term,  and  serves  to  confirm  the  ascription  of  it \nto  John  iii.  16,  &c. \n\na  Translation  in  spiritum.']  We  might  render  ''made  spiritual  ;■ \nbut  this  would  efface  the  distinction  which  he  means  to  mark. \nHe  opposes  Christ  to  the  world  5  making  Christ  the  Spirit,  in \ncontrast  with  Adam,  the  flesh.  So,  by  realized  union  with \nChrist,  we  are  transferred  from  the  world  into  the  Spirit, \n\n\n440  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n•PARTV.  Apostles,,  \"  I  have  taken  you  out  of  the  world, \n■\"\"  '  and  have  constituted  you,  &c.\"  If  now  there \nwere  any  in  the  world,  who  strove  for  good  by \nthe  power  of  Freewill — as  must  be  the  case  if \nFreewill  could  really  do  any  thing — John  ought \nproperly  to  have  moderated  his  expression  out  of \nrespect  to  these,  that  he  might  not  involve  them \nby  a  general  expression  in  the  multitude  of \ncrimes,  of  which  he  accuses  the  world.  From  his \nnot  doing  so,  it  is  evident  that  he  charges  Free- \nwill with  all  the  crimes  with  which  he  charges  the \nworld ;  since  whatever  the  world  does,  it  does  by \nthe  power  of  Freewill;  that  is,  by  the  under- \nstanding and  the  will,  the  most  excellent  of  its \nconstituent  parts.     It  follows  : \n\n\"  But  as  many  as  received  him,  to  them  gave \nhe  power  to  become  the  sons  of  God;  even  to \nthem  which  believe  in  his  name :  which  were \nborn  not  of  bloods,  nor  of  the  will  of  the  flesh, \nnor  of  the  will  of  man,  but  of  God/5 \n\nHaving  made  this  division,  he  rejects  from \nthe  kingdom  of  Christ  e  bloods/  6  the  will  of \nthe  flesh/  and  c  the  will  of  man/  By  '  bloods' \nI  suppose  him  to  mean  the  Jews ;  that  is,  those \nwho  had  a  mind  to  be  sons  of  the  kingdom,  be- \ncause they  were  sons  of  Abraham  and  of  the \nFathers ;  boasting  forsooth  of  their  descent. — \nBy  '  the  will  of  the  flesh'  I  understand  the  pains \nwith  which  that  people  exercised  themselves  in \nlaw  works.  For  the  flesh,  here,  signifies  carnal \npersons  which  have  not  the  Spirit ;  as  being  those \nwho  have  will  and  endeavour,  but,  since  there  is \nno  Ho]y  Ghost  in  this  will  and  endeavour,  have \nthem  carnally.  By  i  the  will  of  man,'  I  under- \nstand the  pains  which  mankind  in  general,  all \nmen  take — whether  under  the  law,  or  without  the \nlaw — the  Gentiles,  say,  or  whom  you  will — to \nfind  favour  with  God.  The  meaning  therefore  is, \nneither  by  a  birth  of  the  flesh,  nor  by  a  zeal  for  the \nlaw,  nor  by  any  other  human  means,  are  they  made \nsons  of  God,  but  only  by  a  divine  birth.     If  then \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  441 \n\nthey  are  not  born  of  the  flesh,  nor  trained  by  the  SC.xxiV- \n\nlaw,  nor  obtained  by  any  human  discipline,  but \n\nare  born  again  of  God ;  it  is  plain  that  Freewill  is \n\nof  no  avail  -here.     For  I  think  the  word  '  man/ \n\nhere,  is  taken,  in  the  Hebrew  acceptation,  for  any \n\none  whatsoever;  just  as  'flesh'  is  taken,  by  contrast, \n\nfor  the  people  of  Israel  not  having  the  Spirit : \n\nand  c  will/  again,  for  the  highest  power  in  man ; \n\nthat  is,  the  principal  ingredient  in  Freewill. \n\nBut  grant  that  we  may  not  understand  each \nword  correctly,  still  the  sum  and  substance  of \nthe  assertion  is  most  plain ;  namely,  that  John, \nby  this  division,  rejects  whatsoever  is  not  of \ndivine  begetting,  in  saying  that  men  are  not  made \nthe  sons  of  God  but  by  being  born  of  God; \nwhich  is  effected,  according  to  his  own  inter- \npretation, by  believing  in  his  name.  Now  in  this \nrejection,  the  will  of  man,  or  Freewill,  not  being \na  thing  born  of  God,  nor  yet  faith,  is  necessarily \nincluded.  If  Freewill  availed  any  thing,  the  will \nof  man  ought  not  to  be  rejected  by  John  ;  neither \nought  men  to  be  withdrawn  from  it,  and  sent  to \nfaith  and  new  birth  only  :  else  that  might  be  said \nto  him,  which  was  said  in  Isaiah  v.  \"  Woe  unto \nyou  who  call  good  evil.\"  But  now,  since  he \nequally  rejects  'bloods/  'the  will  of  the  flesh/  and \n6  the  will  of  man/  it  is  certain,  that  the  will  of  man \nhas  no  more  power  towards  making  sons  of  God, \nthan  bloods  or  fleshly  nativity.  Now,  no  one \ncounts  it  doubtful  whether  fleshly  birth  makes,  or \ndoth  not  make,  sons  of  God ;  as  Paul  also  tells  us \nin  Romans  ix.  \"They  which  are  the  children  of \nthe  flesh,  these  are  not  the  children  of  God :\" \nwhich  he  proves  by  the  examples  of  Ishmael  and \nEsau,b \n\nb  '  The  will  of  the  flesh'  and  '  the  will  of  man'  separated  and \ndistinguished,  and  both  named,  must,  upon  every  conceivable \ninterpretation  of  those  terms,  exclude  every  thing  belonging  to \nthe  human  will  from  this  generative  power ;  and  therefore \ndecide  the  question  as  to  the  power  of  Freewill,  in  bringing  us \n\n\n442 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\n\nsc.  xxv. \n\nJohn  Bap- \ntist's testi- \nmony. \n\n\npart  v.       The  same  John  introduces  the  Baptist  speaking \n—  thus  ;  cc  Of  whose  fulness  have  all  we  received, \ngrace  for  grace.\" \n\nHe  speaks  of  grace  received  by  us  out  of  the \nfulness  of  Christ ;  but  for  the  sake  of  what  merit, \nor  endeavour?  For  the  grace,  says  he,  forsooth \nof  Christ  :c  just  as  Paul  also  speaks  in  Romans  v. \n\"  The  grace  of  God,  and  the  gift  by  grace  of  one \nman  Jesus  Christ,  hath  abounded  unto  many.\" \nWhere  now   is   the    endeavour  of  Freewill,  by \n\nto  the  inheritance  of  God's  children.  But  I  should  rather \nunderstand  s  bloods'  to  express  natural  birth  generally  (we \nhave  not  it  by  descent  from  our  parents)  ;  c  will  of  the  flesh' \nfor  our  own  personal  and  individual  will,  which  we  have  by  na- \nture 3  and  '  will  of  man'  for  the  ordinance  and  appointment  of \nman  generally :  it  is  not  a  human  device  j  what  men  have  chosen \nand  procured  for  themselves,  or  what  can,  in  any  individual \ninstance,  be  conferred  by  man,  one  or  many,  willing  it  to  ano- \nther. A  man  may  leave  his  estate  at  death,  or  confer  a  liberal \ngift  in  his  lifetime,  but  he  cannot  will  or  bestow  new  birth. — \nLuther  speaks  as  if  we  were  e  begotten'  by  believing  (f  nascendo \nex  Deo,  quod  fit  credendo  in  nomine  ejus')  ;  like  Erasmus's \nc  renatus  per  fidem,'  which,  as  we  saw,  he  does  not  object  to  : \nbut  the  truth  is,  we  must  be  begotten  again  before  we  can \nbelieve  j  and  then,  believing,  we  take  our  place  amongst  God's \nadopted  children.  So  that  there  is  a  sense  in  which  we  are  rege- \nnerated by  faith,  inasmuch  as  it  is  by  faith  we  are  manifested  to  be \nof  the  Lord's  children  :  but  the  birth,  or  generation  more  pro- \nperly, spoken  of  in  verse  13.  is  prior  to  faith  j  so  that  it  can- \nnot in  this  view  be  said,  c  nascor  ex  Deo,  credendo  in  nomine \nJesu  Christi.'  (See  above,  Part  iv.  Sect.  xlv.  note  *j  also \nPart  v.  Sect.  xix.  note  n.) \n\nc  pr0  gratid  scilicet  Christi.']  Luther  seems  to  understand \nhim  as  saying  e grace  in  return  for,  or  on  account  of,  his  grace  \\ \nthat  is,  the  grace  which  Christ  has  himself  shewn.  So  he  clearly \nexplains  himself  afterwards,  when  he  says  f  gratiam  eis  impetrat \nper  suum  sanguinem.'  In  this  view,  it  is  parallel  with  the  pas- \nsage which  he  cites  from  Romans  v. — It  is  more  commonly \ninterpreted  '  grace  for  grace  ;'  that  is,  one  degree  or  measure  of \ngrace  for  another.  But  Luther  is  the  more  correct :  although \nthe  grace  which  we  have  from  Christ  is  in  reality  grace  given \nto  us  by  the  Father  in  the  same  instant  in  which  the  grace  is \ngiven  to  Christ,  by  means  of  which  he  has  done  and  endured \nevery  thing  personally ;  still  it  comes  to  us,  and  is  actually \nconferred  upon  us,  in  the  way  of  fruit  and  consequence  of  his \nactings — grace  bestowed  on  us;  for  the  sake  of  grace  acted \npreviously  by  himself. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  443 \n\nwhich  grace  is  procured  ?  Here  John  says,  not  sc.  xxv. \nonly  that  grace  is  received  without  any  endea- \nvour  of  ours,  but  even  by  another's  grace,  or \nanother's  merit ;  namely,  that  of  one  man,  Jesus \nChrist.  Either  therefore  it  is  false,  that  we \nreceive  our  grace  for  the  sake  of  another's  grace  5 \nor  it  is  evident  that  Freewill  is  nothing;  for  the \ntwo  cannot  stand  together — that  the  grace  of  God \nis  on  the  one  hand  so  cheap,  as  to  be  obtained \ncommonly,  and  every  where,  by  the  paltry  endea- \nvour of  any  man  you  please ;  and  on  the  other  so \ndear,  as  to  be  freely  bestowed  upon  us  for  and \nby  the  grace  of  one  so  great  a  man  only. \n\nI  would  at  the  same  time  admonish  the  advo- \ncates of  Freewill  in  this  place,  that  in  asserting \nFreewill  they  are  deniers  of  Christ.  For,  if  I  obtain \nthe  grace  of  God  through  my  own  endeavour,  what \nneed  is  there  of  the  grace  of  Christ  for  my  receiving \nof  grace  ?  or,  what  is  wanting  to  me,  when  I  have \nobtained  the  grace  of  God?  But  Diatribe  has \nsaid,  all  the  Sophists  also  say,  that  we  obtain  the \ngrace  of  God  by  our  own  endeavour,  and  are \nprepared  for  the  reception  of  it,  not  of  condig- \nnity  indeed,  but  of  congruity :  which  is  abso- \nlutely denying  Christ,  for  whose  grace's  sake \nthe  Baptist  here  testifies  that  we  receive \ngrace.  For,  as  to  that  figment  about  condig- \nnity  and  congruity,  I  have  already  confuted  it; \nshewing  that  these  are  empty  words  which  in \nreality  mean  merit  of  condignity/  and  have  more \nimpiety  in  them  than  the  Pelagian  assertions;  as \nI  have  declared.  So  that  the  impious  Sophists, \nwith  Diatribe  at  their  head,  deny  the  Lord  Christ \nwho  bought  us,  more  than  the  Pelagians,  or  any \nheretics  have  done :  so  utterly  incompatible  is \ngrace  with  any  particle  or  power  of  Free- \nwill.— Howbeit,  that  the  advocates  for  Freewill \n\nd  Meritum  condignum.\"]  c  Worthy  merit/  i.  e.  '  merit  worthy \nof  the  reward  which  is  proposed  to  be  given  to  it  5 '  '  merit  of \nworth  to  the  uttermost. '. — See  above,  Sect.  xvi. \n\n\n444  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.   deny  Christ,  is  proved  not  only  by  this  Scrip- \n'  '  tore  but  by   their   own  life.     Hence  it  is,  that \n\nthey  make  Christ  to  be  no  longer  a  sweet \nMediator,  but  a  tremendous  Judge;  whom  they \nare  endeavouring  to  appease  by  the  intercessions \nof  his  Virgin  Mother,  and  of  the  Saints ;  more- \nover by  many  works,  rites,  superstitions,  vows  of \ntheir  own  invention :  the  object  of  all  which  is  to \nmake  Christ  favourable  to  them,  that  he  may  give \nthem  his  grace.  On  the  other  hand,  they  do  not \nbelieve  that  he  intercedes  with  God,  and  obtains \ngrace  for  them  through  his  blood;  and  grace,  as \nit  is  here  said,  for  grace.  And  as  they  believe, \nso  it  is  done  unto  them.  They  have  Christ  truly \nand  deservedly  for  their  inexorable  Judge; \nwhilst  they  forsake  him  in  his  office  of  most  pow- \nerful Mediator  and  Saviour,  and  account  his  blood \nand  grace  a  more  worthless  thing  than  the  pains \nand  endeavours  of  Freewill, \nsaxxvi.  Let  us  a]so  ]iear  an  example  of  Freewill.  Nico- \n~  demus,  I  warrant  you,  is  a  man  in  whom  nothing \n\nmus°s case.  was  wanting  which  Freewill  can  effect:  what  is \nit  of  pains  or  endeavour,  which  this  man  omits  ? \nHe  confesses  Christ  to  be  a  true  witness, \nand  to  have  come  from  God;  he  makes  mention \nof  his  miracles,  he  comes  by  night  to  hear  and  to \ncompare  the  rest.  Does  not  this  man  seem  to \nhave  sought  the  things  which  belong  to  piety  and \nsalvation,  by  the  power  of  Freewill?  But  see \nhow  he  founders  !  When  he  hears  the  true  way \nof  salvation  by  new  birth  pointed  out  to  him  by \nChrist,  does  he  recognise  that  way,  or  confess \nthat  he  has  ever  sought  it?  Nay,  he  so  revolts \nfrom  it,  and  is  confounded,  that  he  not  only  says \nhe  does  not  understand  it,  but  even  turns  away \nfrom  it,  as  impossible. — How  can  these  things \nbe,  says  he?  And  no  wonder  indeed:  for  who \never  heard  that  a  man  must  be  born  again  of \nwater  and  of  the  Spirit,  if  he  would  be  saved  ? \nWho  ever  thought  that  the   Son  of  God  must \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  445 \n\nbe  lifted  up,  to  the  end  that  all  that  believe  in  him  sect. \nmight  not  perish,  but  have  eternal  life.  Have  the  XXVL \nacutest  and  best  of  philosophers  ever  made \nmention  of  this  ?  Have  the  princes  of  this  world \never  learned  this  science  ?  Has  any  man's  Free- \nwill ever  made  an  attempt  at  it?  Does  not  Paul \nconfess  it  to  be  wisdom  hidden  in  a  mystery  ? \nforetold,  it  is  true,  by  the  Prophets,  but  revealed \nby  the  Gospel;  so  as  to  have  been  from  eternity \nkept  secret  and  unknown  to  the  world.6 \n\nWhat  shall  I  say  ?  Shall  we  consult  experience  ? \nEven  the  whole  world,  even  human  reason,  even \nFreewill  herself  is  compelled  to  acknowledge,  that \nshe  neither  knew  nor  heard  of  Christ,  before  the \nGospel  came  into  the  world.  Now,  if  she  did  not \nknow,  much  less  hath  she  sought,  or  been  able  to \nseek,  or  to  endeavour  after  him.  But  Christ  is \nthe  way,  the  truth,  the  life  and  the  salvation.  She \nconfesses  therefore,  whether  she  would  or  no, \nthat  by  her  own  powers  she  has  neither  known, \nnor  been  able  to  seek  those  things,  which  are \nbelonging  to  the  way,  the  truth  and  the  salvation. \nStill  however,  in  opposition  to  this  very  confession \nand  our  own  experience,  we  play  the  madman; \nand  maintain,  by  a  mere  war  of  words,  that  we \nhave  a  certain  power  remaining  in  us,  which  both \nknows  and  can  apply  itself  to  the  things  that  ap- \npertain to  salvation:  which  is  as  good  as  saying, \nknows  and  can  apply  itself  to  Christ  the  Son  of  God, \n\n\ne  It  is  most  true,  that  the  Gospel  mystery  is  strictly  matter \nof  revelation,  and  not  within  the  discovery  of  natural  reason. \nBut  it  is  also  true,  that  it  has  been  the  will  of  God  there  should \nbe  intimations,  of  this  mystery,  hereafter  to  be  revealed,  and \ntraces  of  such,  intimations  amidst  all  nations,  from  the  begin- \nning. The  kingdom  of  God  was  announced  immediately  after \nthe  fall,  in  the  denunciation  upon  the  serpent ;  and  it  has  been \npart  of  the  counsel  and  work  of  God,  that  it  should  be  spoken \nof,  and  looked  for,  and  that  the  eternal  separation  between  the \ntwo  parts  of  the  human  race  into  hell  and  into  heaven,  should  be \nmade  on  the  ground  of  it. — Still,  it  is  not  that  Freewill  has \nfound  this  out— but  God  has  shewn  it. \n\n\n446 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

For,  if \nwhat  is  said  about  Christ  and  his  grace  were  not \nall  said  by  way  of  comparison,  in  opposition  to \ntheir  contraries;  as  for  example,  that  out  of  Christ \nthere  is  none  but  the  devil ;  out  of  grace,  there  is \nnothing  but  wrath ;  out  of  light,  there  is  nothin \n\n\nbut   darkness  :  out  of  the \n\n\nway \n\n\nther \n\n\ne  is \n\n\nnothing \n\n\nbut  error ;  out  of  the  truth,  there  is  nothing  but \n\nf  Pro  nobis  exaltatum.~\\  Exalt,  is  a  word  of  doubtful  meaning-, \nwhich  might  refer  to  his  seat  at  the  Father's  right  hand ;  but  I \nunderstand  it  with  allusion  to  the  Lord's  words,,  \"And  I  if  I \nbe  lifted  up  \"  (vyjs&Gw,  John  xii.  32.),  as  explained  by  the \ncomment,  <e  this  he  said,  signifying  what  death  he  should  die.\" \n\ns  Nee  sic  tamen  tacere.\"]  A  sort  of  ogvfiivpov,  like  c  stremna \ninertia,'  '  concordia  discors  j'  but  there  is  no  real  inconsist- \nency -.

And \nthus,  in  establishing  Freewill,  you  make   Christ \nvoid,  and  tread  all  Scripture  under  foot.     Again  ; \nwhilst  you  pretend   in   words   to   be   confessing \nChrist,  you  really  and  with  your  heart  deny  him  : \nfor,  if  Freewill  is  not  all  error  and  damnation,  but \nsees  and  wills  things  honest  and  good,  and  things \nwhich  pertain  to  salvation,  she  is  whole,  and  has \nno  need  of  Christ  for  her  doctor  ;  nor  hath  Christ \nredeemed  that  part  of  our  nature  :  for  what  need  is \nthere  of  light  and  life,  where  there  is  light  and  life? \nNow,  if  this  be  not  redeemed  by  Christ,  the  best \ningredient    in   the    composition   of   man    is   not \nredeemed ;  but  is  of  itself  good  and  sound.     In \nthis  case,  God,  also,  is  unjust  in  condemning  any \nman,  because  he  condemns  that  which  is  best  in \n\nb  The  word  extra  is  used  throughout  the  whole  of  this  pas- \nsage, to  denote  distinctness  :  there  are  but  two  sorts  of  sub* \nstances  j  to  be  without  the  one,  is  to  be  within  the  other. \n\n\n448  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npartv.  man,  and  which  is  sound;  in   other    words,   he \ncondemns  the  innocent.     For  there  is  no  man  who \nhas  not  Freewill :  and,  though  a  bad  man  abuses \nhis  Freewill,  still  we  are  taught  that  the  power  itself \nis  not  extinguished  in  him,  so  as  neither  to  strive, \nnor  be  able  to  strive,  for  good.  Now  if  it  be  such, \nwithout  doubt  it  is  holy,  just  and  good,  and  there- \nfore ought  not  to  be  condemned,  but  to  be  sepa- \nrated from  the  man  that  is  to  be  condemned.  But \nthis  cannot  be ;  and  if  it  could  be,  in  that  case  the \nman,  no  longer  having  Freewill,  would  no  longer \nbe  a  man,  and  would  neither  merit  evil  nor  good, \nneither  be  damned  nor  saved,  but  must  be  an \nabsolute  brute,  and  no  longer  an  immortal  being. \nIt  remains  therefore,  that  God  is  unjust  who  con- \ndemns that  holy,  just  and  good  power,  which  has \nno  need  of  Christ,  in  and  with  a  bad  man.1 \nsect.

If  you  deny  that  Scripture  speaks  by  compa- \nrison, 1.  You  make  Scripture  void.  2.  You  deny  Christ. \n3.  You  make  God  unjust. — His  reasoning  is  subtile,  but  con- \nclusive.— See  the  same  sort  of  argument  pursued,  and  re- \nmarked upon,  Part  iv.

The  secret  is, \na  regenerated  soul,  when  Christ  is  preached,  knows,  owns  and \nreceives  him  :  he  who  rejects  Christ,  thereby  proves  that  he  is \nnot  regenerated,  but  is  in  his  nature  state  ;  devilish,  and  pos- \nsessed by  the  devil. — It  is  supposed,  that  the  state  here  described \nis  the  abiding,  unchanged,  yea  dying  state  of  the  man.  Every \ndeliberate  rejection  of  Christ,  when  preached,  gives  ground  of \nawful  apprehension  ;  but  it  is  final  rejection,  which  stamps  this \njudgment.  Such  being  his  mind  towards  Christ,  he  needs  not \nthe  process  of  the  last  judgment  to  declare  whether  he  be  \"  in \nGod/'  or  not, \n\n\nFUEEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  449 \n\nTell  me,  whether  Freewill  is  in  the  number  of  sect.- \nthe  believers,  or  no  ?  If  she  be,  again  she  has  no  xxvm- \nneed  of  grace,  seeing  she  believes  in  Christ  of  \" \nherself,  which  Christ,  however,  she  of  herself  nei- \nther knows,  nor  has  any  conception  of.  If  she \nbe  not,  she  has  been  judged  already :  and  what  is \nthis,  but  that  she  hath  been  condemned  before \nGod  ?  Now  God  condemns  nothing  but  what  is \nwicked.  She  is  wicked  therefore  :  and  what  pious \nact  can  an  impious  thing  attempt  ?  Nor  can  Free- \nwill, I  suppose,  be  excepted  here ;  since  he  speaks \nof  the  whole  man,  which  he  says  is  condemned. \nBesides,  unbelief  is  not  a  gross  affection,  but  that \nhighest  sort  of  affection  which  sitteth  and  reign eth \nin  the  citadel  of  the  will  and  understanding;  just \nas  its  contrary,  faith,  does.  Now  to  be  unbe- \nlieving, is  to  deny  God  and  make  him  a  liar. \n(1  Johni.  10.)  If  we  believe  not,  we  make  God  a \nliar.1  Now,  how  can  that  power  which  is  contrary \nto  God,  and  which  makes  him  a  liar,  strive  after \ngood?  If  this  power  were  not  unbelieving  and \nungodly,  he  ought  not  to  have  said  of  the  whole \nman,  \"  he  hath  been  judged  already,\"  but  to  have \nspoken  thus  :  'the  man  hath  been  judged  already \nwith  respect  to  his  gross  affections ;  but  with \nrespect  to  his  best  and  most  excellent  one,  he  is \nnot  judged,  because  it  strives  after  faith,  or  rather \nis  even  now  believing/ \n\nThus,  as  often  as  the  Scripture  says,  cc  Every \nman  is  a  liar,\"  we  shall  say  upon  the  authority  of \nFreewill,  '  On  the  contrary,  the  Scripture  rather \nlies,  because  man  is  not  a  liar  in  his  best  part, \nthat  is,  in  his  understanding  and  will,  but  only  in \nhis  flesh,  blood  and  marrow;  so  that  all  from \nwhence  man  has  his  name — that  is,  understanding \nand  will — is  sound  and  holy/     So,  in  that  saying \n\n1  Luther  refers  only  to  1  John  i.  But  the  testimony  is \nequally  strong  1  John  v.  10.  \",  He  that  believeth  not  God  hath \nmade  him  a  liar ;  because  he  believeth  not  the  record  that  God \ngave  of  his  Son.\" \n\n2   G \n\n\n450  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npartv.  of  the  Baptist's,  «  He  that  believeth  on  the  Son, \n'     '  hath  everlasting  life :  but  he  that  believeth  not \n\nthe  Son,  shall  not  see  life,  but  the  wrath  of  God \nabideth  on  him ;\"  by  K  upon  him '  we  must  under- \nstand, '  upon  his  gross  affections  the  wrath  of  God \nremaineth ;'  but  upon  that  eminent  power  of  Free- \nwill— upon  his  understanding  and  will  forsooth — \ngrace  and  eternal  life  abideth.  It  appears  from \nthis  example,  that,  in  order  to  maintain  Freewill, \nyou,  by  a  synecdoche,\"1  turn  and  twist  what  is  said  in \nthe  Scriptures  against  ungodly  men  so  as  to  con- \nfine it  to  the  brutish  part  of  man  ;  hereby  keeping \nthe  rational  and  truly  human  part  of  him  safe  and \nsound.  In  this  case,  I  will  render  my  thanks  to \nthe  assertors  of  Freewill ;  since  I  shall  not  feel  the \nleast  concern  for  my  sin,  being  confident  that  my \nunderstanding  and  will,  that  is,  my  Freewill, \ncannot  be  condemned,  inasmuch  as  it  is  never \nextinguished,  but  always  remains  sound,  just  and \nholy.  But  if  my  understanding  and  will  are  to  be \nhappy,  I  shall  rejoice  that  my  filthy  and  brutish \nflesh  is  separated  and  condemned  5  so  far  am  I \nfrom  wishing  that  Christ  should  be  its  redeemer. \nYou  see  whither  the  dogma  of  Freewill  carries  us, \neven  to  the  denying  of  all  divine  and  human,  tem- \nporal and  eternal  realities,  and  to  the  deluding  of \nitself  with  so  many  monstrous  fictions  ! \nJohniii.  So   again,    the   Baptist   says,  \"a  man  cannot \n\n27,  receive  any  thing  except  it  shall  have  been  given \n\nhim  from  heaven.\" \n\nCease,  Diatribe,  to  display  your  great  fluency \nhere,  by  enumerating  all  the  things  which  we \nreceive  from  heaven !  We  are  not  arguing  about \nnature,  but  about  grace;  we  are  not  inquiring \nwhat  sort  of  persons  we  are  upon  earth,  but  what \nin  heaven  and  before  God.  We  know  that  man \nis  constituted  lord  of  the  things  beneath   him ; \n\n1X1  Per  synecdochen.\"\\  Syn.  '  A  figure  by  which  part  is  taken \nfor  the  whole,  or  the  whole  for  part .-'  here,  Diatribe  makes  it \nthe  whole  of  man  put  for  his  grosser  part. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  451 \n\nover  which  he  has  power  and  Freewill,  that  they  sect. \nmay  obey  him,  and  may  do  what  he  wills  and \nthinks.  But  this  is  our  question,  whether  he  has \nFreewill  towards  God,  so  that  God  obeys  and \ndoes  what  man  wills ;  or,  whether  God,  rather,  has \nFreewill  over  man,  so  that  he  wills  and  does  what \nGod  willsfcand  can  do  nothing  but  what  God  shall \nhave  willed  and  done.  Here  the  Baptist  says, \nthat  he  can  receive  nothing,  except  it  be  given  him \nfrom  heaven  :  so  that  Freewill  is  nothing.11 \n\nSo  again,  \"  He  that  is  of  the  earth  is  earthly,  John  m. \nand  speaketh  of  the  earth ;  he  that  cotneth  from  31* \nheaven  is  above  all.\" \n\nHere  again  he  makes  all  earthly  (and  says  that \nthey  mind  and  speak  earthly  things)  who  are  not \nof  Christ,  and  leaves  none  between  the  two.  But \nFreewill,  surely,  is  not  he  that  cometh  from  heaven. \nSo  that  it  must  be  of  the  earth,  and  must  mind \nand  speak  the  things  of  the  earth.     Now,  if  there \n\nn  Hie  dicit.'}  That  is,  according  to  Luther  (who  assumes \nthat  the  things  here  spoken  of  are  things  of  God,  not  of  the \ncreature),  determines  this  question ;  it  is  God's  will,  not  man's, \nthat  is  done. — I  have  already  objected  many  times  to  the  dis- \ntinction which  Luther  here  again  resorts  to  (see  above,  Part  iv. \nSect.  xlvi.  note  x) ;  nor  can  I  allow  this  text  to  be  a  direct  tes- \ntimony against  Freewill. — John  is  accounting  for  the  superior \nhonour  paid  to  Jesus  above  himself:  he  had  just  been  informed \nconcerning  Jesus,  \"  All  men  come  to  Him.\"  The  principle  of \nthe  remark  therefore  is,  I  can  have  no  more  of  honour  than  it \nis  the  will  of  God  to  bestow  upon  me.  And  he  goes  on  to  say, \nthat  he  never  claimed  to  be  Christ,  and  consequently  never \nclaimed  to  receive  the  honour  which  it  had  been  the  Father's \ngood  pleasure  to  appropriate  to  Him.  It  is  honour  and  dis- \ntinction therefore,  not  spiritual  power  and  capacity,  of  which. \nJohn  here  speaks. — But  it  is  honour  in  and  of  the  kingdom  of \nGod  5  which  is  preceded  by  a  gift  of  super-creation  power \nexciting  and  leading  to  it.  As  the  honour,  so  the  precedent \npower  is  of  God,  and  according  to  the  measure  in  which  he \nhas  ordained  to  bestow,  and  does  produce  it. — However,  non \ntali  auxilio.  If  Luther  understands  it,  '  we  must  have  power \ngiven  to  enable  us  to  receive  power,'  it  is  a  testimony :  but \nits  meaning  is  far  simpler  than  this.  What  we  have,  we \nhave  received :  if  another  has  more,  it  is  because  God  has \ngiven  it. \n\n2  g  2 \n\n\n452  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  were  any  power  in  any  man,  which  at  any  time, \n\n'  in  any  place,  in  any  work,  did  not  mind  earthly \n\nthings,  the  Baptist  ought  to  have  excepted  this \nman,  and  not  to  have  said  generally  concerning \nall  out  of  Christ,  that  they  are  earthly,  and  speak \nof  the  earth.0 \nJohnviii.

Did  not  the  whole  world  know  this  before? \nBesides,  what  need  is  there  to  say  that  men  are \nof  the   world    in    that   part   in   which   they   are \n\n°  This  is  a  testimony  borne  to  Jesus  by  John,  in  contrast \nwith  himself :  though  filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost  even  from  his \nmother's  womb,  and  having  the  hand  of  the  Lord  with  him \n(Luke  i.  15.  66.),  he  had  not  been  born  'by  the  Holy  Ghost's \ncoming  upon  a  virgin  mother,  and  the  power  of  the  Highest's \novershadowing  her  ;'  '  he  had  not  come  down  from  heaven  ;' \nhe  had  not  *  come  from  above,'  '  come  from  heaven,'  (and,  as \ncompared  with  Him,  was  earthly  in  his  words  (see  Luke  i.  35. \nJohn  iii.  13.  31.  vi.  38.  41,  42.*),  as  well  as  in  his  frame  and \nformation.)  Luther  misunderstands  the  text — does  not  see  its \nglory,  and  does  not  elicit  its  testimony  against  Freewill  cor- \nrectly. It  Sis  however  a  testimony  :  if  John  only  so  far  as  he \nhad  a  gift  from  heaven  was  other  than  earthly,  and  had  com- \nparatively so  little  of  this  gift  as  fitly  to  call  himself  earthly — \nwhat  is  'Freewill,'  'nature  man,'  'that  which  is  nothing  but \nearth,'  instead  of  being  such  an  one  as  John  by  the  grace  of \nGod  had  been  made.  It  is  not  '  Christ's  people,'  and  '  the \nworld,'  which  are  opposed  to  each  other  here  by  the  names \n'earthly '  and  'heavenly  •'  but  Christ  and  John  singly:  John \nwas  a  man  in  nowise  different  from  other  men  as  to  his  natural \nframe,  he  was  truly  and  solely  a  son  of  Adam :  but  Christ's \nhuman  person,  as  to  its  spiritual  part,  was  from  heaven. \n\n*  I  do  not  refer  to  1  Cor.  xv.  47.  because  I  consider  it  as  belonging  to \nanother  subject — Christ  the  risen  head  of  his  risen  people,  come  down  the \nsecond  time  from  heaven  to  raise  his  dead  ones  : — it  is  of  Christ  as  walking \nupon  this  earth  that  the  Baptist  here  testifies,  he  comet h  or  (what  is  the  same \nin  import  here)  hath  come  from  heaven ;  and  so  in  the  other  passages  to \nwhich  I  have  referred. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  453 \n\nbrutish ;  when,  at  this  rate,   the  beasts  also   are     sect. \nof  the  world  ?p  XXIX' \n\n\nAgain,  what  does  that  saying  of  Christ's  in  j0hnvj. \nJohn  vi.  \"  No  one  cometh  unto  me,  except  my  44. \nFather  shall  have  drawn  him'/5  leave  to  Freewill? q \nHe  says,  it  is  necessary  that  a  man  hear  and  learn \nfrom  the  Father  himself;  and  afterwards,  that  all \nmust  be  taught  of  God.  (vv.  44,  45.)  Here  for- \nsooth he  teaches  that  not  only  the  works  and  pains \nof  Freewill  are  vain,  but  that  even  the  word  of \nthe  Gospel  (of  which  he  is  here  treating)  is  heard \nin  vain,  except  the  Father  himself  speak,  teach, \nand  draw  within.  No  man  can  come,  says  he  : \nthat  power  forsooth,  by  which  a  man  is  enabled  to \nmake  any  endeavour  after  Christ;  that  is,  after \nthose  things  which  are  appertinent  to  salvation ; \nis  asserted  to  be  nothing.  Nor  is  that  saying  of \nAugustine's  which  Diatribe  adduces  for  the  pur- \npose of  blurring  this  most  clear  and  most  mighty \npassage — that  God  draweth  just  as  we  draw  a \nsheep  by  shewing  it  a  bough — of  any  service  to \nFreewill.  She  will  have  it,  that  this  simile  proves \nthere  is  a  power  in  us  to  follow  the  drawing  of \nGod.  But  this  simile  is  of  no  avail  here  :  foras- \nmuch as  God  shews  us  not  one  good  thing  only, \nbut  all  his  good  things,  and  even  Christ  himself — \n\np  Surely  the  Lord  means  more  by  '  from  beneath'  here,  than \nthe  Baptist  did  ;  who  spake  of  himself — or,  according  to \nLuther,  e  of  himself  and  all  that  are  Christ's.'  The  Lord \nspeaks  of  these  Jews  as  the  devil's  seed,  whose  throne  and \nhabitation  are  beneath  the  earth  :  whilst  his  own  origin,  as  well \nas  throne,  was  and  is  heaven.  (See  that  whole  discourse \nJohn  viii.  especially  from  v.  21  to  the  end  of  the  chapter.) — \nLuther's  conclusion  however  is  correct.  He  bore  this  testi- \nmony to  their  best  and  finer  part,  not  to  the  grosser.  An \nobjection  may  indeed  be  taken  '  These  were  expressly  and \nemphatically  children  of  the  wicked  one  -,  and  therefore  their \ncase  is  somewhat  different  from  that  of  the  children  of  the \nkingdom.  The  answer  is,  not  as  it  respects  nature — Freewill \nand  all  nature  powers. \n\n°  Venit  ad  me.~\\  The  original  text  is  stronger  ;  \"  is  able  to \ncome  unto  me.\" \n\n\n454  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  his  Son  ;  but  still  no  man  follows  him,  unless  the \n— —  Father  shew  him  something  else  within,  and  in \nother  ways  draw  him :  nay,  the  whole  world  per- \nsecutes that  Son,  whom  he  shews.

These,  who  live \nby  the  Spirit  and  are  moved  by  the  Spirit,  follow \nwhithersoever  God  willeth,  and  whatsoever  he \nshall  have  shewn  them.  But  the  ungodly  cometh \nnot,  even  when  he  hath  heard  the  word,  except  the \nFather  draw  and  teach  within;  which  he  does  by \nbestowing  the  Spirit.  In  them  is  another  drawing, \ndistinct  from  that  which  is  without;  in  them \nChrist  is  shewn  by  the  illumination  of  the  Spirit, \nthrough  which  the  man  is  married  off  to  Christ  by \na  most  delightful  ravishment,  and  rather  endures \nthe  act  of  a  speaking  teacher  and  a  drawing  God, \nthan  performs  one  himself  by  seeking  and  running/ \n\nr  Illuminaiionem  SpiriMs.']  Not  '  the  enlightening  of  the \nman's  own  soul,'  but  <  the  throwing  of  light  upon  Christ :'  the \nblessed  Spirit  casts  his  bright  beams  upon  the  face,  or  person, \nof  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ;  and  so  wins  to  him. — A  most  beautiful \nand  accurate  description  this,  of  that  Holy  Ghost  violence,  with \nwhich  the  soul  is  converted.  One  can  hardly  help  saying  to \nLuther,  0  si  sic  omnia!  A  single  testimony,  like  this  broad  and \nirresistible  one,  opened  as  he  opens  it,  is  worth  a  hundred \nabstruse  and  obscure  ones  3  of  which  it  is  a  question  in  the \nfirst  place,  whether  they  bear  at  all  upon  the  subject — secondly, \nhow  they  exactly  bear  upon  it — and  thirdly,  with  what  degree \nof  effect. — I  am  not  meaning  to  disparage  Luther's  testi- \nmonies— which,  with  a  few  exceptions,  are  clear,  and  strong  to \nthe  point ;  but  I  think  the  question  might  be  safely  rested  upon \nthis  single  text — considered  in  its  connection — and  that,  on  such \na  subject,  to  bring  those  which  will  admit  of  a  doubt,  or  of  a \npossible  misconstruction-^ — in  short  to  use  any  other  implement \nthan  a  sledge-hammer — is  unwise.  Even  Luther  might  have \nmade  his  proofs  clearer  and  stronger  -f  and  they  would  have \nlost  nothing  by  being  fewer.  The  impression  is  weakened  by \nbeing  extended  5  and  many  small  blows,  of  which  one  or  two \nbeat  the  air,  render  the  victory  doubtful,  in  the  sight  of  the \nby-standers.  (See  above,  Part  iv.  Sect.  xlii.  note  i.) — But \nwhat  have  we  here  ?  It  is  not  only  that  the  words  are  so \nexpress  it  is  impossible  to  evade  them,,  and  that  to  cite  them \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  455 \n\nI  will  brine:  yet  one  more  text  from  this  same     sect. \nJohn,  who  in  his  sixteenth  chapter  says,  \"  The  spirit  \n\n\nshall  reprove  the  world  of  sin,  because  they  have \nnot  believed  in  me/'  (John  xvi.  9.)  Here  you  Johnxvi.9. \nsee  it  is  sin  not  to  believe  in  Christ.  But  this  sin, \nsurely,  is  not  fixed  in  the  skin  or  in  the  hair,  but \nin  the  very  understanding  and  will.  Now,  when \nhe  charges  the  whole  world  with  this  sin,  and  it \nis  ascertained  by  experience  that  this  sin  of  theirs \nis  as  unknown  to  the  world  as  Christ  himself — \nseeing  it  is  that  which  is  revealed  by  the  reprov- \ning of  the  Spirit — it  is  plain  that  Freewill,  together \nwith  its  will  and  understanding,  is  considered  as \ncaptured,  and  condemned  for  this  sin,  before  God. \nSo  then,  whilst  Freewill  is  ignorant  of  Christ  and \ndoes  not  believe  in  him,  she  cannot  will  or  endea- \nvour after  any  good  thing,  but  is  necessarily  the \nslave  of  this  unknown  sin.  In  short,  since  the \nScriptures  preach  Christ  in  a  way  of  comparison \nand  opposition  every  where,  as  I  have  said; \nrepresenting  every  thing  which  hath  not  the \nSpirit  of  Christ  as  the  subject  of  Satan,  ungod- \nliness, error,  darkness,  sin  and  the  wrath  of  God; \nhow  many  soever  testimonies  there  be  which \nspeak  of  Christ,  these  will,  all  and  every  of  them, \nfight  against  Freewill.  Now  such  testimonies  are \ninnumerable ;  nay,  they  make  up  the  whole  of \n\nis  even  more  impressive  than  to  enlarge  upon  them,,  but  they \nmust  mean  what  they  say — '  There  is  no  power  whatsoever  in \nthe  natural  man  to  come  to  Christ ' — because  otherwise  they \nhave  no  meaning  at  all,  in  this  context. — The  Lord  is  account- \ning for  their  murmurs,  in  which  they  muttered  out  a  rejection \nof  him.  fYou  reject  me!  What  wonder?  It  cannot  be \notherwise,  seeing  ye  are  not  drawn  to  me  of  God.' — And  when  he \nrepeats  the  same  sentiment  at  the  65th  verse,  it  is  to  account \nfor  the  same  fact,  and  is  followed  by  a  consequence  which \nwould  naturally  result  from  such  a  declaration  ;  but  which  no \nother  sentiment  would  account  for.  \"  From  that  time  many \nof  his  disciples  went  back  and  walked  no  more  with  him.  Then  fc \nsaid  Jesus  unto  the  twelve,  l'  Will  ye  also  go  away  ?\"  The \ntestimony  therefore  is  so  unequivocal,  as  well  as  so  decisive,, \nthat  Freewill  has  not  even  a  heel  to  lift  up  against  it. \n\n\n456  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  Scripture.     So  that  if  we  try  this  cause  at  the \n'  judgment  seat  of  Scripture,  I  shall  conquer  every- \nway ; s  there  not  being  a  single  jot  or  tittle  remain- \ning, but  what  condemns  the  dogma  of  Freewill. \n\nNow  although  our  great  theologians  and  main- \ntamers  of  Freewill  either  know  not,  or  pretend  not \nto  know,  that  the  Scripture  thus  preaches  Christ \nin  the  way  of  comparison  and  opposition,  still  all \nChristians  know  this,  and  publicly  confess  it. \nThey  know  I  say,  that  there  are  two  kingdoms  in \nthe  world,  which  are  most  adversative  to  each \nother ;  that  Satan  reigns  in  the  one,  and  is  on  this \naccount  called  by  Christ  the  Prince  of  this  w7orld, \nand  by  Paul  the  God  of  this  age ;  holding  all  men \ncaptive  at  his  will,  who  have  not  been  torn  from \nhim  by  the  Spirit  of  Christ,  as  the  same  Paul \nwitnesseth  ;  and  not  sivffering  them  to  be  torn \nfrom  him  by  any  force,  save  by  the  Spirit  of  God; \nas  Christ  testifies  in  his  parable  of  the  strong  man \nkeeping  his  palace  in  peace.  In  the  other  reigneth \nChrist:  whose  kingdom  is  continually  resisting \nand  fighting  with  that  of  Satan.  Into  this  kingdom \nwe  are  translated,  not  by  our  own  power,  but  by \nthe  grace  of  God;  by  which  we  are  delivered  from \nthis  present  wicked  age,  and  snatched  out  of  the \nhands  of  the  power  of  darkness.  The  knowledge \nand  confession  of  these  kingdoms,  as  fighting  per- \npetually against  each  other  with  such  might  and \nresolution,  would  be  of  itself  sufficient  to  confute \nthe  dogma  of  Freewill :  seeing  that  we  are  com- \npelled to  serve  in  the  kingdom  of  Satan,  unless  we \nbe   rescued  from  it  by  a  divine  power.     These \n\n5  Omnibus  modis  vicero.']  Omn.  mod.  like  iravil  Tpo-rrw,  or \nKarairavra  rpoTrov,  of  the  Greeks,  expresses  the  manner  in  which \nany  act  is]  done,  or  event  accomplished  :  '  By  what  arts  and \nmeans  soever,  or  with  what  spirit  and  turn  of  mind  soever,  the \ncontest  be  carried  on,  I  shall  have  conquered  so  as  not  to  leave \na  single  jot  or  tittle  for  Freewill.' — The  argument  is,  Scrip- \nture preaches  Christ  by  antithesis ;  therefore,  whatsoever \npreaches  Christ  excludes  Freewill.  But  Christ  is  preached \nevery  where  :  therefore  Freewill  is  opposed  every  where. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  457 \n\nthings,  I  say,  the  vulgar  know,  and  by  their  sect. \nproverbs,  prayers,  efforts  and  whole  life,  ahund-  xxxi. \nantly  confess.1 \n\nI  omit  that  truly  Achillean  argument  of  mine,  Omits  to \nwhich   Diatribe   in   her   noble   courage   has   left  g^SS \nuntouched;  namely,  that  in  Romans  vii.  and  Gala-  between \ntians  v.  Paul  teaches  us  that  the  conflict  between  fle.sl?  ar}d_ \nflesh  and  spirit  is  so  mighty  in  the  sanctified  and  cause  no \ngodly,  that  they  cannot  do  the  things  which  they  attempt \nwould.  I  argue  thus  from  it:  if  the  nature  of  man  is  teen  made \nso  wicked,  that  in  those  who  have  been  born  again  to  repel \nof  the  Spirit,  not  only  it  does  not  endeavour  after  ^satd \ngood,but  even  fights  against  and  opposes  good ;  how  about  it. \nshould  it  endeavour  after  good  in  those  who,  being \nnot  yet  regenerated,  are  serving  under  Satan,  in \nthe  old  man  ?  For  Paul  does  not  speak  of  the  gross \naffections  only  in  that  place,  through  which  as  a \nsort  of  common  outlet  Diatribe  is  wont  to  slip  like \nan  eel  out  of  the  hands  of  every  Scripture;  but \nreckons  heresy,  idolatry,  dissensions,  contentions, \nmischiefs,  which  reign  in  those  highest  powers  of \nthe  soul — the  understanding  and  the  will,  say — \namongst  the  works  of  the  flesh.     If  then  the  flesh \nmaintains  a  conflict  against  the  spirit,  by  means  of \n\nt  How  strange  that  this  enlightened  and  enlightening  view \nof  the  two  kingdoms  should  he  so  little  realized.,  substantiated \nand  applied !  this,  which  needs  only  to  be  carried  back  to  the \nperiod  of  the  fall,  and  thence  continued  downwards  to  the  end \nof  the  world,  with  an  understanding,  that  this  is  not  the  crea- \ntion state  of  man,  and  the  things  of  man,  but  the  counsel \nand  scheme  of  God  as  made  way  for  by  the  creation  and  the \nfall — to  render  all  Scripture,  history,  observation  and  expe- \nrience, simple  and  intelligible  ! — Luther  evidently  did  not \ncomprehend  them  in  the  fulness  of  their  origination,  design, \noperations  and  results  ;  but  the  substance  is  here — and  we  can \nscarcely  help  breathing  out  the  vain  wish  that  he  had,  for  his \nown  comfort,  and  that  of  others  whom  the  Lord  hath  not  dis- \ndained to  edify  by  his  writings,  been  enabled  to  put  the \nelements,  with  which  he  here  furnishes  us,  together,  in  their \nbeginning  and  endings,  and  in  the  connection  of  the  interme- \ndiate parts,  in  a  workmanlike  manner.  He  has  the  materials  ; \nbut  he  neither  models,  nor  lays  the  foundation,  nor  buildeth \nthereon.

On  this  account  Rom.  viii.  calls  it  enmity \nagainst  God.u \n\nI  should  be  glad,  I  say,  if  any  body  would  take \noff  this  argument  for  me,  and  defend  Freewill \nfrom  it. \n\nFor  my  own  part,  I  confess  that,  if  it  could  any \nhow  be,  I  should  be  unwilling  to  have  Freewill \ngiven  to  me,  or  any  thing  left  in  my  own  hand, \nwhich  might  enable  me  to  endeavour  after  salva- \ntion :  not  only  because  in  the  midst  of  so  many \ndangers  and  adversities  on  the  one  hand,  and  of \nso  many  assaulting  devils  on  the  other,  I  should \nnot  be  strong  enough  to  maintain  my  standing \nand  keep  my  hold  of  it  (for  one  devil  is  mightier \nthan  all  men  put  together,  and  not  a  single  indi- \nvidual of  mankind  would  be  saved) ;  but  because, \nif  there  were  even  no  dangers,  and  no  adversities, \nand  no  devils,  still  I  should  be  compelled  to  toil \nfor  ever  as  uncertainly,  and  to  fight  as  one  that \nbeateth  the  air.v  For,  though  I  should  live  and \nwork  to  eternity,  my  own  conscience  would  never \nbe  sure  and  secure  how  much  she  ought  to  do, \nthat  God  might  be  satisfied  with  her.  Do  what \nshe  might,  there  would  still  be  left  an  anxious \ndoubt,  whether  it  pleased  God,  or  whether  he \nrequired  any  thing  more;  as  the  experience  of  all \nself-righteous  persons x  proves,  and  as  I,  to  my \n\nu  I  have  already  shewn  that  I  do  not  coincide  with  Luther  in \nhis  representation  of  the  flesh  and  the  spirit :  that  I  consider \nthe  flesh  and  the  spirit  to  be  the  unrenewed  body  and  the \nrenewed  mind,  severally,  of  the  Lord's  called  people.  But \nthis  difference  does  not  affect  the  argument  here.  If  the \nrenewed  man,  who  has  the  Spirit,  have  this  conflict  to  main- \ntain ;  what  is  the  wholly  unrenewed  man  before  God,  and  what \nhis  endeavour  after  good  ? \n\nv  LaborareJ]  The  allusion  is  evidently  to  1  Cor.  ix.  26. — \nbut  he  does  not  use  the  word  currere.

No  one/  says  he,  shall  pluck  them  out \nof  my  hand ;  for  my  Father  who  gave  them  me,  is \ngreater  than  all.  Thus  it  comes  to  pass,  that,  if \nall  are  not  saved,  some,  however,  nay,  many  are ; \nwhereas  by  the  power  of  Freewill  none  absolutely \n■would  be,  but  we  should  all  to  a  man  be  lost? \nMoreover,  we  are  fearlessly  sure  that  we  please \nGod,  not  by  the  merit  of  our  own  work,  but  by  the \nfavour  of  his  mercy,  which  he  hath  promised  us  ; \nand  that,  if  we  do  less  than  we  ought,  or  ought \namiss,  he  does  not  impute  it  to  us,  but  with  a \nfatherly  mind  forgives  and  amends  it.  Such  is \nthe  boast  of  every  saint  in  his  God.z \n\nhere,  e  persons  who  are  going  about  to  establish  their  own \nrighteousness,'  in  opposition  to  c  those  who  have  learned  that \nthere  is  a  God-righteousness  and  have  been  led  to  submit \nto  it.' — c  Justicers,'  or  c  righteousness-mongers.' \n\ny  Ovcelr  implies  more  than  no  man;  no  person,  manor  devil. \n\nz  The  defects  of  Luther's  theology  are  apparent  in  this \nparagraph.  He  gives  quietness,  but  not  triumph ;  quietness \ntoo,  we  know  not  why — when  a  reason  might  be  assigned.  We \nare  to  live,  assuredly  to  live ;  we  do  not  yet  live  :  we  are  to \nwork  too,  that  we  may  live  ;  and  our  workings  must  be  for- \ngiven and  amended. — He  did  not  see  Christ's  peculiar  and \npeculiarizing  headship  :  he  did  not  see  that  the  efficacy  of \nChrist  is  his  enabling  God,  by  His  dying,  to  raise  up  the  cursed \nfrom  their  curse  after  suffering  a  part  of  it ;  that  they  live,  even \nnow,  in  a  risen  Christ  as  though  they  had  risen  with  him  •  and \nthat  it  is  eternal  life  already  received  and  acted — just  in  such \nmeasure  as  He  is  pleased  to  bestow  of  it — which  constitutes \nthe  acceptable  service  they  are  now  rendering :  which  service  He, \nas  he  hath  appointed,  and  just  in  such  measure  and  manner \n\n\n460 \n\n\nBONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL."

Behold,  God  so  governs  this  mate- \nJ  rial  world  in  outward  things,  that,  if  you  observe \n\nand  follow  the  judgment  of  human  reason,  you \nare  compelled  to  say,  either  there  is  no  God,  or \nthere  is  an  unjust  God  ;  as  that  poet  says,  \"  I  am \noften  solicited  to  think  that  there  are  no  Gods.\" \nFor,  see  how  true  it  is,  that  the  wicked  are  most \nprosperous,  and  the  good,  on  the  other  hand,  most \nunfortunate  ;  even  proverbs,  and  experience,  who \nis  the  mother  of  proverbs,  testifying,  that  'the \nwickeder  men  are,  the  more  fortunate/  iC  The \ntabernacles  of  the  wicked  abound,\"  says  Job;  and \nthe  73d  Psalm  complains  that  sinners  abound \nwith  riches,  in  this  world.d  Is  it  not  most  unjust \nin  the  judgment  of  all  men,  pray,  that  the  wicked \nshould  be  prospered  and  the  good  afflicted?6  Yet \n\n\nevil  eye :  e  an  evil  eye  is  one  which  is  either  unsound  generally, \nor  is  infected  with  the  particular  disease  of  envy,  malice  and \nblasphemy.'     See  Matt.  vi.  23.  xx.  15.  Mark  vii.  22. \n\nd  Job  xii.  6.  Psalm  lxxiii.  12.  Our  version  says,  \"  The \ntabernacles  of  robbers  prosper.\"  \"  Behold,  these  are  the \nungodly  who  prosper  in  the  world  ;  they  increase  in  riches.\" \n\ne  Luther  feels  a  difficulty  in  reconciling  the  condemnation  of \nthe  reprobate  with  God's  justice.  In  fact  he  acknowledges \nthat  he  cannot ;  begs  off,  and  makes  unwarrantable  conces- \nsions. This  difficulty  arises  from  his  imperfect  conception  of \nthe  creation  and  fall  of  man.  If  every  individual  of  the  human \nrace  had  a  distinct  personal  subsistence  given  to  him,  in  the \ncreation  of  Adam ;  and,  consequently,  had  a  distinct  personal \nsubsistence  in  him,  when  he  brake  his  commandment;  and,  as \nthis  distinct  substance,  was  one  with  him  who  by  his  alone  per- \nsonal agency  did  break  that  commandment  (the  union  of  these \nmany  distinct  substances  in  and  with  his  one  substance  nowise \ncontradicting  the  alone  and  distinct  agency  of  the  one  first \nman,  Adam)  ■  where  is  the  injustice  of  God's  bringing  out \neach  of  these  distinct  individuals,  one  after  another,  into \nmanifest  existence  and  distinct  personal  agency,  and — having \ngiven  to  them  individually,  for  the  most  part,  the  opportunity \nof  shewing  what  they  are  according  to  their  own  making  of \nthemselves,  not  according  to  his  making  of  them — inflict- \ning upon  them  the  judgment  which  he  had  distinctly \nfore-announced,  which  by  their  disobedience  as  one  with \nAdam  they  had  wilfully  incurred,  and  which  for  the  most \npart  they  have  by  their  own  subsequent  actings  in  this  world \nproved  to  be  their  due,,  suitable,  and  self-made  portion  ?     If \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  463 \n\nsuch  is  the  course  of  the  world.     It  is  here,  that     sect. \neven  the  greatest  wits  have  fallen  to  the  depth  of \n\nGod  has  been  pleased  to  make  provision  for  the  mitigation, \nremoval  and  reversal  of  this  sentence  in  some  of  those  who \nhave  justly  incurred  it,  clearly  they  who  suffer  have  justly \nincurred  it  *  and  therefore  God  is  only  just  in  inflicting  it. — \nThrough  not  discerning  the  mystery  of  the  creation,  Luther \naccounted  God  the  creator  of  these  wicked  ones,  as  we  have \nseveral  times  seen ;  and,  through  not,  in  consequence,  discerning \ntheir  participation  in  the  fall,  he  accounted  God  their  debtor  to \ngive  them  an  equivalent  for  that  Freewill,  or  rather  that  know- \nledge of  only  good,  which  Adam  had  possessed,  and  which  he  did \nnot  see  how  they  had  forfeited  :  I  say  knowledge  of  only  good, \nbecause  Adam  had  no  more  of  Freewill  properly  so  called,  than \nwe  have,  as  hath  been  shewn.  With  respect  to  the  justice  of \nGod  in  this  transaction  then,  there  can  be  no  question  ;  though \nLuther  makes  one.  Justice  is  the  fulfilment  of  relations;  God \nhad  fulfilled  all  His,  when  man  incurred  his  fore-announced \ncurse — then  what  does  justice  require,  but  that  it  be  ex- \nacted? Again  ;  with  respect  to  God's  right  of  instituting \nsuch  relations  as  He  did  between  himself  and  the  human  race \nin  Adam,  there  can  be  no  question.  God  has  a  right  to  form \nany  creature  that  he  is  pleased  and  has  power  to  form.  To  be \nconsistent  with  himself,  he  will  give  them  due  relations,  and \nwill  fulfil  his  own  part  in  those  relations.  Now,  what  was \nwanting  in  the  relations  he  gave  to  Adam  ?  Did  He  not  give \nhim  reason  and  knowledge,  by  which  he  ought  to  have  resisted \nthe  temptation  ?  And  if  Adam  had  enough,  what  could  the \ndistinct  substances  which  were  in  him  complain,  if  God  put  their \nsafety  upon  the  issue  of  his  obedience  ?  What  difference \nwould  there  have  been,  or  could  they  pretend  that  there  would \nhave  been,  in  the  result,  if  each  of  them  distinctly  and  personally \nhad  undergone  the  same  trial  ? — But  I  do  not  deem  this  con- \nsideration at  all  necessary :  it  is  the  union  and  unity  of  each \nindividual  of  the  human  race,  still  retaining  his  individuality, \nwith  Adam,  which  constitutes  his  original  sin  and  his  original \nguilt  3  and  from  which  the  loss  of  his  creation  state  and  of  his \ncreation  character  was  derived. — The  only  question  that  can  be \nasked  in  all  this  mystery  respects  the  goodness,  that  is,  the  loving- \nkindness  of  God.  It  is  here  that  Paul  puts  the  difficulty  ;  here \nthat  he  calls  for  submission  5  and  here  that  he  assigns  the \nprinciple  of  the  procedure.  \"Is  there  not  unrighteousness  r\" \nFor  it  will  come  to  this,  no  man  hath  done  otherwise  than \nGod  designed.  The  answer  is,  God  has  exercised  his  right  of \nthe  potter,  and  has  exercised  it  for  a  great  and  wise  reason. — \n\"  What  if  etc.  ?'\" — The  man  whose  eyes  the  Lord  hath  opened \nwill  see,  and  will  search  into,  these  things,  and  will  justify  God \nat  his  heart.  Nor  will  Paul,  with  his  Isaiah,  condemn  him.  He \nis  using  what  God  hath  done  and  hath  revealed  unto  the  very \n\n\n464  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npart  v.  denying  that  there  is  a  God,  and  of  feigning  that \nFortune  turns  and  twists  everything,  as  the  whim \ntakes  her :  such  were  the  Epicureans  and  Pliny. \nFollowing  close  upon  these,  Aristotle,  to  deliver \nthat  first  Being  of  his  from  misery,  is  of  opinion, \nthat  he  does  not  see  any  of  the  things  that  exist, \nbut  himself;  because  he  considers  that  it  would \nbe  most  painful  to  him  to  see  so  much  of  evil,  so \nmuch  of  injustice/ \n\nThe  Prophets,  on  the  other  hand,  who  believed \nthat  there  is  a  God,  are  more  tempted  with  the \nsuggestion  of  God's  injustice  :  as  Jeremiah,  Job, \nDavid,  Asaph  and  others.  What  do  you  imagine \nDemosthenes  and  Cicero  to  have  thought,  when, \nafter  having  done  all  they  could,  they  received \nsuch  wages  as  they  did,  in  a  wretched  death?5 \nYet  this  injustice  of  God,  which  is  exceedingly \nprobable,  and  inferred  by  such  arguments  as  no \npower  of  reason  or  light  of  nature  can  resist,  is \nmost  easily  removed  by  the  light  of  the  Gospel \nand  the  knowledge  of  grace;  which  teaches  us, \nthat  the  wicked  flourish,  it  is  true,  in  their  body, \n\nend  for  which  He  hath  done  and  hath  revealed  it.

The  latter  was  a \nwellbred,  lettered  persecutor  of  Christians ;  but  too  proud  to \ninquire  into  their  doctrines,  and  not  afraid,  though  reluctant, \nto  shed  their  blood.

Let  it  be  conceded, \nthat  there  are  three  great  lights — the  light  of \nnature,  the  light  of  grace,  and  the  light  of  glory- \naccording  to  the  common  distinction,  which  is  a \ngood  one.  In  the  light  of  nature,  it  is  a  fact  not \nto  be  explained,  that  it  is  just  the  good  man  be \nafflicted,  and  the  bad  man  prosper.  But  the  light \nof  grace  resolves  this  question.  In  the  light  of \ngrace  it  is  inexplicable,  how  God  condemns  the \nman,  who  cannot,  by  any  power  of  his  own,  do \notherwise  than  sin,  and  be  guilty.  In  this  case,  the \nlight  of  nature,  as  well  as  the  light  of  grace, \ndeclares  that  the  fault  is  not  in  wretched  man  but \nin  unjust  God.  For  how  can  they  judge  other- \nwise of  God?  seeing  he  crowns  a  wicked  man \ngratuitously  without  any  merits,  and  does  not \ncrown  another  but  condemns  him — who  perhaps \nis  less,  or  at  the  worst  not  more  wicked. — But \nthe  light  of  glory  proclaims  something  else,  and, \nwhen  it  arrives,  will  shew  God,  whose  judgment \n\n2  h \n\n\n466  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\npap.t  v.   is  for  the  present  that  of  incomprehensible  justice, \n\n~ to  be  only  that  of  most  just  and  most  manifest \n\njustice  ;  teaching  us,  in  the  mean  time,  to  believe, \nthe  certainty  of  this  event,  admonished  and  con- \nfirmed, as  we  are,  in  and  unto  the  expectation  of  it, \nby  the  example  of  the  light  of  grace,  which  accom- \nplishes a  like  prodigy  with  respect  to  the  light  of \nnature.11 \nsect.  Here  I  shall  put  an  end  to  this  treatise :  pre- \nxxxiv.  pared,  if  need  be,  to  plead  the  cause  yet  further; \nalthough  I  consider,  that  I  have  in  this  said \nargument  abundantly  enough  to  satisfy  the  pious  mind, \nwhich  is  willing  to  yield  to  the  force  of  truth \nwithout  pertinacity.  For,  if  we  believe  it  to  be \ntrue,  that  God  foreknows  and  predestinates  every \nthing ;  moreover,  that  he  can  neither  be  mis- \ntaken, nor  hindered,  in  his  foreknowledge  and  pre- \ndestination ;  and,  once  more,  that  nothing  is  done \n.  without  his  will  (a  truth  which  reason  herself  is  com- \npelled to  yield) )  it  follows,  from  the  testimony  of \nthe  selfsame  reason,  that  there  can  be  no  such \nthing  as  Freewill  in  man  or  angel,  or  any  crea- \nture.    So  again;  if  we  believe  Satan  to  be  the \n\nh  If  the  observations  of  the  preceding  note  be  correct,  we  do \nnot  want  Luther's  illustration,  with  its  distinctions.  We  need \nnot  wait  for  the  decision  and  discoveries  of  the  great  day,  to \nsee  God  just.  Nor  are  his  assumptions  admissible.  God  has \nnever  left  the  eternity  of  man  and  the  future  judgment  without \nwitness.  If  these  things  have  been  obscured,  it  is  not  by  God's \nhaving  put  them  into  the  dark,  but  because  men  have  wilfully \nshut  their  eyes  to  them.  The  new  creation  kingdom  was \nannounced  at  the  fall — and  has  been  variously  preached  ever \nsince,  to  the  whole  earth.  The  kingdom  of  grace  does  not \nleave  God  under  the  suspicion  of  injustice  ;  man  has  made \nhimself  that  damned  thing  which  he  is.  The  elect  are  not \ncrowned  sinners.  The  union  of  the  elect  with  Christ,  and  the \nlack  of  this  union,  with  its  consequent  self-left  state,  in  the  repro- \nbate, explains  both  dooms,  in  perfect  consistency  with  divine \nequity.  The  illustration,  therefore,  is  both  unneeded  and  untrue  : \nunneeded,inasmuch  as  th  e  spiritual  man  even  now  sees  the  inflexi- \nble justice  of  God  to  be  without  spot — what  it  assuredly  is ;  and \nuntrue,  inasmuch  as  Luther's  insolvable  questions  are  resolved \nunder  those  lights  which  he  declares  to  be  severally  inadequate. \n\n\nFREEWILL  PROVED  TO  BE  A  LIE.  467 \n\nPrince  of  this  world,  who  is  perpetually  plotting     sect. \nand  lighting  against  the  kingdom  of  Christ,  with    x^ \nall  his  might,  so  that  he  doth  not  let  his  captives \nof  human  kind  go,  unless  he  be  driven  out  by  a \ndivine  power ;  again  it  is  manifest,  that  there  can \nbe  no  such  thing  as  Freewill. \n\nSo  again,  if  we  believe  original  sin1  to  have \nso  ruined  us,  as  to  make  most  troublesome  work \neven  for  those  who  are  led  by  the  Spirit,  through \nstriving,  as  it  does,  against  good  in  them ;  it  is \nclear,  that  nothing  is  left  in  man  as  devoid  of  the \nSpirit,  which  can  turn  itself  to  good,  but  only \nwhat  turns  itself  to  evil.  Again  •  if  the  Jews, \nwho  followed  after  righteousness  with  all  their \nmight,  have  fallen  headlong  the  rather  into  un- \nrighteousnes :  and  the  Gentiles,  who  were  follow- \ning after  unrighteousness,  have  freely  and  un- \nhopedly  attained  to  righteousness ;  it  is  manifest, \nas  in  the  former  instances,  by  very  deed  and \nexperience,  that  man  without  grace  can  will \nnothing  but  evil.  In  fine  ;  if  we  believe  Christ  to \nhave  redeemed  man  by  his  blood,  we  are  obliged \nto  confess  that  the  whole  man  was  undone ;  else \nwe  shall  make  Christ  either  superfluous,  or  the \nredeemer  of  the  vilest  part  in  man :  which  is  blas- \nphemous and  sacrilegious.1\" \n\n'  A  still  inferior  view  to  what  he  has  given  us  before  of \noriginal  sin,  but  a  very  common  one  :  he  here  takes  it  for \nthat  vitiation  of  nature.,  which  is  the  consequence  of  it — instead \nof  that  first  sin,  which  gave  origin  to  the  vitiation. — But  the \nargument  against  Freewill  is  not  affected ;  the  consequent \nvitiation  is  in  nowise  less  than  he  represents  it  to  be. \n\nk  He  briefly  recites  certain  additional  considerations,  which \nmust,  each  of  them,  be  conclusive  upon  this  subject.  1.  God's \nforeknowledge  and  predestination.  2.  Satan's  lordship  over \nthe  world.  3.  Original  sin.  4.  The  case  of  the  apostate \nand  rejected  Jews,  as  contrasted  with  the  conversion  of  the \nGentiles.  5.

I \nconfess,  thou  art  a  great  man,  adorned  with  many \nof  the   noblest   gifts   by    God;  not   to   mention \nothers,  with  genius,  and  learning,  and  eloquence, \neven  to  a  miracle.     On  the  other  hand,  I  have \nnothing,    and   am   nothing ;    save    that   I    could \nalmost  glory   in   being   a   Christian.     Again ;  I \ngreatly  commend  and    extol    you  for  this  thing \nalso,  that  you  are  the  only  man  of  all  my  antago- \nnists that  hath  attacked  the  heart  of  the  subject, \nthe  head  of  the  cause  ;  instead  of  wearing  me  out \nwith  those  extraneous  points,  the  Papacy,  Pur- \ngatory, Indulgences,  and  a  number  of  like  topics, \nWhich  may  more  fitly  be  called  trifles,  than  matters \nof  debate :  a  sort  of  chase,  in  which  nearly  all  my \nopponents  have  been  hunting  me  hitherto  in  vain. \nYou  are  that  single  and  solitary  individual,  who \nhath  seen  the  hinge  of  the  matters  in  dispute,  and \nhath  aimed  at  the  neck :    I  thank  you  for  this \nfrom  my  heart — it  is  far  more  to   my  taste  to  be \noccupied  in  debating  this  question,  so  far  as  time \nand  leisure  are  accorded  me.     If  those  who  have \nheretofore  attacked  me  had  done  the   same ;  if \n\n\nCONCLUSION.  469 \n\nthose  who  are  just  at  this  time  making  their  boast \nof  new  spirits,  and  new  revelations,  would  do  so; \nwe  should  have  less  of  sedition  and  divisions,  as \nwell  as  more  of  peace  and  concord.  But  God \nthus  stirs  up  Satan  to  punish  our  ingratitudes \n\nHowbeit,  unless  you  can  plead  this  cause  in  a \nstyle  somewhat  different  from  your  Diatribe,  I \ncould  earnestly  wish  that  you  would  be  content \nwith  your  own  proper  good,  and  would  cultivate, \nadorn  and  advance  the  cause  of  literature  and  the \nlanguages,  as  you  have  heretofore  done,  with \ngreat  profit  and  praise.  By  this  pursuit  of  yours \nyou  have  even  served  me  not  a  little ;  insomuch \nthat  I  confess  myself  greatly  your  debtor,  even  as \nI  most  assuredly  venerate  you,  and  sincerely  look \nup  to  you  as  my  superior,  in  that  particular. \nGod  hath  not  yet  willed,  nor  given  to  you,  that \nyou  should  be  equal  to  this  cause  !  Pray  do  not \nthink  that  I  say  this  with  any  arrogancy. \n\nAnd  yet  I  do  implore  the  Lord  to  make  you  as \nmuch  my  superior  in  this  particular  speedily,  as \nyou  already  are  in  all  others.  Nor  is  it  any  thing \nnew,  that  God  should  instruct  a  Moses  by  Jethro, \nor  a  Paul  by  Ananias.  As  to  what  you  say,  that \nyou  have  failed,  miserably  indeed,  of  your  aim,  if \nyou  do  not  know  Christ;  I  think,  you  must  be \n\na  Ita  per  Satanam.']  Very  true  as  to  instrumentality.  But \nwhence  then  comes  this  ingratitude  ?  Could  not  God  cure  it  ? \nCould  not  he  drive  out  the  Canaanite  altogether  from  the \nland  ?  Regenerate  man,  and  a  revived  church,  is  still  Adam  ; \n|  and  it  is  the  glory  of  God  to  save  and  glorify  an  Adam.  He \nmust  be  shewn  therefore,  or  rather  must  shew  himself  what  he \nis.  His  Canaan  is  not  yet  the  Lord's  world — neither  is  he  yet \nthe  risen  God-man.  The  time  of  ingratitude  is  yet ;  and  is \nyet,  because  the  Lord's  real  and  designed  glory  requires  that  it \nshould  be  so.— There  is  something  satisfying,  and  cheering,  and \nenlightening,  in  this  view  of  the  Lord's  present  dealings  with \nhis  church  and  people,  which  reconciles  us  to  what  must  other- \nwise be  a  constant  burden  and  distress — and  which  leaves  no \nmore  questions  to  be  asked.  Luther  had  not  distinct  percep- \ntions of  the  origin,  and  nature,  and  design  of  evil ;  and  whilst \nhe  talked  much  of  Satan,  did  not  understand  him  well  enough \nto  put  him  in  his  place. \n\n\n470  BONDAGE  OF  THE  WILL. \n\naware  yourself  what  sort  of  a  saying  this  is.  All \nwill  not  therefore  be  in  the  wrong,  because  you  or \nI,  if  it  be  so,  are  in  the  wrong.  God  is  declared \nto  be  a  God  that  is  wonderful  in  his  saints;  so \nthat  we  may  count  those  for  saints,  who  are  the \nfarthest  off  from  saintship.  Nor  is  it  hard  to  sup- \npose, that  you,  being  a  man,  may  neither  rightly \nunderstand,  nor  with  sufficient  diligence  observe, \neither  the  Scriptures  or  the  sayings  of  the  Fathers, \nby  whose  guidance  you  imagine  that  you  have  ob- \ntained your  aim.  We  have  a  pretty  good  hint \nto  this  effect,  when  you  write  that  you  do  not  assert \nat  all,  but  confer.  The  man  who  sees  clearly  through \nthe  whole  of  his  subject,  and  understands  it  cor- \nrectly, does  not  write  thus.  I,  for  my  part,  have \nnot  conferred,  but  asserted,  in  this  book ;  yea,  and \nI  do  assert.  Neither  is  it  my  desire  to  appoint  any \nman  judge  in  this  cause:  I  persuade  all  to  receive \nmy  decree.  The  Lord,  whose  cause  this  is,  shine \nupon  you — and  make  you  a  vessel  unto  honour \nand  glory  !     Amen. \n\n\nLondon:  Printed  by  A.
